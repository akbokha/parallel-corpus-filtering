this document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ ling thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , a psychological disorder where the patient altern@@ ates man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal sen@@ timent .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral in@@ gest@@ ing of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be applied for inser@@ ting or the melting tablets in patients that cause difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy should be adapted to the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy .
this interfer@@ es with the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells among each other .
Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be a &quot; partial Ag@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent , acts as the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mitter in order to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their occurrence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that led to increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with abili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased un@@ eas@@ iness caused by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and absor@@ bs the solution .
in both studies with injection solutions , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly reduced the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than those receiving placebo .
in the course of the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented the re @-@ occurrence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and when it was given an additional treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for inser@@ tion ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders , nausea , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , in@@ som@@ nia ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes and were able to out@@ weigh the man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption if oral therapy is not suitable compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ ta@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy across the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mostly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients with ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide using Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics in patients with bi@@ polar disorder .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ line disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ ery and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , this should be considered to reduce the dose or to break down the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study of fixed doses , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients suffering from diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly with regard to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia as a result of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is to be expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ zers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metaboli@@ zers .
if you consider the joint application of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before starting the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate rise in Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ mb@@ or@@ phi@@ c / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ mb@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation concerning safety in humans and due to the concerns arising in the reproduction studies of the animal , unless the possible benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including par@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ an@@ sia , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7,@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar I Dis@@ order - in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dosing , as Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma performance binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine levels and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
administered by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks to healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the Put@@ name .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who adher@@ ed to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including PA@@ N@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Depres@@ sions@@ Rate Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol .
Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 26 weeks with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l group and 57 % of placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I defect , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared placebo no superior efficacy .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in week 3 versus placebo , which was comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia in week 12 , like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which were partially based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum levels , adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial lasting 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ li@@ zation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination duration amounts to approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metaboli@@ zers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ zers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , nor did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients show no gender @-@ related effects .
a quantitative study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no clin@@ ically significant differences in respect to eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with varying liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated injection , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ reno@@ cor@@ tical tox@@ ici@@ ency ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al rin@@ ds / carcin@@ omas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the average c@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ g@@ atives of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study about 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ u@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in order to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the treatment should be continued with the same dose .

hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study involving healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .

man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar I Dis@@ order - in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine levels and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar I defect , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was not superior to placebo .
in a relative bio @-@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 In addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average c@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
abili@@ fy injection solution is used for rapid control of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in people with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical state taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ utely therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the features of the drug on A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ins is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ line disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ ery and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS include high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and abnormal heart rhythm disorders ) .
poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly in relation to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia as a result of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that after the sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) were used as one @-@ time intra@@ muscular one and simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ zers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before starting the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that after all@@ usion of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant major improvements of agi@@ lity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from the bas@@ eline on the PA@@ N@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score with the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agi@@ lity , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who adher@@ ed to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including PA@@ N@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stable patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) significantly reduced the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which were partially based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum levels , adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection by 90 % after receiving the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies involving healthy volunteers , the average time was applied until the maximum plasma level was reached at 1 to 3 hours .
the application of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15 - or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following IV application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human@@ oid exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated injection , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and to the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ reno@@ cor@@ tical tox@@ ici@@ ency ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ g@@ atives of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or between 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after doses that led to positions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of whom had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine earlier .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in any gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel medicines .
looking at only those who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to worsen@@ ing disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
it may also not be used in patients who have a low blood circulation in the blood or in the beginning of treatment .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel as conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects in contrast to other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel medicines .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment is to be inter@@ rupt until an improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there are no studies with patients with impaired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , which could have significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel again .
in the patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a si@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardi@@ al occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rhe@@ a occur in the patients , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women of child@@ bearing age who do not have an effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised about a sperm con@@ served prior to the treatment because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect the transport capacity and the ability to operate machines .
listed below are the most frequent and most important incidents of side effects reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most remarkable important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects listed in connection with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies are listed ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally , increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , tooth@@ ed g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in the skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estim@@ ations of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is an an@@ tim@@ ec@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli agent that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules through inhi@@ bition of their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a inhi@@ bition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular mesh , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endotheli@@ al cells and within the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel through the endotheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ate receptor , and because of the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , a pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two one @-@ armed un@@ blin@@ ded trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel 175 mg / m2 than 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ating ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metastatic as@@ hi@@ es .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for precip@@ itation on bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the mode of active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After IV dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular re@@ distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel following intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
the clearing of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dose than after a solvent @-@ based pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and to two smaller metaboli@@ tes ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ a separation was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metaboli@@ tes 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
however , only a few data are available to patients over the age of 75 , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light @-@ light protected by 8 hours .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogenic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe after a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane per@@ fusion bottle .
after complete en@@ core the solution should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid material .
then the water bottle should be swi@@ vel@@ ed slowly and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes until a complete reset of the powder is carried out .
in case of precip@@ itations or sin@@ ks visible , the pass filter must be inver@@ ted gently in order to achieve a full reset before application .

member states must ensure that the holder of authorization for the placing of the market before the market launch provides medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , label and packaging material . • A clear illustration of the correct use of the product .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which there may be complications in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if an auto@@ immune system is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml may be expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be monitored prior to the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells , thereby reducing the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
when administered as an injection into a vein in a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference medicines .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either amed to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ les@@ amed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients being amed to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
stre@@ amed pad may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
amed amed as inj@@ ections under the skin , it is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the Medic@@ ines Agency showed that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that has produced Ab@@ se@@ amed is providing information packages to the medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
August 2007 the European Commission issued a permit to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the placing of stre@@ amed amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction in patients with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of a trans@@ fusion exists due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the onset of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned major surgical interventions which require large blood volume compensation ( 4 or more units blood in men ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of external blood Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in adults without iron deficiency before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , where there is a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may be applied which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration ranges between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
an@@ emia symptoms and results may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and subsequent releases may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for controlling the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the particle number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l relative to the initial value , the dose should be maintained at 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .

patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , where the initial storage of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg of body weight should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - to make large iron reserves available before the start of the abor@@ tion therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg in each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug to the circulation .
patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ plac@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not be stre@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ embo@@ lis@@ m ) .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ort or underlying disease ; severe coron@@ ary heart disease , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently returned heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the appearance of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden drop in function , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the nutritional value should be determined and the usual causes for failure ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ escence intoxic@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the nutritional value is low , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ te index ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason of an effect is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row to diagnose a PR@@ CA are considered .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for controlling the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ denti@@ al coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis is not accelerated by the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in the case of tumour patients receiving chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ y@@ related an@@ a@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the use of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing involving the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are provided for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the start of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ cs should receive appropriate thro@@ mbo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that an increased risk for post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can occur when treating epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting point of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro experiments on tumor tissues , there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in regard to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients suffering from ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically @-@ derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and is identical with the endo@@ genous human@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulated the ery@@ thropo@@ genesis and does not affect the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression @-@ progression were examined in five major controlled trials involving 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patient .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an untreated , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate compared to controls with an@@ a@@ emia due to various more frequent malign@@ ancies .
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and satisfactory controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ embo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival can not be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after SC injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels following IV injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are ordained 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .

thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis and 146 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients suffering from ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ ost@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ ome , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ stom@@ osis ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal cancers and 30 more ) .
149 In animal experimental studies with approximately 20 times the weekly recommended weekly dose of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa induced a decrease in the mental body weight , a delay in the os@@ ci@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store bot@@ tled once for a period of a maximum of 3 days outside the fridge and not over 25 ° C .
prior to the market introduction and in accordance with agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of the marketing authorization has to provide medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , label and packaging material .
the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the filing order is set up and working before the medicine is transferred to the market and as long as the medicine applied in the traffic is applied .
the owner of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) specified in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan is oblig@@ ated to implement the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , as well as in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the Risk Management Plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ del@@ ine on risk management system for human use .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • receiving new information that may have an impact on current safety specification , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or measures to reduce risk • within 60 days of reaching an important ( drug vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) mile@@ stones • upon request by the E@@ MEA
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment , • If you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis in the veins ( deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) - if , for example , such a drop of blood has occurred .
you suffer from severe blood circulation disorders ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the carot@@ id ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you recently suffered from a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it is possible to rise within the normal range to a light dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which will be reg@@ ressed during further treatment .
your doctor will perform regular blood tests if necessary , in order to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of the treatment .
iron deficiency , dissolution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be considered and treated prior to the start of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
very rarely was reported on the appearance of ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ p@@ en@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with ab@@ ro@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is treated best .
hence , stre@@ amed injection must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death can be increased .
in case of heigh@@ tened or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider stopping the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically apparent coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of blood gener@@ osity with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ offering and the desired effect should be considered for evaluating the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your bot@@ tled dose to keep the risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully over the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurred ( e.g. a deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary embo@@ lis@@ m ) .
in case you are cancer patients , remember that stre@@ amed like a growth factor for blood cells , and under certain circumstances , the tumour may have a negative effect on the tumour .
if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , you should study the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before the start of treatment and treat them accordingly .
if your levels of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive ab@@ ro@@ amed as there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after the surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medications or have been taken / used recently , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange peri@@ odic blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works properly and does not exceed your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of stre@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange peri@@ odic blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and to ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg can be given in 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of operation and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure yourself ab@@ ro@@ amed yourself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , thro@@ mbo@@ sis , thro@@ mbo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment .
ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( quin@@ ine o@@ ede@@ ma ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special care when applying Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can come - regardless of the treatment with ab@@ ro@@ amed - to a blood c@@ lot formation ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with increased risk of bleeding after surgery ( post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) when your initial po@@ th@@ ole is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or if you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or disc@@ arded .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones brit@@ tle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered a trau@@ matic her@@ me@@ tic frac@@ ture such as failure ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125 000 IE ) prior to first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
the first study included nearly 8@@ ,000 older women with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied for a period of up to five years .
in two studies , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies involving 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
in comparison to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis candidates ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ inc@@ are are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( the death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides clari@@ fication material for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis , which contains indications of how the medicine is used , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated whenever they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit to transport Ac@@ la@@ sta throughout the European Union .

treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic acet@@ ate frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Ad@@ ditional indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of appropriate supply of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms of serious side effects • When on medical or nursing assistance is resor@@ ted
treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic acet@@ ate frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic acet@@ ate frac@@ ture , the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the patho@@ gen Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic acet@@ ate frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion is recommended .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents in Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data on safety and efficacy are lacking .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
before starting the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta , an existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia should be treated with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry .
for patients who need dental interventions , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse events reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the O@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was comparable between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , random ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which expressed itself as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were in a clinical study of o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years comparable to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received supple@@ mental amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis study , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recently taken hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion location , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area Occ@@ ur@@ ally , especially in cancer patients , about o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid , were treated .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental practices .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the jaw area of a patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and placebo .
in the event of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by the addition of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density protein ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the lower lid ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ rate frac@@ ture .
effects on the morph@@ ometric cell frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared with placebo ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on acet@@ ate frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta had an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta elevated the bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of bone density in lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire waist by 6.0 % , the lower th@@ ig@@ h by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic c@@ rest .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume compared to placebo and the maintenance of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to the bas@@ eline and was maintained at 28 % below the bas@@ eline value for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the bas@@ eline value for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the bas@@ eline value for up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all points of time .
over 24 months compared to placebo , Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % on the overall fifth and 4.3 % on the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in the clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once yearly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not subject to the monthly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate based on the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta has been studied in patients and patients over the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly mild to moder@@ ately severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal values for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to taking 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron once daily for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate was observed after 6 months .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response in 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be maintained with an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearing from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination duration t ½ g 146 hours .
the early phases of the distribution ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the quick resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration vs. time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing of substances being metaboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the C@@ olo@@ ur@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 patients .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
because of severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements can be made for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ effective intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
for studies on dogs , single doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was administered in rats by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application of accumulated expos@@ ures that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as intraven@@ ous injection points .
the most frequent occurrence in trials with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hysi@@ cal of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in doses above 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to low serum levels of calcium .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

Ris@@ ko @-@ Management @-@ Plan The owner of the licensing Agency is obliged to carry out the studies and additional activities to the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance , which are stated in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 of the application application and all the following versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ del@@ ine for risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
an edited R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which may affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • within 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA .
z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the disease of Pa@@ get .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is structured un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thereby rein@@ forces the bone again .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you are using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take other medications or have recently been taken / used , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicines that are known to harm the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta along with food and drink , you will be concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to admini@@ ster Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the hip breakdown .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions closely so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if you miss the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering the termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please consider your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms in yourself after you have obtained Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical symptoms due to low concentration of calcium in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or craw@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or inc@@ urable wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates for other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage period and conditions up to the application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic acet@@ ate frac@@ ture , acet@@ ate in@@ fusion is recommended to perform two or more weeks following the surgical treatment of hip frac@@ ture .
before and after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with fluids ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic treatment .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone conversion , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic @-@ current , hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently acquired low @-@ trau@@ matic acet@@ ate frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended .

in addition , four studies have been conducted to over 7@@ ,000 patients , in which compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for the setting of smoking compared to placebo .
the studies on the setting of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of compli@@ a on this area was difficult to assess .
the most common side effects of compli@@ a found during trials ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and may result in a small minority of patients su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts .
caution is advised with concur@@ rent use of compli@@ a with medicines such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( remedy against fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for applying HIV infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age on the lack of data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
La depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant must not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients who - apart from obesity - have no identi@@ fiable risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other related individuals are indicated that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The effectiveness and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown enough .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant . l@@ n

5.3 Quality clinical data for the safety of the following unwanted effects that were not observed in clinical studies , but which occurred in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic field , were evaluated as potentially relevant for clinical use :
in some cases , however , not in all cases , the onset of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with the animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no adverse effects were observed on fertility or cycle disorders .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats to pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation did not cause changes in learning behavior or memory .

a summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in , it can also be applied to patients ( especially overweight patients ) that can not be adjusted satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; the dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utili@@ sed and the blood sugar level decreases and type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional dose of ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ de in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who took placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ i@@ es@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
ac@@ tos must not be used in patients who may react sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ( high level of ket@@ one - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in , Ac@@ tos will serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in for patients whose met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is in@@ appropriate for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the application of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac safety .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ flow study with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in the reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated initial liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , e.g. un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , over@@ lying problems , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values are to be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone should be conducted by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are present .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can lead to fat deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution a slight reduction of mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ o@@ cr@@ on ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on as oral bi@@ directional or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ de or dual combination therapy with insulin have the risk of high dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ genes , including pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , a occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is not clear whether there is a direct correlation between taking pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological clari@@ fication should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or if this occurs , the treatment is to be suspended ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on interaction have shown that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ duc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone dimin@@ ishes the blood insulin resistance of the mother animal during pregnancy and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic rate for fet@@ al growth .
very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from present data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tumor and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , AL@@ T asc@@ ents exceeded the three times the upper limit of the normal range as frequently as placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ ular disease , the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone was 1.6 % higher than placebo when pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone bz@@ w .
since the market launch , heart failure has rarely been reported under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , but more often when pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
in summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medication .
over a period of 3.5 years in Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms appeared .
Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , which in the animal model results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it was shown that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone reduced glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose utilisation in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the onset of therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone at 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of the three @-@ month optimization phase were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone was observed .
in clinical studies over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ a showed in pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels and a slight , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol level were observed in most clinical trials .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone reduced total plastic matri@@ ces and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on whereas values decreased under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d .
in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on did not only reduce the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , but also improved the post @-@ den@@ ounced increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ flow study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised to either pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral use , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is quickly resor@@ bed , whereby the peak concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equal to triple the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal mark@@ edly .
in interaction studies , it has been demonstrated that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in humans , the marker was found mainly in the F@@ ä@@ xes ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active metaboli@@ tes are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and its metaboli@@ tes are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and re@@ versi@@ bly ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone , the blood insulin resistance in the gest@@ ation dimin@@ ishes and increases the insulin resistance of the mother animal and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic rate for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) the rat induc@@ es increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epitheli@@ um .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ de indi@@ cons led to an increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were investigated .
in clinical studies over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ a showed in pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone compared to the initial values .
in a 20 @-@ week study , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone did not only reduce the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , but also improved the post @-@ den@@ ounced increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this has an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study failed to identify the primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ mort@@ al m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary ar@@ tery syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was diagnosed with 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were lowered as much as with another insulin analog .
acet@@ one should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin regul@@ ators ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may also be adapted if administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar ( see the complete list of supplements ) .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes have out@@ weighs the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company a permit to transport Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane throughout the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice a day if a fast initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
for example , patients whose blood sugar has improved significantly by an intensive insulin therapy can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin analog or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to acet@@ one in the patient , this can be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after changing animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin .
before travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account any possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines they have taken .
4 Un@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and am@@ ni@@ otic death in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ ur@@ ally - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort known as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 An intensive improvement of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar regulation can , however , be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
skin and sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue diseases - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection site , li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may arise when it has been missed to change the plac@@ ements within the injection area .
general disorders and complaints at the administration site Occ@@ ur@@ ally - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) .
disorders of the immune system Occ@@ ur@@ ally - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ ot@@ onic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and f@@ ain@@ ting / un@@ consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can , however , develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an assigned aid or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum working maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with a faster or delayed absorption .
a series of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the metaboli@@ tes formed by the division are active .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated injection , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow any particular hazard to humans .
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane water bottle has been removed from the refrigerator - to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ cated in accordance with the instructions for the first use .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after changing animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin .
the doctor must therefore take into account any possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines they have taken .

pay attention to those below 5 Which side effects are possible ? described symptoms of an allergy ► if you feel first signs of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( symptoms of under@@ feeding ) .
if your doctor has caused a change from one type of insulin or brand to another , you may need to adjust the dose to your doctor .
► Veri@@ fy the label , whether it is the correct type of insulin , or specify the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on .
if this is not completely intact , if you get the pier@@ cing bottle , give the pass bottle to your pharmacy ( see 6 How is Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane to be stored ? ) ► if it is not even white and clou@@ dy after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing .
use the injection technique recommended by your doctor or your diabe@@ tic advis@@ er ► L@@ assen the injection needle under your skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the full dose has been inj@@ ected .
the warning signs of under@@ feeding can occur suddenly and can be : cold sweat , cold pale skin , headache , heart rate , nausea , great hunger , temporary visual disturbances , di@@ zz@@ iness , unusual ti@@ redness and weakness , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ bling , anxiety , confusion , concentration difficulties .
tell your relatives , friends and close colleagues that they bring you into the stable lateral position in case of un@@ consciousness and have to communicate immediately to a doctor .
you may not eat or drink anything , as you might suff@@ oc@@ ate it . ► If a serious under@@ feeding is not treated , this can lead to ( temporary or permanent ) brain damage or even death ► If you have an under@@ feeding with un@@ consciousness or if you suffer from frequently occurring under@@ feeding , look for your doctor .
you can regain awareness faster if the hormone glu@@ c@@ agon is inj@@ ected by a person familiar with its gift .
this can happen : • if you are inj@@ ecting too much insulin • if you eat too little or leave a meal , if you are more than otherwise physically demanding .
increased urge to ur@@ inate , thirst , loss of appetite , nausea or vom@@ iting , di@@ zz@@ iness or ti@@ redness , irrit@@ ated dry skin , dry mouth and fruity ( after acet@@ one ) ri@@ cher breathing .
• You have forgotten an insulin injection • repeated inj@@ ecting of less insulin than you need • an infection or fever • more food than usual • less physical exercise than usual .
if you often have an injection at the same place , the sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue may shrink ( li@@ po@@ hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e ) .
if you notice any depres@@ sions or thick@@ ening of your skin at the injection site , tell your doctor or your diabe@@ tic advis@@ er about it because these reactions can wor@@ sen or affect your insulin &apos;s absorption when inj@@ ected into such a location .
immediately seek a doctor if the symptoms of allergy may spread to other parts of the body , or if you suddenly feel uncomfortable and you have di@@ zz@@ iness , difficulty breathing , heart rate , you are di@@ zzy or you have the impression of becoming unconscious .
you may have a very rare severe allergic reaction to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane or one of its components ( a so @-@ called systemic allergic reaction ) .
if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor , your diabetes couns@@ ellor or your pharmac@@ ist .

this document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
the highly effective ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced with the procedure of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : e @-@ mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu © E@@ MEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged How was Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id studied ?
ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may also be adapted if administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company a permit to transport Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id across the European Union .
if two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin produced quickly has to be absorbed first , then the amount of long @-@ acting insulin .
3 . when changing to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient a dose adjustment is necessary , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the administration site Occ@@ ur@@ ally - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an assigned aid or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical study in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients undergoing major surgical procedures showed that a 42 % decrease in mortality was reduced by 42 % ( 8 % vs. 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the peak is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration of the activity is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was examined at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) of diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0.@@ 05 I.@@ E. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ E. / ml insulin in the in@@ fusion fluids 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D@@ - glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable for 24 hours at room temperature .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of crystal de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or g@@ out no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; ) , which can lead to joint and bone damage .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per deci@@ liter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur , so it is recommended that patients take more medicines to prevent rheum@@ atic attacks at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( hypo@@ der@@ mic ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose levels of ur@@ ic acid in the blood was below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily took 120 m@@ g. a ur@@ ic acid in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
this was compared with 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver function .
in particular in patients with heart complaints in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also pose a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to deposits ( including one of the well @-@ known or current g@@ out ties and / or rheum@@ atic arthritis ) .
if the serum resin seal is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
for patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated so far ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended for children and young people .

liver disease Dur@@ ing Phase 3 clinical studies slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis procedure and , depending on clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine zinc was not conducted in@@ effective studies on f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhi@@ bition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine level ( a inhi@@ bition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous administration of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .

7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ - treatment groups in total more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data occasionally .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( A@@ PE@@ X Study and F@@ ACT trial as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were identified .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value at study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the A@@ PE@@ X study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and Fig@@ ure 1 ) as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional doses of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT @-@ study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the regular dose of al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum incre@@ ment ( 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were sum@@ mar@@ ised for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the lowering of the serum resin table to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ as &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restrictions The A@@ PE@@ X study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney dys@@ functions ( D ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum concentrations in subjects , regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum resin concentrations of ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( bas@@ eline ) had a serum di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data from phase 3 , which was collected in two years , showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels of &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheum@@ atism , so less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against g@@ out in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients had no treatment against g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the gou@@ ge size , resulting in 54 % of patients with a complete breakdown of the plaster grades up to 24 months .
increased T@@ SH@@ E values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also received in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses are dose @-@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage drop in serum resin concentrations was observed , as long as this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent sto@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l , after doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ en showed that these oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ altered F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion via the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the stool was found as un@@ altered F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ ide of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 7 % ) .
after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function .

carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility in male rats was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin @-@ stones in the highly @-@ dose treated group , about 11 @-@ times exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ isation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was noted that f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 4.3 times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity mat@@ ured , which was accompanied by a reduction in breeding performance and a development delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , which approximately 4,@@ 3 times and with trained rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , who were approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not reveal any ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

21 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were identified .
the data from phase 3 , which was collected in two years , showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels of &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheum@@ atism , so less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against g@@ out in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients had no treatment against g@@ out ) .

in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can achieve concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble .
if you keep the ur@@ inary acid concentration low through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the crystal formation will be prevented and in this way a reduction in the discomfort is achieved .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine if you have a heart failure or have any other heart problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ inary acid concentration as a result of a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) .
if you have a rheum@@ atic attack at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , heat and joint swelling ) , wait until the attack is dropped before starting the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
this does not have to be with everyone , but could also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
your doctor will also prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary , in order to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are brit@@ tle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medications ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals approved in the European Union , the Company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of boo@@ sting vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed for preventing bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( difficulty swal@@ lowing ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as acid colli@@ sions .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it may not be used in o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us diseases , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. for approval for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white until frac@@ tured white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following indications are to follow exactly in order to reduce the risk of irrit@@ ated irrit@@ ations and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract besides p@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty are only given under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ra@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partly these were severe and required a hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end the medicine after symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe eye @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cers , among them some severe and associated with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , typically associated with a tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men administered mainly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available that indicate whether bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ atal care in patients who need a jaw @-@ surgical procedure reduce the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the treating physician is author@@ itative for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet in the next morning if they are unable to take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the scheduled weekly day .
other diseases that affect mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurring .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy nor by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports were reported by cancer patients , but also was reported in o@@ steopor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , absorption of serum levels of &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate following an oral over@@ dose may cause hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ gen to Vitamin D@@ 3 .
the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ gen D@@ 3 is the increase in the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum levels , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption .
in severe cases , a deficiency of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and o@@ ste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ia can lead to increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in o@@ steopor@@ osis .

after 15 weeks of treatment , the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ E. ) significantly reduced the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) .
studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) were demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies the average an@@ tig@@ mati@@ sm of the BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years was 8.@@ 8 % at the verteb@@ ral column , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % on the trou@@ gh .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % versus placebo ( 6.2 % ) compared to placebo was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D were continued by the spinal column and the tro@@ chan@@ ter ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily continued to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the appearance of at least one new verteb@@ rate frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption of an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean or@@ ale bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fast and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
the bio@@ availability decreased to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in o@@ steopor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first eating or drinking of the day .
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue following IV administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C all@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences .
following the intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and systemic clearing was not exceeded 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .
resor@@ ption Of healthy adult volunteers ( women and men ) after the administration of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after night fast and two hours before taking a meal , mean area under the serum concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D@@ 3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( without taking into account endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 levels ) .
the mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D@@ 3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an period until reaching the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
biot@@ rans@@ formation Vitamin D@@ 3 is rapidly metaboli@@ zed in the liver with 25 hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ine D@@ 3 and then metaboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ gen D@@ 3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy subjects was the mean elimination of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the f@@ ences after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the portion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although no clinical data is available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a somewhat elevated accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate non @-@ clinical data based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , chronic toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential do not reveal any special dangers for humans .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted to a kidney or liver to prevent transplan@@ ted organ transplan@@ t from the immune system .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , with the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after one year ( for example , examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of the di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were performed and investigated how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any other ingredients may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken concur@@ r@@ ently with advance , as the Adv@@ ancement dose or the dose of the concur@@ r@@ ently taken medication may be adjusted accordingly .

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level provisions ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; )
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ levels should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks of transplan@@ ting under Adv@@ ag@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate night ran@@ splan@@ tation period .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the advance dose can take several days until the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application For suppression of transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
dose recommendations - kidney transplantation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ ancement therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
further dose adjustments can be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ ancement therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted to a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion has to take place in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ ent once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initi@@ al@@ dose recommended in ren@@ al and liver transplan@@ t must commen@@ ce for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are converted to law , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there are no clinical experience with lawyer in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ectal patients , was used in a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , for transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in specific patient groups Pati@@ ents with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the desired area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Since ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum levels of serum , a calculation of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ lear@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.5 ) when switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of full blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ k@@ level inspections .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ levels during the first two weeks of transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled following conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ent , dose adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or concur@@ rent application of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments on the dose may require several days until the steady state has entered .
clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in full blood usually lie in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and adren@@ al - and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t receivers , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has resulted in serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur in the wake of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over @-@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ t rejection , which proved to be therapeu@@ tical opposite other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
for proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ cul@@ ature in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies during treatment with adv@@ enti@@ a ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly thorough monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , since the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , a corneal or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e described as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was to be observed , which can therefore occur under law .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ loading and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor .
if patients taking tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ ag@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ arded , lac@@ tose , special caution is required in patients with the rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels concur@@ r@@ ently with substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with anti@@ fung@@ al antibiotics such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the macro@@ li@@ de antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the inhi@@ bition of gastro@@ intestinal metaboli@@ zation .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be metaboli@@ zed with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism is affecting .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus down the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone level , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially decrease the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and Phen@@ ac@@ on and extend their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy is reported under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of a premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ alkal@@ ine of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :

due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ u@@ bility and high retention of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ zed .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On a molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oly protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular memory .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um @-@ dependent inhi@@ bition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thereby preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain set of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic genes .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for higher clearance rates observed after transplantation .

Adv@@ ent is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital heart defect caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Adv@@ ent is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ent is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is produced differently , so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the drug was used to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ents in preventing ble@@ ed@@ ings in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new ble@@ ed@@ ings with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ent ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II .
it may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit to transport Adv@@ ent across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , after the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ U. / dl ) .
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger for the patient is over .
during the treatment course , an appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections to be administered .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , varying in vi@@ vo recovery and having different half @-@ value periods .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis The long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an adequate dose , a test must be performed to verify an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ory values , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the rate of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the Factor VI@@ II , where the risk within the first 20 ex@@ posi@@ tional stages is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure @-@ days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ory development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there is no experience of the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s associated with the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients showing a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ mirror was performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate again showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 145 children and adults 2 with severe moderate to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) were detected by a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study were 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ tres against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels versus anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but there were no signs or symptoms pointing to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE was reported on hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ sis reactions ( frequency unknown ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a factor factor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 100 previously treated patients , or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the first approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the value @-@ risk assessment as a positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE , which requires a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited granted approval to the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for the promotion of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infection in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumour and thus enable the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient who joined Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer in the field of under@@ growth , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP will compile a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in Inj@@ ection in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore offers benefits for patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful nor harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company has not informed the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered mode of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly releases over several hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( blocked nose ) , are canc@@ eled .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effects were the changes in the sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all ha@@ y@@ fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common adverse events of a@@ ero ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ ot@@ oric hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , anor@@ ex@@ ia ( lack of appetite ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from severe angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension ( hyper@@ ton@@ ia ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) or a ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( stroke ) or a risk for a ha@@ em@@ or@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for the introduction of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , cr@@ ushing or ch@@ ew ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms dimin@@ ish .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , as long @-@ term utilisation can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after a decrease in the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Er@@ got@@ amin , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ g@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ gest@@ ational medicines called phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data is not sufficient to express appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of a@@ ero @-@ a@@ ze were not examined in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to express appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment in case of hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or ampli@@ fication of the headache ) must be removed .
in the treatment of following patient groups , caution is advised : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder hal@@ ting or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is recommended for at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can otherwise prevent positive reactions to skin reactions or reduce their size .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were dos@@ ed in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and those treated with placebo , regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metaboli@@ sm of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a substrate is nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to frequency in the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , a@@ ero @-@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .
headache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated Mik@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , euph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , transp@@ ir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ ral pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the inhi@@ bition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P sel@@ ec@@ tin to endotheli@@ al cells .
at a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg no influence on standard measurement variables of flight rates including ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was detected .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ athetic effects , such as increasing blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged 12 to 78 years of age took part with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city adher@@ ence .
as part of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of plasma .
after the per@@ or@@ ative application of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the floating equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that 4 subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly metaboli@@ sed .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was exposed to exposure of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
however , based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated injection , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the regulatory submission , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , ongoing or it@@ chy nose and drow@@ ning or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

if you are taking medicines with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
the use in the recommended dosage is not to be reck@@ oned with , that a@@ ero leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take a dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves rash and swelling ) or skin rash .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sleep disorders , muscle aches , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of liver inflammation and over cases of eye @-@ catching liver cells was also rarely reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg and 5 mg of fusion tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged 1 @-@ 5 , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or milk .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by identifying the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the no@@ od@@ les , difficulty of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for inser@@ ting and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom @-@ scores ( symptom @-@ scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decrease in symptoms after six weeks with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % was compared with placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis @-@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the whole European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the hypo@@ aller@@ genic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the current disease process and may be termin@@ ated after the symptoms dimin@@ ish and be resum@@ ed during their recur@@ rence .
in case of persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended permanent treatment during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets which were given in addition to ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
a clinical pharmac@@ ological study did not increase the performance of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) concur@@ r@@ ently with A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machines .
clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most commonly reported side effects reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was headache . this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of those treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , at which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhi@@ bition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P sel@@ ec@@ tin to endotheli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses at which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered for over 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg daily .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg no influence on standard measurement variables of flight rates including ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be classified depending on the duration of symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
as shown on the overall score for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of ae@@ ti@@ ology , is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since the history of hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n also leads to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of no@@ od@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study comparing patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulative after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a substrate is nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated injection , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that no data available to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
for about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is metaboli@@ zed and experienced higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normally .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ lac@@ tose @-@ absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , concur@@ rent A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as with the placebo group .
clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study in adults and adolescents , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dis@@ sem@@ ination dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
in a single dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psych@@ om@@ otor impair@@ ment .
in adult clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological studies , there was no increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol , neither to ampli@@ fication of alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of no@@ od@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger with bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are impaired .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant substance @-@ accumulation after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , O@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those recommended by adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out .

immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the di@@ lap@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile specified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed processed tablet as a bio@@ equivalent to the ap@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the ap@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat for the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

the spread of this poorly metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normally .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ lac@@ tose @-@ absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the placebo group .
children aged between 6 and 23 months were the most commonly reported side effects reported more frequently than placebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution , no side effects were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years of age .
the recommended doses were comparable to the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. formally announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company withdraw@@ s its application for authorization to prevent avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used for adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that is intended to protect from a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane envelope of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognis@@ es the human body as alien ) , was puri@@ fied , puri@@ fied and used as part of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for prec@@ imp@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are interested in a clinical trial and need further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
for further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , ap@@ pre@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined the anti@@ viral drugs used by the patient , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus will respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which is taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is calculated according to body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood when combined with other anti@@ viral drugs and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS cannot cure , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 infected adults who had not previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in 20@@ 6 adults who had taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors at 20@@ 6 adults with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few to respond to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drugs A@@ gener@@ ase strengthened the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it was associated with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or pharmaceuticals , which are removed as well as a@@ generations and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase have the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors over four years compared the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic enh@@ ancer Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as only limited information was available for scientific reasons at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase across the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 . if A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing additive of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ says ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be prescribed cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction ; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ o@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal manifest@@ ations including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of as@@ says with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ ubar@@ b oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the substance concentrations are available .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ in content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us .
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy drugs needed to be associated with the development of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B . higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis .
infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms at the time of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ o@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with pharmaceuticals , whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ zed predominantly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in an attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already uses St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , whereas C@@ MA@@ x de@@ grades 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a tight monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical study to apply A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the attach@@ able component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dose adjustment is required in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is low .
the effects of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may lower the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , be careful as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ on could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
when these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ on is difficult .
the simultaneous application of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ ver@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with Ri@@ ver@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will fall to at least half the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin did not have been performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concur@@ rent administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole in comparison to the value observed after 200 mg of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may possibly result in interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions linked to these medicines if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as a@@ gener@@ ase as it can lead to erectile dysfunction .
simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as an enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
concur@@ rent use with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual impair@@ ment and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal manifest@@ ations ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to increase plasma levels at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase is administered .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors may lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ ubar@@ b oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
a more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous injection of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase should not be applied together with Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am taken or@@ ally ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same time it is advisable to use par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma levels by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is given at the moment to adjust the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with concur@@ rent administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( such as Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended concur@@ rent as@@ A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefit for the mother compared to possible risks to the fet@@ us .
in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of vi@@ le rats , which was administered by the inc@@ iner@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding period of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occ@@ uring early on and rarely led to the onset of treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used at the same time as HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as subsequent laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and facial fat tissue , increased intra@@ ab@@ domin@@ als and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral individuals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ching ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be abor@@ ted .
cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those observed under sole as@@ gener@@ ase treatment ; one exception was increases of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K values , which were observed in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed for signs of intoxic@@ ation@@ . ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures must be initiated .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ ter@@ ines with the result of formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti @-@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhi@@ bition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved fossi@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istic failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 study and its pro@@ long@@ ation AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred over 96 weeks following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic assessment systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( isol@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic samples associated with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r , however , remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral patients in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) appear .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early canc@@ elling of a failing treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can have a detri@@ mental impact on subsequent treatment .
evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which PI pre@@ treated adults with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istic failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ slip threshold of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 @-@ 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was tested twice a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg two times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) versus the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation in treating with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , on the other hand , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal causes a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was imp@@ acted by food intake , although the simultaneous dietary intake affects the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient varies during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the c@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines which indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure , as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase &apos;s solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ or@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , so the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ omas appeared in male animals that correspon@@ ded to the 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - x ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet cleared and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence for the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and for the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes were neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this h@@ ep@@ atic toxic@@ ity can be monitored and tested in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gen@@ ase nor after the treatment has been treated .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rabbit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to human therapeutic dosage , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus g@@ ong@@ ation and slight skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development .
24 . if A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing additive of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ says ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be prescribed cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with weak or light liver dysfunction ; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the substance concentrations are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in the duration of 27 when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , whereas C@@ MA@@ x de@@ grades 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a tight monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is low .
when these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ on is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will fall to at least half the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study where rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with concur@@ rent administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ her@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefit for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the inc@@ iner@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the breast@@ feeding period of Am@@ bla@@ avi@@ r , showed a decreased weight of the body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to be observed for signs of intoxic@@ ation@@ . ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures must be initiated .
the anti @-@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation in treating with PI pre@@ treated children .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient varies during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the c@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines which indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ omas appeared in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - x ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice a daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence for the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application .

studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metaboli@@ sation routes are not yet fully mature , so am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .

the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ GM solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gen@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ in content , A@@ gen@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
concur@@ rent administration may result in a competitive inhi@@ bition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .

the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , with which the patients were treated for six weeks or carried out al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumours after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies involving a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in over 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immuno@@ competent adults if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
( Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is to continue until all visible war@@ ts in the genital or peri@@ anal area have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions were completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in a thin layer and rub in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is fully absorbed .
these patients should weigh between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with the possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should be a balancing act between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily auth@@ oring was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a tendency to circumc@@ ision were observed .
in case of an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in higher than the recommended doses an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experiences are available for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ al cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applic@@ ators for the treatment of external sei@@ zur@@ es in the genital and peri@@ anal region .
limited data indicate an increased rate of current reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown less efficacy in this group of patients regarding the elimination of the war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed following the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment has been treated .
since no data on long @-@ term treatment rates of more than 36 months after treatment are available , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in the case of super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
clinical experience is not recommended in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the use of previously untreated melan@@ oma is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is less likel@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not examined for treating ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or in the ears or on the lip area within the lip area .
very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis at anatom@@ ical points outside of the face and scal@@ p are available .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this use , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity in the course of therapy or go back after setting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 ac@@ ne les@@ ions showed a lower full recovery rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) have not been quanti@@ fied either after a unique or repeated topical application , no recommendation for use during breast@@ feeding can be given .
the most commonly shared and considered prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effects in studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions to the site of the treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the most frequently reported and considered prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects include discomfort at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ al @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common adverse effects in these studies were a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) in these studies ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the side effects identified by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
according to the investig@@ ational plan , the clinical signs indicated that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / abor@@ tion / abor@@ tion ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the investig@@ ational plan , evaluating the clinical signs indicated that in these studies five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream was very common with severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe snor@@ ing and tasting ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials for the treatment of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was noted with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area .
the inad@@ vert@@ ent oral intake of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , may lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically significant side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were demonstrated in the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 phase @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that the efficacy in relation to complete eradic@@ ation of the war@@ ts during I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo @-@ treatment is clearly superior .
in 60 % of the total 119 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine the war@@ ts were completely healed ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who had placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved in 23 % of 15@@ 7 male patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in five times per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were cured and stayed for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ ne les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ eas@@ iness of scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical radiation after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , and super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials for children aged 2 @-@ 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages investigated there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest medication concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bed 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was low after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; another four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal application revealed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with der@@ mal administration of three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application area .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine only has a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for the human being is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the agent @-@ free cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it may harm other people , even if they have the same symptoms as you do . − If one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
● fig war@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) , which have formed on the skin in the gen@@ itali@@ a and anus ( anus ) area , is a frequently encountered , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body .
if left untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - so early detection and treatment is important .
ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are rough areas of the skin that occur in humans who have been exposed to a lot of sunlight during their lifetime .
al@@ dar@@ a should only be used in case of flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that al@@ dar@@ a is the most appropriate treatment for you .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or the virus responsible for the infection .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for drug replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung capacity , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out at a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ation devices , and patients may require appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study focused primarily on the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect regarding reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal sized liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of more than five ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very common side effects in patients under the age of five include increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known each year and where necessary to update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit to transport Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to the entire European Union .
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ is@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been established , and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been established , and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ conditional reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in an appropriate clinical setting where re@@ vit@@ alization facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously investigated .
treat 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medicines ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ ka ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion , the treatment should be considered with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction , the in@@ fusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response has occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ enz with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy that include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data is available to new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were primarily reported as in@@ fusion @-@ related responses , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in relation to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , short@@ ness of breath and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mostly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients received a Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a severe exp@@ ir@@ ation mostly within one month to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or until early ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) , there were no investig@@ ational antibodies ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients with which it was never seen as ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with lack of antibody levels had a robust reduction of G@@ AG &apos;s level in urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected in patients with high antibody ti@@ tres .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of un@@ desirable drug reactions , even if the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasoning for the enzyme therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulating sub @-@ str@@ ata and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate restoration of the enzyme activity .
following IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ sis , most likely to have glucose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary efficacy end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute enclosure .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms each week for another 3,5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the en@@ vi@@ ability presented in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as derived from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear tr@@ ash of the G@@ AG @-@ mirrors in the urine ( µ@@ g / m@@ g. of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients who were considered clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute walking test , range of motion of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
an open one year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe exp@@ iry form and 4 with the middle term ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe sequ@@ ential form showed normal mental development speed whereas the older patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation were limited or no advances in cognitive development were observed .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ ering schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirrors in urine , liver volume , and the 6 @-@ minute test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a viable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administ@@ ering and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow any particular hazard to humans .
since no case studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except the ones listed below 6.@@ 6 .

within the given period , the owner of the company &apos;s authorization has to complete the following programme of study , whose results form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk relationship .
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information to patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which cle@@ ans certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts before or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the components of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have encountered a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of dimin@@ ished Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medications or have recently taken over , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
advice on handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is provided for the intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and healthcare professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - implic@@ ated involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , short@@ ness of breath and face ede@@ ma .
very common ( incidence of more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea , abdominal pain • P@@ ain joint disorders , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ ased blood pressure • Hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the fusion site
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the package insert will be updated .

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient the number of th@@ inning teeth to be dil@@ uted .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
in patients who have not previously been treated , A@@ lim@@ ta is used as a sole therapy in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to reduce side effects , the patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( remedy against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent de@@ hydr@@ ation ) should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood picture changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be decreased .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed also s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes more easily into cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer working time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) in 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug for cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months for the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months compared to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell were treated longer than with the medi@@ ator during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
each perfor@@ ation bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the cle@@ av@@ age bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid has to be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ Gift and on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the ing@@ es@@ tion must be continued throughout the treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood picture should be produced before each application , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dose examination must take place taking into account the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding treatment cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ level 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient receives the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dos@@ ages a ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so on in the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials did not reveal that there is an increased side @-@ efficiency risk in patients aged 65 years or above over 65 years of age .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min which would exceed the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a function of a liver function of &gt; 1.5 @-@ times the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ werten of &gt; to 3.0 times the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not examined specifically in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone @-@ bone immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality count exceeds ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has again reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neutr@@ ality , plat@@ el@@ et number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 of ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia were treated if pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed need to be instructed to apply foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce the toxic@@ ity of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) have to avoid the simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ vary ( &gt; 1.3 g. daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients provided with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed have to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients with whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with a clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment should be considered .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving pellets re@@ xed in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic compound .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible deteri@@ oration of the reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment gate to obtain advice regarding the sperm con@@ served .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion resulting in increased detection of side effects .
therefore caution should be advised if in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are used in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy , should be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs is available with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ae .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ tic@@ aboli@@ c an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ tes severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , except if it is absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the onset of treatment in order to obtain advice regarding the sperm con@@ serving .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is passed into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

for this table , a threshold of 5 % was established regarding the inclusion of all events in which the report doctor held a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as possible .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and motor neu@@ rop@@ athy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC Tox@@ ic@@ ity , reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients who received random@@ ised p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
the clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to the results of three individual p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mono@@ therapies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that may be possible in connection with study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 Pati@@ ents with NSCLC , random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSCLC who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic non @-@ fol@@ ate which performs its action by interrup@@ ting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as an anti@@ fold with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cine am@@ i@@ dri@@ b@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis by thy@@ mid@@ in- and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ ds .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , easy @-@ blind stage 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin treated patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of medi@@ an 2.8 months of prolonged survival compared to those patients who were only diagnosed with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) associated with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin @-@ Arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) in the case of the case of Lun@@ am@@ genesis in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin @-@ Arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in lung function in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin @-@ Arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in Pati@@ ents with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival fell in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9,@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately controlled , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre@@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with IT@@ T population analyses and support non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination versus gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
medi@@ an PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1,@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25,@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .

the resulting solution is clear and the coloring goes from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow without compromising the quality of the sample .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they cannot metaboli@@ se some fats in the food , thereby causing around a quarter of the fats eaten with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients receiving All@@ i 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ cco finish , stu@@ ffy , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , ab@@ rupt secre@@ tions ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or breast @-@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with an easily hypo@@ kal@@ ische , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as there is not enough data on efficacy and safety .
however , as or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Pre@@ gn@@ ancy to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.6 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or a rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes may be associated with improved metabolic control , patients receiving a medicine for diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti @-@ diabe@@ tic must be adapted if necessary .
patients taking all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with concur@@ rent or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
for the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ carot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement prior to bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single dose of am@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal adverse events were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of reported side effects identified after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown size .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported after the market launch , no side effects or similar adverse events were reported from the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals , a rapid re @-@ formation of any systemic effects resulting from the li@@ pas@@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect takes place in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ i and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic elev@@ ations .
clinical trials were derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 confirm the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ische , fat @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the study course ( Table 1 ) and as part of the study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average cholesterol in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the mean change in LD@@ L cholesterol with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.4 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3,@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline score 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist circum@@ ference was 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( bas@@ eline value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabolic or@@ list@@ at were non @-@ meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , not metabolic or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be found spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients receiving a minimal invasive dose , two main metaboli@@ tes , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ cine group ) , could be identified , which represented approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated injection , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular risk for humans .
pharmaceutical @-@ vig@@ il@@ ance system The owner of the market authorization system must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application application , will be applied and works before and while the product is available on the market .

the most common side effects are related to the effect of the capsules and result in more fat being ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment , as you may not have consistently reduced the amount of fat in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize nutrition @-@ related side effects : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week , before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit is reducing your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take for each meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial dessert , as you may possibly have done with other programs for weight loss . • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Do not store the medicine for children . • Do not apply after the exp@@ iry date stated on the car@@ ton . • Do not store the container tightly to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed trays with si@@ los that serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow this . • You can carry out your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) , which is included in this pack .

obesity has an effect on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hypertension • Diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • O@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis Please contact your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious illness and has a positive effect on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you will also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at most a day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended intake of fat in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
the amount of calories that are suitable for you can be found in the information below , which is suitable for you . • Because of the effect of the capsule , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as previously , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by observing the recommended intake of fats , you can maximize weight loss while reducing the likel@@ ihood of nutritional supplements . • You should try to remove step by step and continuously .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you burn daily 150 k@@ cal every day , i.e. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For long @-@ lasting weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calories and fat targets and observe them . • Absol@@ utely meaningful is a nutritional diary with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fat tre@@ et@@ scent and give guidelines to become physically active .

al@@ oh@@ a is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are powerful trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies which are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ is was examined at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy regi@@ mens , which were severe trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with al@@ oh@@ a showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chemotherapy regi@@ mens , which are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with al@@ oh@@ a showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ e ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for the transport of Alo@@ xi@@ an across the European Union .
Alo@@ is is inde@@ xed : for preventing acute nausea and vom@@ iting in severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi@@ an for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ st@@ acy or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after inj@@ ections .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in cases where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
besides chemotherapy , Alo@@ is is not intended to be used either in the days of chemotherapy or for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not obstruc@@ t the activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single IV dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ St@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the concur@@ rent administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ duc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tral@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ a ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common side effects were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least linked to Alo@@ xi@@ am , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events occurred as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out because of the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with a alo@@ of over@@ dosing .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 m@@ g. of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life period 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double blind study 6@@ 67 patients receiving strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of trials with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ lic@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study , carried out at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers , was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations of a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are dos@@ ed propor@@ tionally in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after IV doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration in 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular cancer patients was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days achieved total tex@@ tual position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with which after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg was comparable ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ time yield of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metaboli@@ tes which , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as imm@@ utable substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous wound closure in healthy corne@@ as , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination @-@ time and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects have been observed only after expos@@ ures that are considered adequate above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance to clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indicated that p@@ alle@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can extend the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was equivalent to 30@@ x of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , pit@@ u@@ it@@ ary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and because Alo@@ e is determined in humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is considered to be low for people .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal product approved in the EU ( also known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
in a microsc@@ opic examination the liver tissue has damages and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ in amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normally increase .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to stimulate the development of the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medication to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged What were the biggest concerns that prompted CH@@ MP to say authorization for placing on the market ?
in addition , concerns have been vo@@ iced that the data on the stability of the drug and the medicine to be marketed cannot be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients responding to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
following the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease reg@@ ressed in more patients than with the reference medicines ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
in addition , the test used in the study was used to investigate the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection that is associated with crust formation ) and small infected la@@ ths ( crack or cut @-@ off ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that have been det@@ ectable or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface to be treated cannot be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection ended after the treatment ended .
139 patients ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients were treated with placebo .
in the treatment of infected wound patients , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in case of studies , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA , Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the place of application .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small hospitals , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted permission to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of raising awareness or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin int@@ ment , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection can begin .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as a patho@@ gen ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials with secondary wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area occurs after 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant inhi@@ bition in vi@@ vo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations observed in humans after topical application on sk@@ ul@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AL@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % on the skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not required if topical retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral in@@ gest@@ ing and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy , if a topical anti@@ bacterial treatment is indicated clearly and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of systemic antibiotic .
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ates or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / termin@@ ated is to weigh between the benefit of breast @-@ feeding and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side effect of irrit@@ ation at the administration site , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated from c@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhi@@ bition of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
by binding to this binding site , whi@@ st@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50 @-@ ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms appears to be alar@@ ming , consultation with experts should be sought .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to respond to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion on intact and on shiel@@ ded skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ul@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhi@@ bition .
metabolism of human liver micro@@ som@@ s in vitro oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ sm was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with small involvement of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro investigation on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymp@@ ho@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in the rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of limited fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , making up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ inn@@ ed skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , ≥ 150 mg / kg / day dose toxic@@ ity was determined at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ dose vaccine , whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immun@@ isation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be carried out in two doses .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose of hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by &quot; teach &quot; the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine , which has been approved since 1996 , and the recently admitted V@@ acc@@ ine for Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same illnesses , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix grown @-@ ups were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led 98 % to 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection location , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ability ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standar@@ dis@@ ation scheme with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses of vacc@@ ination . the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered from six to twelve months after the first dose .
if a novel vacc@@ ination is required for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured that immuno@@ competent persons who responded to a hepatitis C vacc@@ ination need a re@@ fres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory with no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 . as with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , in the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standar@@ dis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies in certain cases , so that further doses of vacc@@ ination can be needed in these cases .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in the case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ally as an exception , since it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or combined with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that there is no adequate immune response .
in a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the previous Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants ranging from 12 to 15 years old , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s tolerance was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ality on a calculation basis per doses of Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the application of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after receiving a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects receiving Ambi@@ rix had pain , 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the test persons who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the test subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to that observed after the combination of the combination @-@ vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparison study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical studies carried out at vacc@@ ines aged 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the anti @-@ HB@@ s ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose administered to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , serum rates ( SP in the table below ) versus hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study for 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds following completion of full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to those found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies was comparable 24 months after immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme to the in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time as a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ h @-@ m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing by ey@@ eg@@ lasses on possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by food containing viruses and drinks , but can also be transmitted through other ways such as bathing in waters contaminated by water .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix may not fully protect from infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccine was completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B Virus prior to administ@@ ering both doses of vacc@@ ination ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vaccine ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms that are similar to those after hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ chy r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
in case of a potential risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per doses ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected to persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened by illness or treatment in your body &apos;s own def@@ ences , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strong the response to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take additional drugs ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has received / has been vacc@@ inated or has been planned in the near future .
it may be , however , that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as many limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ines , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
typically , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
♦ s very often ( more than one drop per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated cans ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mat@@ ty • irrit@@ ability • headache - lack of appetite
♦ s often ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated cans ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( more than 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal disorders
other side effects reported that days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B very rarely ( less than 1 drop per 10,000 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) are :
these include locally limited or extended expos@@ ures that can be it@@ ching or infl@@ ated , swelling of the eye area and the face , ag@@ grav@@ ating breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 . inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you / your child considerably affects or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data that has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP acknow@@ le@@ dges that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed in transport only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure .
Ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia - divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ ia ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a sha@@ m medicine , i.e. , without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disorders or taste sensation , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor , or weight gain .
the Committee on Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia has been approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme defect already mani@@ f@@ ests in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests after the first life month ) there is an indication for use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients suffering from swal@@ lowing disorders .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk of the emergence of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not arrive immediately into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , correspon@@ d@@ ingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium but@@ yl rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and o@@ ede@@ ma .
as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate occurs over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed ri@@ pen@@ ing of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and decreased number of functional nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least one un@@ desired event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed to be associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old baby with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus nitrogen .
5 patients with ure@@ a cycle disorders can be thought to be produced for each gram taken sodium but@@ yl rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ aut , and the disease even led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of elimination of nitrogen ( sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life month ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated prior to the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients it occurred with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thine in@@ tran@@ scar@@ path@@ ia @-@ deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is known to be oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzyme with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes was also studied for intraven@@ ous injection of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in cancer patients .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , the plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were observed 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
in the majority of patients with urine retention or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in the next morning after noc@@ turn@@ al fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium but@@ y@@ rate had no compla@@ ined effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ enter@@ al or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate , correspon@@ d@@ ingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat @-@ pipes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metaboli@@ tes of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , les@@ ions were found in the pyramid &apos;s cells of the cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle it can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and a further deteri@@ oration of neuro@@ logical condition may occur in some patients .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ulate form 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion of meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring sco@@ op contains 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine by means of a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ u@@ bility of sodium but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products , which accumulate after eating proteins in the body .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine can go into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headaches , taste disorders , dimin@@ ishing the hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and a worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or hospital for an appropriate treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood picture ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ mbo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant smell of the skin , skin rash , ren@@ al dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will not be allowed to use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date following &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; User to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; User to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on same single doses or@@ ally or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al tube ( hose which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring sco@@ op of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife bank on the edge of the knife bank to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended number of measuring sco@@ ops of gran@@ ulate from the container .
angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stop up@@ lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients with a PCI undergo a higher dose and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , patients were often given a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ritu@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without G@@ PI administration - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as much as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective in all indicators as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other past@@ u@@ dine or any other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that it is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in in the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd approved for the introduction of angi@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous intake of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery will be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements the reduced in@@ fusion dose can be measured from 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
just before the procedure , a release of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a sole Bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the appearance of low ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ us dose is quickly given intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds , further surveillance is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney dys@@ functions ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second intake dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second intake dose is re@@ examined again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the administration of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous injection of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• Know@@ n hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against brain dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe ren@@ al damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
although most of the arter@@ ial punc@@ tures occur in patients with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ ona intervention ( PCI ) can perform bleeding during the treatment .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is again reached before treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggregate ) , it can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggregate or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant agents , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters can be monitored regularly .
the experimental studies are inadequate in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ questioning He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over the age of 65 were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point area , reduction of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occurring in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ tures , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose , or throat .
the following data on side @-@ effects are based on data from a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over the age of 65 were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system categories in Table 6 .
in the event of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is immediately abor@@ ted and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ al inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre as well as in the an@@ ion mining region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is present in liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part slowly re@@ stores the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with serum from patients with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggregate reaction .
in healthy volunteers and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory action which is documented by prolon@@ ging ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed on the patient , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ question@@ able He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in Arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or at the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography in 72 hours were distributed uni@@ form@@ ly over the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients undergoing surgery in 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with over 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in Table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ ona intervention ( PCI ) and patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine as pe@@ p@@ tide passes a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ utilisation of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metaboli@@ te resulting from the split@@ ting of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin resistance is very small from insulin , and the change means that it works faster and shorter working life than a short @-@ acting insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin resistance was observed after six months .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adapted if administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glucose tolerance capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin demand in patients with a restriction of liver function can be reduced .
any change in the effectiveness , the brand ( creator ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ arded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method may undergo a change in insulin demand .
3 An inadequate dosage or abor@@ tion of a treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin belonging to another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the timing of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the level of action of the used insulin and can therefore change when switching to the treatment scheme .
substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , S@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , Symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ vation can be weakened or absent .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human@@ oid in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin secre@@ tion occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not enter the breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use .
listed below are listed un@@ desirable disease treatments listed in clinical trials ( ≥ 1 / 10 ; often : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; very rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the data available ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ bling , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive dog @-@ bearing , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If it is neglected to continuously change the injection location within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1@@ mg ) , given by a correspon@@ d@@ ingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that action occurs faster in case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin sensitivity and shorter working time than in cou@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin sensitivity in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional glu@@ cos@@ ity effect , and at 0.3 mg / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ity effect , just like human insulin .
insulin release insulin has twice as quick action as normal human@@ oid and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ ity effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human@@ oid .
the data showed that at an application of insulin release 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ den@@ ounced gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with a human@@ oid normal acting insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ ounced control than was achieved with a human regular insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin supplements are turned 15 minutes after the meal begins , comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human insulin analog , which is given 2 million before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin release medication 2 minutes before the meal was started ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) before the meal was started ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human@@ oid normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin release after injection of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the meal commen@@ ces in comparison with human Nor@@ mal @-@ acting insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
