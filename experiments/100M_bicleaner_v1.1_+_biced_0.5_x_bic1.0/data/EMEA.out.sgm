<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For further information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirling thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disturbance, a psychological disorder where the patient alternates manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternating with periods of normal sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when the oral ingesting of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be applied for inserting or the melting tablets in patients that cause difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">Patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify should be adapted to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells among each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ariadprazole is believed to be a "partial Agist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Ariadprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent, acts as the neurotransmitter in order to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Ariadprazl helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that led to increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients with which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased uneasiness caused by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and absorbs the solution.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection solutions, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, significantly reduced the symptoms of increased restlessness than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the re-occurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and when it was given an additional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for insertion (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders, nausea, somnolence (dizziness), nausea, vomiting, nausea, insomnia (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I disruption and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and were able to outweigh the manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disruption if oral therapy is not suitable compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Ottaka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the transport of Abilify across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mostly had manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients with ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, even with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide using Ariadprazole compared to other antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overline disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolmia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celery and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia occurring with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in patients treated with Abilify, this should be considered to reduce the dose or to break down the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Ariadprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years of Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study of fixed doses, a significant relationship between dosage and response to undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydips, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients suffering from diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania as a result of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Ariadprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Ariadprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Ariadprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study involving healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is to be expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolizers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the joint application of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level before starting the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate rise in Aripigezol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates from CYP2D6 (dextromborphic / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (dextromborphic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation concerning safety in humans and due to the concerns arising in the reproduction studies of the animal, unless the possible benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including parsonism, acathansia, dystonia and dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazl treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Ariadprazole was 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazl treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">Unintentional or intentional acute overdosages with Ariadprazole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is useful in the treatment of overdosing, as Ariadprazl has a high plasma performance binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Ariadprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disturbance is mediated on the combination of a partial antagonistic effect on dopamine levels and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Ariadprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and for serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT7-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">Administered by Aripiprazole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks to healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and at the Putname.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 the proportion of responder patients who adhered to study medication was similar in both groups (Ariadprazzol 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- DepressionsRate Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">Ariadprazl showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return in a placebo-controlled trial for 26 weeks with chronic schizophrenia, which was 34% in the Aripiprazl group and 57% of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I defect, Aripiprazole compared placebo no superior efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, which was comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Ariadprazole also showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania in week 12, like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which were partially based on lithium or valproat monotherapy for therapeutic serum levels, adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial lasting 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization period prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bipolar return, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylization of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination duration amounts to approximately 75 hours for Ariadprazole in extensive metabolizers via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolizers via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Ariadprazl there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, nor did a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenic patients show no gender-related effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A quantitative study on pharmacokinetics revealed no clinically significant differences in respect to ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with varying liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated injection, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenocortical toxiciency (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal rinds / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the average cady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugatives of Aripiprazole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the sulfate-conjugate of Hydroxy- Aripiprazole were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study about 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages that led to expositions of 3 and 11 times the middle steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical state taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acutely therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Ariadprazole, see the summary of the features of the drug on Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Ariadprazole injection solution in patients with agility and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepins is considered necessary in addition to the Ariadprazole injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on safety and efficacy of Ariadprazole injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overline disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolmia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celery and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia occurring with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS include high fever, stiffness, changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and abnormal heart rhythm disorders).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydips, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania as a result of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that after the sole administration of Aripiprazole, in a study in which healthy volunteers aripiprazole (15 mg dosage) were used as one-time intramuscular one and simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Ariadprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolizers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose level before starting the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscularly received, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that after allusion of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazole and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Ariadprazole injection solution associated with statistically significant major improvements of agility / behavioural disorders compared with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of agility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from the baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score with the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 the proportion of responder patients who adhered to study medication was similar in both groups (Ariadprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stable patients with chronic schizophrenia, Ariadprazole (oral) significantly reduced the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which were partially based on lithium or valproat monotherapy for therapeutic serum levels, adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study extension in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization period prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bipolar return, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazole AUC is 90% larger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection by 90% after receiving the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies involving healthy volunteers, the average time was applied until the maximum plasma level was reached at 1 to 3 hours.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Ariadprazole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15 - or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity following IV application there were no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) above the maximum humanoid exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated injection, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and to the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; therefore, they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenocortical toxiciency (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equal to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugatives of Aripiprazole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or between 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits these effects were observed after doses that led to positions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three quarters of whom had received an anthracycline earlier.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in any gift or as monotherapy) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, 72 (31%) of 229 with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel medicines.</seg>
<seg id="270">Looking at only those who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to worsening disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have a low blood circulation in the blood or in the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel as conventional paclitaxel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects in contrast to other paclitaxel medicines.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited for the transport of Abraxane throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first-line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and is not indicated for a standard anthracycline-containing therapy (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophilately &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy grade 3, the treatment is to be interrupt until an improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2, and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">There are no studies with patients with impaired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is a albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which could have significantly other pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the patients no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neutrophilately increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a sidiotoxicity associated with Abraxane has not been proven, cardial occurrences in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If Abraxane nausea, vomiting and diarrhea occur in the patients, they can be treated with the usual anti-emetics and constipating agents.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used for pregnant women or women of childbearing age who do not have an effective contraception, except the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is essential.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraception method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised about a sperm conserved prior to the treatment because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often) which can affect the transport capacity and the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">Listed below are the most frequent and most important incidents of side effects reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pivotal phase III study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most remarkable important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1 the side effects listed in connection with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies are listed (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally, increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphor in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, toothed gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, neck pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal muscles, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimations of the actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimecrotubuli agent that promotes the accumulation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules through inhibition of their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular mesh, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and within the framework of in-vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminate receptor, and because of the albuminous protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine), a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two one-armed unblinded trials and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent-containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 than 3-hour infusion for prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premediating (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastatic ashies.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for precipitation on baseline based on the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The mode of active substance exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After IV dose of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the Paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates far-reaching extravascular redistribution and / or soft binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel following intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane were compared with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearing of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane dose than after a solvent-based paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urea separation was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available to patients over the age of 75, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="359">"" "this means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also known as" "" "reference medicines" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels, in which there may be complications in connection with a blood transfusion, if an autoimmune system is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml may be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be monitored prior to the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems anaemia can be caused by a erythropoietin deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells, thereby reducing the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) was introduced, enabling it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">When administered as an injection into a vein in a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems, Abseamed was compared with the reference medicines.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo in a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either amed to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ablesamed under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients being amed to Abseamed were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Streamed pad may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Amed amed as injections under the skin, it is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the Medicines Agency showed that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that has produced Abseamed is providing information packages to the medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction in patients with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of a transfusion exists due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the onset of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate, in case of planned major surgical interventions which require large blood volume compensation (4 or more units blood in men; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of external blood Abseamed can be used in adults without iron deficiency before a large elective orthopaedic surgery, where there is a high risk of transfusion complications.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml may be applied which cannot take part in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Hemoglobin target concentration ranges between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for paediatric patients, in which the hemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l) should lie.</seg>
<seg id="386">Anemia symptoms and results may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin, a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for control of anemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.E. / kg three times a week using an intravenous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and subsequent releases may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin, a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for controlling the anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the hemoglobin value has increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the particle number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl relative to the initial value, the dose should be maintained at 150 I.U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin rise &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the nutritional value of &lt; 40.000 cells / µl have risen above the baseline, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after a further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.E. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value ≥ 0.1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the particle number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl has increased, the dose should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the particle number of &lt; 40.000 cells / µl opposite the initial value, a response to the epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), where the initial storage of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, abseamed in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg of body weight should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation program - to make large iron reserves available before the start of the abortion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case, epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg in each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis via the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to flush the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug to the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from erythropoetin (Pure Red Cell Aplacsia, PRCA) should not be streamed or another erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, escort or underlying disease; severe coronary heart disease, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently returned heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the appearance of an anti-body mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden drop in function, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the nutritional value should be determined and the usual causes for failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminescence intoxication, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the nutritional value is low, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the reticulocyte index), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other reason of an effect is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow to diagnose a PRCA are considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous injections in patients with a risk for an anti-body-induced PRCA (patients with renal anaemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney failure, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit to the administration of epoetins when the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for controlling the anaemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in hemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evidential coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency which are not yet dialysis is not accelerated by the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In the case of tumour patients receiving chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa and erythropoetin response should be taken into account (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapyrelated anaemia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the use of recombinant erythropoietin should be based on a benefit-risk weighing involving the participation of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are provided for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, before the start of epoetin-alfa therapy the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing greater elective orthopaedics should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that an increased risk for post-operative thrombotic / vascular events can occur when treating epoetin alfa for patients with a starting point of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro experiments on tumor tissues, there is no indication of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in regard to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebral thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from erythropoetin, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients suffering from erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically-derived epoetin alfa is glycosilized and is identical with the endogenous humanic erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.</seg>

<seg id="567">Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: • osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high risk of fracture (fractures), including those who recently suffered a traumatic hermetic fracture such as failure; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fractures should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125 000 IE) prior to first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (means against inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">Since the active ingredient in Aclasta is the same as in Zometa, part of the data material for zometa was used to evaluate Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">The first study included nearly 8,000 older women with osteoporosis, and the number of spinal and hip fractures was examined over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures has been studied for a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In two studies, Aclasta was tested in two studies involving 357 patients and compared with risedronate (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of the alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis therapies) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">In comparison to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis candidates), the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of Aclasta's side effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less common with repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledron acid or other bisphosphonates or any other components.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Additional indication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required of appropriate supply of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms of serious side effects • When on medical or nursing assistance is resorted</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recently diagnosed low-traumatic acetate fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic acetate fracture, the administration of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the pathogen Paget with Aclasta a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently diagnosed low-traumatic acetate fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D before the first Aclasta infusion is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin clearing &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents in Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data on safety and efficacy are lacking.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Before starting the therapy with Aclasta, an existing hypokalemia should be treated with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Because of the rapid insertion of the effect of zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia may develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="604">For patients who need dental interventions, no data is available whether the interruption of bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of adverse events reported by atrial fibrillation was increased in patients who received Aclasta (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients who received placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the Osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation was comparable between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), random (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) unwanted drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledron acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which expressed itself as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinin Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years comparable to the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta versus 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2.10 mmol / l), occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplemental amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to prevent clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to prevent clinical fractures after a recently taken hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured routinely, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of oledron acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the infusion location, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area Occurally, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primary in the jaw area) reported that with bisphosphonates, including zoledron acid, were treated.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental practices.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients showed osteonekrose in the jaw area of a patients treated with Aclasta and placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the event of overdosing, which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation can be achieved by the addition of oral calcium and / or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density protein (BMD) -T-Score for the lower lid ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebrate fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on the morphometric cell fractures Aclasta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared with placebo (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on acetate fractures Aclasta had an equally lasting effect over three years, which resulted in reduced risk for hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta elevated the bone density on lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of bone density in lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire waist by 6.0%, the lower thigh by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 postmenopausal osteoporosis patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic crest.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase of trabecular bone volume compared to placebo and the maintenance of trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal Propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and beta-C telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum were determined in groups of 517 to 1,246 in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta reduced significantly by 30% after 12 months compared to the baseline and was maintained at 28% below the baseline value for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the baseline value for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the baseline value for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study the Aclasta treatment increased BMD compared to placebo treatment at all points of time.</seg>
<seg id="636">Over 24 months compared to placebo, Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% on the overall fifth and 4.3% on the Schenkelhal.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in the clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (CZOL446M2308), the once yearly administration of alendronate was not subject to the monthly administration of alendronate based on the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta has been studied in patients and patients over the age of 30 with radiologically confirmed, mainly mild to moderately severe Morbus Paget of the bone (medium serum levels of alkaline phosphatase corresponding to 2.6x to 3,0x age-specific upper normal values for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledron acid compared to taking 30 mg of Risedron once daily for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronate was observed after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 with Risedronate treated patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response in 141 of patients treated with Risedronate could be maintained with an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearing from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ to 1.87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination duration t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early phases of the distribution (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent the quick resorption in the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of the dose 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration vs. time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearing of substances being metabolized by cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because zoledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearing of the Coledron acid correlated with the Colourinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) in the 64 patients.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a creatinin clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because of severe renal dysfunction (Creatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data is available, no statements can be made for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-effective intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies on dogs, single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of zoledron acid was administered in rats by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose corresponding to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application of accumulated exposures that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as intravenous injection points.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent occurrence in trials with repeated application was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysical of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding which reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in doses above 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to low serum levels of calcium.</seg>

<seg id="749">A summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report (EPAR) which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin, it can also be applied to patients (especially overweight patients) that can not be adjusted satisfactorily with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilised and the blood sugar level decreases and type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was examined; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional dose of actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylude in a reduction of HbA1c values decreased by 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin had a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesiesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be used in patients who may react sensitively (allergic) to pioglitazon or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high level of ketone - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin, Actos will serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin for patients whose metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the transport of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the marker" "" "15" "" "and on the other hand the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is inappropriate for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor (e.g. former heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac safety.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outflow study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in the reports on heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated initial liver enzyme values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, e.g. unexplained nausea, vomiting, overlying problems, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of patients with pioglitazone should be conducted by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are present.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can lead to fat deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution a slight reduction of mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematocron (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematoglobin by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive Pioglitazon as oral bidirectional or triple combination therapy with a sulfonylude or dual combination therapy with insulin have the risk of high dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch was reported under the treatment with thiazolidindigenes, including pioglitazone, a occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is not clear whether there is a direct correlation between taking pioglitazone and the appearance of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological clarification should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with Pioglitazon and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) treated with pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or if this occurs, the treatment is to be suspended (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on interaction have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxine, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC from Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 Inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC by Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that the treatment with pioglitazone diminishes the blood insulin resistance of the mother animal during pregnancy and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic rate for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimated from present data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the tumor and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, ALT ascents exceeded the three times the upper limit of the normal range as frequently as placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with preexisting advanced macular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo when pioglitazone bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, heart failure has rarely been reported under Pioglitazone, but more often when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">In summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon groups and more than 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years in ProActive study, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ), which in the animal model results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It was shown that pioglitazone reduced glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose utilisation in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the onset of therapy a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by pioglitazone at 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of the three-month optimization phase were randomized to pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quota showed in pioglitazone compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels and a slight, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol level were observed in most clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced total plastic matrices and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazid and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels was observed under Pioglitazon whereas values decreased under Metformin and Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a 20-week study, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the Nüchtern triglyceride levels, but also improved the post-denounced increased triglyceride level, this has an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outflow study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised to either pioglitazon or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral use, pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, whereby the peak concentrations of immutable pioglitazone in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equal to triple the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal markedly.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it has been demonstrated that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxine, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the Fäxes (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversibly eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone, the blood insulin resistance in the gestation diminishes and increases the insulin resistance of the mother animal and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic rate for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) the rat induces increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolide indicons led to an increased frequency of colon tumors.</seg>

<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with each Pioglitazone or Gliclazid were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quota showed in pioglitazone compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a 20-week study, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the Nüchtern triglyceride levels, but also improved the post-denounced increased triglyceride level, this has an effect on the tryglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="884">General disorders and complaints at the administration site Occurally - Local hypersensitivity reactions to the injection site During insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma can occur at the injection site).</seg>
<seg id="885">Disorders of the immune system Occurally - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotonic edema, breathing difficulties, palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia can, however, develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemics with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by an assigned aid or by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum working maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with a faster or delayed absorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A series of split (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration; none of the metabolites formed by the division are active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated injection, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not allow any particular hazard to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actrophane water bottle has been removed from the refrigerator - to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is resuscated in accordance with the instructions for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions after changing animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="894">The doctor must therefore take into account any possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines they have taken.</seg>

<seg id="896">13 An intensive improvement of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in blood sugar regulation can, however, be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="897">The terminale half-life (t ½) is therefore rather a measure of resorption than a measure of elimination by se of the insulin coming from the plasma (insulin has a brood in the bloodstream of only a few minutes).</seg>

<seg id="1171">In the first study, involving 1,072 patients, the efficacy of three different adenuric doses (once daily 80, 120 and 240 mg) was compared with a placebo (hypodermic) and allopurinol (another medicine for the treatment of hyperuricemia).</seg>
<seg id="1172">In the second study two doses of Adenuric (once daily 80 and 120 mg) were compared to 762 patients each with allopurinol.</seg>
<seg id="1173">In both studies, allopurinol was administered in a dose of 300 mg once a day; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose levels of uric acid in the blood was below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements.</seg>

<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAIDs / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase of adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without requiring a dose adjustment for febuxostat or the other active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving subjects, 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily had an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, suggesting a possible weak inhibitory effect of febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antacids It could be shown that simultaneous consumption of an antazium containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide was delayed by the absorption of febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a reduction in CMAx by 32%, but no significant change in AUC effect.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregnancies does not include side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the fetus / newborn health.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, serving machines or when performing dangerous activities until they can be reasonably assured that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall febuxostasis group compared to the Allopurinol group in the pivotal study phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were an arteriosklerotic disorder and / or a myocardial infarction or a degenerative heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Febuxostat and more than once reported in all the Febuxostat treatment groups are listed below.</seg>

<seg id="1204">The events reported during long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxosta- treatment groups in total more than once and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to the data occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either reported in the pivotal studies of Phase 3, either at all or with a lesser frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypaesthesia, conspicuous EKG, coughing, short breath, proteinuria, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase in potassium concentration in the blood, decrease in lymphocyte number, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>

<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The effectiveness of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of Phase 3 (APEX Study and FACT trial as described below), which were conducted with 1,832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">In each study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) were identified.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 10) for patients with a serum increment value at study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg / l (357 µmol / l) (see table 2 and Figure 1) as well as ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional doses of allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT-study showed statistically significant superiority in both treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg / l (357 µmol / l) compared to the treatment with ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the regular dose of allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1216">The lowering of the serum resin table to &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum increas &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney function restrictions The APEX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney dysfunctions (D).</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy endpoint was 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage return of serum concentrations in subjects, regardless of kidney function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney dysfunctions).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum resin concentrations of ≥ 10 mg / dl of Etwa 40% of the patients (baseline) had a serum diaphragm concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from phase 3, which was collected in two years, showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels of &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheumatism, so less than 3% of patients needed treatment against gout in the months 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of patients had no treatment against gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the gouge size, resulting in 54% of patients with a complete breakdown of the plaster grades up to 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSHE values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients who received long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also received in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in open long term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses are dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is larger than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAx is about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change in the percentage drop in serum resin concentrations was observed, as long as this was checked (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent stoady state distribution volume (Vss / F) from Febuxostat is between 29 and 75 l, after doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma protein binding of Febuxostat amounts to about 99.2% (primary bond to albumin) and is constant over the concentration range, which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomen showed that these oxidative metabolites are mainly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid is mainly created by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking a 80 mg dose of 14C-marked febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was found in the urine as unaltered Febuxostat (3%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion via the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the stool was found as unaltered Febuxostat (12%), Acylglukuronide of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat increased approximately the 1.8 times of 7.5 μ gunde / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ gineh / ml in the group with severe kidney toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver functioning restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Childpowder Pugh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B) Liver functioning restriction, the CMAx and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Age There were no significant changes in regard to the AUC of Febuxostat or its metabolites after intake of multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility in male rats was found only in connection with Xanthin-stones in the highly-dose treated group, about 11-times exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purinisation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It was noted that febuxostat in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about 4.3 times of human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity matured, which was accompanied by a reduction in breeding performance and a development delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in supporting rats with expositions, which approximately 4,3 times and with trained rabbits with expositions, who were approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure, did not reveal any teratogenic effects.</seg>

<seg id="1256">ADENURIC may not be taken if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredient Febuxostat or any of the other components of ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine if you have a heart failure or have any other heart problem. • If you suffer from a high urinary acid concentration as a result of a cancer or the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (a rare congenital disease in which too much uric acid is in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="1258">If you have a rheumatic attack at the moment (sudden appearance of severe pain, pressure sensitivity, redness, heat and joint swelling), wait until the attack is dropped before starting the treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be with everyone, but could also occur with you, especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months, if you are taking ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will also prescribe other medicines if necessary, in order to prevent a gout attack or to treat the associated symptoms (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medications or have been taken / used recently, even if they are non-prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is especially important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking medicines / apply one of the following substances as interactions with ADENURIC may occur and your doctor may wish to consider necessary measures. • Mercaptopurin (for the treatment of asthma) • Chlorophylline (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for blood thinning in heart disease)</seg>
<seg id="1263">There have been no studies on the effects of ADENURIC on the transport capacity and the ability to operate machines.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medications (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals approved in the European Union, the Company submitted data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to prove the efficacy of ADROVANCE in terms of boosting vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15 week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who received alendronate alone (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also submitted data suggesting that the alendronate contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed for preventing bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, musculoskeletal pain, constipation, diarrhea (diarrhea), flatulence (ulcera) of the esophagus, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), inflated abdomen (bloated abdomen) as well as acid collisions.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any other components, ADROVANCE may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It may not be used in oesophagus diseases, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following indications are to follow exactly in order to reduce the risk of irritated irritations and related side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • Patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract besides pyloroplasty are only given under special caution (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, esophageal ulcera and raophageal erosions, were reported in patients taking alendronate (partly these were severe and required a hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be advised to suspend the medicine after symptoms of ophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe eye-hageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with alendronate no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenal ulcers, among them some severe and associated with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonecrosis of the jaw, typically associated with a tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen administered mainly intravenous bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available that indicate whether bisphosphonatal care in patients who need a jaw-surgical procedure reduce the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment by the treating physician is authoritative for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet in the next morning if they are unable to take a dose of ADROVANCE after they have noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the scheduled weekly day.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases that affect mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be treated adequately before starting the treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking alendronate, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, alendronate was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions occurring.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for the use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy nor by breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteonecrosis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bisphosphonates; most of the reports were reported by cancer patients, but also was reported in osteoporosis patients.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, absorption of serum levels of &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and serum phosphate to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Studies with alendronate once a week 70 mg (n = 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n = 370) were demonstrated in a one-year multicenter study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture in postmenopausal women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) and in the fracture intervention study (FIT: n = 6.459).</seg>

<seg id="1323">In this study the daily dose of alendronate reduced the appearance of at least one new vertebrate fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption of an intravenous reference dose was the mean orale bioavailability of alendronate in women 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fast and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">The bioavailability decreased to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% if Alendronate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>

<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) led to no clinically significant change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies in rats have shown that alendronate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue following IV administration of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly dispersed into the bone or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After IV administration of a single dose of 14C allendronate, about 50% of the radioactive substance was excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the fences.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Following the intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml / min and systemic clearing was not exceeded 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">In rats, alendronate is not excreted by the kidneys via the acid or alkaline transport system and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the excretion of other medicines by these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1402">Since tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft are already being used in the EU, the company has presented the results from previous studies with Prograf / Prograft as well as data from the published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, with the application of Advagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after one year (for example, examining how often a renewed organ transplant or a resumption of the dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant were performed and investigated how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this drug or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this may lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level provisions (see below "Recommendations")</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagf, the tacrolimus-tallevels should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Day 4, systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus Talks are recommended during the first two weeks of transplanting under Advagf to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate night ransplantation period.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, an adjustment of the advance dose can take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application For suppression of transplant rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplantation prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral Advancement therapy should start at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments can be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral Advancement therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted to a transplant recipient of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraf, so this conversion has to take place in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant After switching from other immunosuppressants to Advent once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initialdose recommended in renal and liver transplant must commence for the prophylaxis of transplant rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients who are converted to law, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there are no clinical experience with lawyer in lung, pancreatic and colorectal patients, was used in a oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, for transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in specific patient groups Patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the desired area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum levels of serum, a calculation of the Kreatininclearance and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Caution is advised (see Section4.4 and 4.5) when switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of full blood-tacrolimus-talklevel inspections.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of tacrolimus tallevels during the first two weeks of transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled following conversion from Prograf to Advent, dose adjustment, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or concurrent application of substances that could change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments on the dose may require several days until the steady state has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases, if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, tacrolimus levels in full blood usually lie in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and adrenal - and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant receivers, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur in the wake of tacrolimus under- or over-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with transplant rejection, which proved to be therapeutical opposite other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of tacrolimusculature in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other plant remedies during treatment with adventia (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly thorough monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered, since the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a corneal or septum hypertrophie described as cardiomyopathy was to be observed, which can therefore occur under law.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overloading and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headache, altered state of consciousness, cramps and visual disturbances, a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels concurrently with substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism, and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was associated with antifungal antibiotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, ittraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolization.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized with drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 whose metabolism is affecting.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus down the Clearance of Steroid contraceptives and thus increase the hormone level, decisions about contraceptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus could potentially decrease the Clearance of Pentobarbital and Phenacon and extend their half-life time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that under tacrolimus an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy is reported under Tacrolimus.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high retention of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, tacrolimus can not be dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects On a molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus can be mediated by binding to a cytosoly protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cellular memory.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcium-dependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell, thereby preventing the transcription of a certain set of lymphocytic genes.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies was consistent with observations in the large studies in which prograf was used to treat liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients to primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicentre study with oral prograf was reported on 110 patients who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterate syndrome, was less common in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In patients treated with tacrolimus, there were 21.7% of cases in the creation of a bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be converted to Tacrolimus was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients converted by Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the treatment of transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliteral syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicenter study with oral prograf was performed on 205 patients who underwent a pancreatic and kidney transplantation following a randomised procedure tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the desired talklevel from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colorectal grafts showed an updated survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by corticosteroids, should be responsible for higher clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion occurs mainly via bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">For stable patients who have been converted from Prograf (twice daily) to the total daily dose, systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under law was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advent is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital heart defect caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Advent is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced according to a method called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) was introduced, enabling it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advent is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is produced differently, so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the drug was used to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advents in preventing bleedings in 86% of 510 new bleedings with "excellent" or "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advent (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">It may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">"" "" "" "in March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit to transport Advent across the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, after the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.U. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Repeat every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours for patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the danger for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, an appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma is recommended to control the dose and frequency of injections to be administered.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, varying in vivo recovery and having different half-value periods.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis The long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an adequate dose, a test must be performed to verify an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitory values, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should depend on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to the Factor VIII, where the risk within the first 20 expositional stages is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pretreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure-days and anamnestically known inhibitory development, after switching from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women, there is no experience of the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs associated with the largest number of patients were inhibitors against Factor VIII (5 patients), all with previously untreated patients showing a higher risk to the formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-mirror was performed postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperatively) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and the factor VIII- Mirror in the plasma as well as the Clearance Rate again showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 2 with severe moderate to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient after 26 exposure days with ADVATE showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) were detected by a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study were 5 of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titres against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels versus anti-CHO cell protein, but there were no signs or symptoms pointing to an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients, the incidence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products ADVATE was reported on hypersensitivity reactions from the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactosis reactions (frequency unknown).</seg>
<seg id="1567">The activated factor VIII acts as a factor factor for the activated Factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were performed in pre-treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (base value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2%).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the value-risk assessment as a positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP based on the safety profile of ADVATE, which requires a submission of PSURs every 6 months, has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited granted approval to the Committee on Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for the promotion of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that connects and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is an "Adenovirus" that has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infection in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumour and thus enable the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In case of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not working properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient who joined Li-Fraumeni's cancer in the field of undergrowth, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the submitted documents, the CHMP will compile a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin Injection in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore offers benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful nor harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company has not informed the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "altered mode of action" "" "means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly releases over several hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminate as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (blocked nose), are canceled.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effects were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hayfever symptoms except constipation of the nose, patients receiving aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who received Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of aero (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotoric hyperactivity (restlessness), anorexia (lack of appetite), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or loratadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from severe angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertonia), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyrophy) or a haemorrhagic stroke (stroke) or a risk for a haemorhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for the introduction of aerosaze across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but can be swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking it, crushing or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not continue after the symptoms diminish.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days, as long-term utilisation can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decrease in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, Ergotamin, Dihydrogotamine or other deongestational medicines called phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data is not sufficient to express appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aero-aze were not examined in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to express appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or amplification of the headache) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of following patient groups, caution is advised: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder halting or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is recommended for at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistaminika can otherwise prevent positive reactions to skin reactions or reduce their size.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadin where erythromycin or ketoconazole were dosed in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and those treated with placebo, regardless of whether desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate is nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerosaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities in comparison to frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aero-aze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a lightheadedness, which can lead to impairment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, aggravated Miktion, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precorral pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil rigidity and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement variables of flight rates including amplification of subjectively drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was detected.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as increasing blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged 12 to 78 years of age took part with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine-antagonistic efficacy of aerosaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerosaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity adherence.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the administration of plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the perorative application of aerosaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the floating equilibrium of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study, which was conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that 4 subjects of desloratadin were badly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was exposed to exposure of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">However, based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated injection, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the regulatory submission, the pharmacovigilance system described and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistaminika contribute to the relief of allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, ongoing or itchy nose and drowning or itching eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if you have experienced or diagnosed the following symptoms or diseases when using Aerinaze: • Blood pressure • Heart chasing, palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea and headache, or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking medicines with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is non-prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">The use in the recommended dosage is not to be reckoned with, that aero leads to dizziness or reduces the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take a dose of Aerinaze if you forgot to take a dose in time, get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Chasing, restlessness with increased physical activity, dry mouth, dizziness, sore throat, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, fatigue, headache, sleep disorders, nervousness and dizziness.</seg>
<seg id="1716">Heartbeat or heart rhythm disorders, increased physical activity, redness, swelling, confusion, blurred vision, dry eyes, nose bleeding, nasal irritation, nasal pain, nasal irritation, nausea, chills, diminution of the sense of smell, conspicuous liver function, agitation, anxiety, and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="1717">After the launch of Desloratadin very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives rash and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, sleep disorders, muscle aches, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of liver inflammation and over cases of eye-catching liver cells was also rarely reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg and 5 mg of fusion tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged 1-5, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or milk.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by identifying the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the noodles, difficulty of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body uses the syrup, the solution for inserting and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the symptom-scores (symptom-scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria the decrease in symptoms after six weeks with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% was compared with placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to dis-loratadin, loratadin or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for the placing of Aerius in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the hypoallergenic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the current disease process and may be terminated after the symptoms diminish and be resumed during their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended permanent treatment during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials involving desloratadin tablets which were given in addition to erythromycin or ketoconazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">A clinical pharmacological study did not increase the performance of alcohol (see Section 5.1) concurrently with Aerius and alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness, which can lead to impairment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported side effects reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headache. this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, at which up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses at which desloratadin was administered for over 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, no prolongation of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement variables of flight rates including amplification of subjectively drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, erius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be classified depending on the duration of symptoms, alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the overall score for quality of life at Rhino-junctivitis, Aerius effectively diminishes the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of the urticaria as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of aetiology, is similar to the different forms and chronic patients can be recruited more easily prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the history of histamine is a causative factor in all urticular diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desloratadin also leads to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of the urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of noodles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study comparing patients with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients reached a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clues for clinically relevant Kumulative after once daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate is nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study involving desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated injection, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (contains lactose-monohydrate, Hypromellose, Titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains Hypromellose, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, bleached wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see Section 4.4) and that no data available to support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with erius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis, physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">For about 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years, desloratadin is metabolized and experienced higher substance exposure (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years is identical to that of children who metabolise normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-lactose-absorption or sucrose-isomaltase- insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, concurrent Aerius tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance of alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the Aerius Sirup group as with the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria were reported at the recommended dose of 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study in adults and adolescents, where up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. formally announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company withdraws its application for authorization to prevent aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used for adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that is intended to protect from a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person, because humans have no immunity (no protection) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "after administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as" "" "foreign" "" "and forms antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane envelope of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognises the human body as alien), was purified, purified and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for precimppandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are interested in a clinical trial and need further information about your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For further information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, apprease is available as a solution to intake, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined the antiviral drugs used by the patient, and the likelihood of the virus will respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which is taken together with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is calculated according to body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood when combined with other antiviral drugs and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS cannot cure, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 infected adults who had not previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">In 206 adults who had taken protease inhibitors were compared with other protease inhibitors at 206 adults with low dosed ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had not taken protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were very few to respond to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drugs Agenerase strengthened the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it was associated with ritonavir to increase the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients who use St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are removed as well as agenerations and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take Agenerase have the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), an osteonecrose (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1-infected adults and children treated with protease inhibitors over four years compared the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic enhancer Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of Agenase in combination with ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "as only limited information was available for scientific reasons at the time of approval." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the transport of Agenerase across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1-infected, protease inhibitor (PI) -pretreated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules are to be administered to pharmacokinetic booster of amprenavir together with low doses of ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution to intake on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2. if Agenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing additive of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of assays (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be prescribed cautiously in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction; in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the cytochrome P450-isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with asgenerase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Generally, Agenerase capsules are to be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hepatic function including a chronic-active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver function disorders under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of asgenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroidal manifestations including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of assays with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhubarb olysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods for determining the substance concentrations are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opium, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycolin content of the Agenerase solution for inserting, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be removed in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy drugs needed to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Haemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemothrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorial eology is adopted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonekrose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the cytochrome P450-isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir may not be given together with pharmaceuticals, whose active ingredients are metabolized predominantly via CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir leading to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In an attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already uses St. John's wort, the amprenavirus levels and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, whereas CMAx degrades 30% if ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg amprenavir were used twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which have been achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily), are about 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amprenavir and caletra cannot be given, but a tight monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetical study to apply Agenerase in combination with Didanosine, but due to the attachable component of Didanosine it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dose adjustment is required in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors is low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapine may lower the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, be careful as Delaviron could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delaviron is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous application of amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of Riverfabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in side effects associated with Riverfabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dose of Rifabutin will fall to at least half the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asgenerase in combination with erythromycin did not have been performed, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of Ritonavir with 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in CMAx of ketoconazole in comparison to the value observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors from CYP3A4, may possibly result in interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions linked to these medicines if they are used in combination with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as agenerase as it can lead to erectile dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as an enzyme (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Isradipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased 10 by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent use with Agenerase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side effects with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual impairment and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels rose significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous application of Agenase with ritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroidal manifestations (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are expected to increase plasma levels at the same time as Agenerase is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may lead to myopathy, including a rhubarb olysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous injection of amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenase should not be applied together with Midazolam taken orally (see section 4.3), while at the same time it is advisable to use parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors point to a possible increase in Midazolam plasma levels by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opium, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation is given at the moment to adjust the amprenavirus dose when amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With concurrent administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening anti-thrombotic effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods of contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (such as Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended concurrent asAgenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefit for the mother compared to possible risks to the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactating rats, amprenavir-related substances have been proven, but it is not known whether Amprenavir passes into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of vile rats, which was administered by the incineration in the uterus to the end of the breastfeeding period of Amblaavir, showed a reduced increase in 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The safety of Agenerase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occuring early on and rarely led to the onset of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are associated with the use of Agenerase or another medicine used at the same time as HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as subsequent laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and facial fat tissue, increased intraabdominals and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocerebral fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral individuals treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stitching) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecrose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">Infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerase twice daily along with low dosed ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of side effects (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those observed under sole asgenerase treatment; one exception was increases of triglycerides and CPK values, which were observed in patients who received Agenerase along with low dosed ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is to be observed for signs of intoxication. (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures must be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyproteinterines with the result of formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The anti-viral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitor (IC50) of amprenavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral, non-treated patients with the currently approved fossiamprenavir / ritonavir dosages - as in other ritonavir treatment schemas with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients receiving 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of ritonavir twice daily in ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of 13 of 14 children in which a virologistic failure occurred within the 59 patients with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / L, I54L / M / T / V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I82A / I, I84V, I84V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its prolongation APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred over 96 weeks following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic interpretation systems based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic assessment systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs (isolating points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples associated with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir creates a certain cross-resistance against ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir, however, remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral patients in which a Fosamprenavirus (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / ritonavir (three of 25 insulates), indinavir / ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), and saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), and Tidenavir / ritonavir (four of 24 insulates) appear.</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early cancelling of a failing treatment is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that can have a detrimental impact on subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">Evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which PI pretreated adults with virologistic failure (100 mg twice daily) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with low-dosed ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-inferiority of APV / ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-slip threshold of 0,4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of unbiased asgenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2-18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was tested twice a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg two times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) versus the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on these data, the anticipated benefits of" "" "unbiased" "" "Agenerase should be considered in therapy optimisation in treating with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for CMAx, on the other hand, reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal causes a 25% decrease in the AUC but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was impacted by food intake, although the simultaneous dietary intake affects the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredient varies during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the cMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines which induce or inhibit CYP3A4, or a substrate of CYP3A4, must be administered with caution when given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure, as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable than the capsules; therefore, Agenase's solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearing of Ritoravir is negligible, so the effect of a renal dysfunction on the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir is likely to be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2056">The underlying mechanism for the development of hepatocellular Adenomas and carcinomas was not yet cleared and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there was little evidence for the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans, both from clinical trials and for the therapeutic application.</seg>

<seg id="2060">Until now, no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of Agenase nor after the treatment has been treated.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>

<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amprenavir and caletra cannot be given, but a tight monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors is low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delaviron is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dose of Rifabutin will fall to at least half the recommended dose 31, although no clinical data is available for this.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Isradipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels rose significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With concurrent administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening anti-thrombotic effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin by Amheravir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2084">The anti-viral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibitor (IC50) of amprenavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, the anticipated benefits of "unbiased" Agenerase should be considered in therapy optimisation in treating with PI pretreated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredient varies during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the cMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and considered probable or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine-cream related side effects in studies with three-week treatment were local reactions to the site of the treatment of the genital warts (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most frequently reported and considered probable or possibly associated with the application of imiquimodine cream related side effects include discomfort at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Basalioma patients treated with Imiquimodal-cream from a placebo-controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse effects in these studies were a reaction to the application location (22% of patients treated with imiquimodine) in these studies (22% of patients treated with imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects identified by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of Imiquimine-cream treated patients with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">According to the investigational plan, the clinical signs indicated that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimodine cream frequently resulted in local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreation / abortion / abortion (23%) and edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the investigational plan, evaluating the clinical signs indicated that in these studies five times weekly treatment with Imiquimodine cream was very common with severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and to severe snoring and tasting (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials for the treatment of imiquimine for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was noted with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent oral intake of 200 mg of Imiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, may lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically significant side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted in hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were demonstrated in the topical application of imiquimodine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 phase-relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that the efficacy in relation to complete eradication of the warts during Imiquimodine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo-treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the total 119 patients treated with imiquimodine the warts were completely healed; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients who had placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved in 23% of 157 male patients treated with imiquimodine compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimodine in five times per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superfictional basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were cured and stayed for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non hyperkeratotic, non hypertrophic acne lesions within a related 25 cm2 area of treatment on the uneasiness of scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical radiation after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications, actinic keratosis, and supernormal basal cell carcinoma do not usually occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials for children aged 2-15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimodine n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimodine was not shown in these studies at the dosages investigated there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest medication concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bed 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data for systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimodine was low after topical application on MC-infected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or supernormal basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on the dermal toxicity at the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased milz weight; another four-month study on the dermal application revealed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with dermal administration of three days a week did not induce tumours in the application area.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimodine only has a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for the human being is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the agent-free cream, earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for drug replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, complicate movements, decreased lung capacity, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be carried out at a hospital or clinic with revitation devices, and patients may require appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study focused primarily on the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect regarding reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal sized liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients at the age of more than five (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five include increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measure of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known each year and where necessary to update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive Aldurazyme regarding the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit to transport Aldurazyme to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-isduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzymatic therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been established, and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been established, and no dosing scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-conditional reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only take place in an appropriate clinical setting where revitalization facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that nearly all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding the resumption of the treatment after a longer break, the risk of hypersensitivity after an interruption of the treatment must be cautiously investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Treat 60 minutes before the start of infusion with medicines (antihistaminika and / or antipyreka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or moderate infusion, the treatment should be considered with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or a reduction in infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-induced reaction, the infusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procain because there is a potential risk of interferenz with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy that include embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data is available to newborns exposed to laronidase over mother's milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were primarily reported as infusion-related responses, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in relation to Aldurazyme observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table: very often (≥ 1 / 10); often ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, shortness of breath and facial edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with mostly severe expiration and a treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients received a Serokonversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a severe expiration mostly within one month to a seroconversion (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or until early excretion from the study), there were no investigational antibodies (RIP) assay in 13 / 45 patients, including 3 patients with which it was never seen as seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of antibody levels had a robust reduction of GAG's level in urine, while a variable reduction of GAG in urine was detected in patients with high antibody titres.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of undesirable drug reactions, even if the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasoning for the enzyme therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulating sub-strata and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate restoration of the enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Following IV infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysis, most likely to have glucose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were of the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary efficacy endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and absolute walking distance in the 6-minute enclosure.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg aldurazyms each week for another 3,5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and the enviability presented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as derived from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is not clinically significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear trash of the GAG-mirrors in the urine (µg / mg. of creatinine) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients who were considered clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage normal FEV, distance in 6-minute walking test, range of motion of shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">An open one year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years (16 patients with severe expiry form and 4 with the middle term).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- mirror in urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were observed after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe sequential form showed normal mental development speed whereas the older patients with severe expiration were limited or no advances in cognitive development were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of different Aldurazyme metering schemes were carried out on the GAG mirrors in urine, liver volume, and the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may represent a viable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer) in 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug for cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin lived an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months for the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months compared to docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom cancer did not attack the squamous cell were treated longer than with the mediator during the administration of Alimta.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the transport of Alimta throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each perforation bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the cleavage bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- Infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid has to be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed-Gift and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the ingestion must be continued throughout the treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first Pemetrexed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetrexed, a complete blood picture should be produced before each application, including a differentiation of leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate Transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle a dose examination must take place taking into account the Nadirs of the blood picture or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the preceding treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients must be treated according to indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop haematological toxicity ≥ level 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), the treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient receives the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients after 2 dosages a haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so on in the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials did not reveal that there is an increased side-efficiency risk in patients aged 65 years or above over 65 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a creatinin clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min which would exceed the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearing of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a function of a liver function of &gt; 1.5-times the upper bilirubin- limit value and / or Transaminasenwerten of &gt; to 3.0 times the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value (in presence of liver metastases) were not examined specifically in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone-bone immunosuppression and Pemetrexed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutrality count exceeds ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has again reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrality, platelet number and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in the previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">Lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 of haematological and non-maternal toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia were treated if pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with pemetrexed need to be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce the toxicity of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) have to avoid the simultaneous use of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsalivary (&gt; 1.3 g. daily) for at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients provided with pemetrexed have to avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life time for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with a clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion before the Pemetrexed treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving pellets rexed in combination with another cytotoxic compound.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible deterioration of the reproductive capacity is due to Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment gate to obtain advice regarding the sperm conserved.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-clearing ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) can result in reduced Pemetremixed excretion resulting in increased detection of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution should be advised if in patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-clearing ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or ce- tylsalicylic acid are used in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy, should be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs is available with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulae.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with anticabolic antimetabolites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy, except if it is absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to Pemetrexed, men should be advised prior to the onset of treatment in order to obtain advice regarding the sperm conserving.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetremixed is passed into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and randomised cisplatin and Pemetrexed, as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic non-folate which performs its action by interrupting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed acts as an antifold with multiple targets by blocking the thyme dylatsynthase (DHFR), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and glycine amidribcleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are the folate-dependent key enzymes of de novo Biosynthesis by thymidin- and Purinnucleotids.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, easy-blind stage 3 study of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin versus Cisplatin treated patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage of median 2.8 months of prolonged survival compared to those patients who were only diagnosed with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Patients who take Alli and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot metabolise some fats in the food, thereby causing around a quarter of the fats eaten with food undigested the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study Alli was compared to placebo in 391 obese patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients receiving Alli 60 mg received an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily patches on the anus, flatus (winch) with stucco finish, stuffy, greasy / oily chair, abrupt secretions (fences), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may not be used in patients who suffer from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (where not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or to cholestase (liver disease), and in pregnant women or breast-feeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for placing orlistat GSK across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with an easily hypokalische, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli should not be used by children and adolescents under the age of 18, as there is not enough data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, as orlistat is only minimally absorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Pregnancy to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see section 4.6 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or a rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes may be associated with improved metabolic control, patients receiving a medicine for diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the anti-diabetic must be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients taking alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">A reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma was observed in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with concurrent orlistat and Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="2522">For the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat the Quick-Values (international normalised ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta-carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take an additional multivitamin supplement prior to bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a single dose of ammiodarone, a marginal decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with the pharmacological effect of the drug as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal adverse events were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), sometimes (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of reported side effects identified after the market launch of orlistat is not known, as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of reported cases of orlistat overdose reported after the market launch, no side effects or similar adverse events were reported from the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on humans and animals, a rapid re-formation of any systemic effects resulting from the lipasinhibiting properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect takes place in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine through covalent bonding to the active Serin-Rest of the gastri and pankreatic elevations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials were derived that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocked the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 confirm the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalische, fat-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation) was evaluated as follows: as a change in the body weight in the study course (Table 1) and as part of the study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average cholesterol in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (baseline value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The mean change in LDL cholesterol with orlistat was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.4 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3,8% (baseline score 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The waist circumference was 4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (baseline value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolic orlistat were non-measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, not metabolic orlistat in plasma could be found sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients receiving a minimal invasive dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-Formyl-leucine group), could be identified, which represented approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated injection, genotoxicity, carcinogenous potential and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data cannot detect any particular risk for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2547">Pharmaceutical-vigilance system The owner of the market authorization system must ensure that the pharmacovigilance system, according to the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.8.1. of the application application, will be applied and works before and while the product is available on the market.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloha is used in chemotherapies, which are powerful trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine used as an antiemetic drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Alois was examined at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy regimens, which were severe trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with aloha showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy regimens, which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with aloha showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloe (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted a permit to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for the transport of Aloxian across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alois is indexed: for preventing acute nausea and vomiting in severe emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxian for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by strong emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroid given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon massage, patients with anamnestial obstacy or signs of subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injections.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advised with simultaneous dispensing of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in cases where the QT interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Besides chemotherapy, Alois is not intended to be used either in the days of chemotherapy or for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies Palonosetron did not obstruct the activity of the five examined chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single IV dose of Palonosetron and a steady-State- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the concurrent administration of CYP2D6 Inductors (dexamethasone and Rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (amimetidine, doxorubicine, chinidine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbina) had no significant effect on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies does not occur, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common side effects were observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (633 patients), which were at least linked to Aloxiam, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies of adverse events occurred as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-active relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out because of the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably not effective therapy with a aloof overdosing.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies a total of 1,132 patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 250 mg. of dolasetron (half-life period 7.3 hours) were given intravenously at day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double blind study 667 patients receiving strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of trials with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to clinical investigations, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and replicarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study, carried out at 221 healthy volunteers, was the assessment of the ECG-effects of intravenous palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations of a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are dosed proportionally in the whole dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After IV doses of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration in 11 testicular cancer patients was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days achieved total textual position (AUC0- ∞) with which after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg was comparable; however, the CMAx was higher after the one-time yield of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites which, compared to Palonosetron, have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as immutable substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous wound closure in healthy corneas, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal elimination-time and the average systemic exposure with palonosetron are increased, but a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects have been observed only after exposures that are considered adequate above the maximum humantherapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies indicated that palleonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and can extend the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose was equivalent to 30x of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumours in rats but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and because Aloe is determined in humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is considered to be low for people.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the approval of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same medicinal product approved in the EU (also known as" "" "reference medicines" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue has damages and the values of the liver enzyme Alanin aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormally increase.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to stimulate the development of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medication to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non business purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged What were the biggest concerns that prompted CHMP to say authorization for placing on the market?</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been voiced that the data on the stability of the drug and the medicine to be marketed cannot be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responding to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">Following the treatment with Alpheon, the disease regressed in more patients than with the reference medicines; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition, the test used in the study was used to investigate the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection that is associated with crust formation) and small infected laths (crack or cut-off), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections that have been detectable or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the skin surface to be treated cannot be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection ended after the treatment ended.</seg>
<seg id="2679">139 patients (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected wound patients, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in case of studies, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA, Altargo is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the place of application.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small hospitals, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted permission to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. for the transport of Altargo to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of raising awareness or severe local irritation by applying reapamulin intment, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection can begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as a pathogen (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials with secondary wounds the efficacy of retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after 2 to 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous application of reapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations observed in humans after topical application on skuled skin or infected superficial wounds (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole, the middle Retapamulin ALC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe increased by 81% on the skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not required if topical retinapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral ingesting and are inadequate in terms of a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial treatment is indicated clearly and the use of retapamulin is preferable to the administration of systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether the breastfeeding continues / terminates or the treatment with Altargo continues / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breast-feeding and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most commonly reported side effect of irritation at the administration site, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance which is isolated from clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the Peptidyltransferase center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding site, whistromutiline inhibits peptidyltransfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50-ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of retapamulin at least some infection forms appears to be alarming, consultation with experts should be sought.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to respond to S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact and on shielded skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in people after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of skuled skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism of human liver microsoms in vitro oxidative metabolism was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with small involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro investigation on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphooma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rats-microkernel test for in-vivo examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats showing signs of limited fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, making up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 skinned skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats, ≥ 150 mg / kg / day dose toxicity was determined at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the market authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 module of the application application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder agrees to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and included in the 1.8.2 module of the application application as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use, the updated RMP will be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">If irritation or other signs and symptoms show in the treated area, you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, at the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is out of sight on one of these areas, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is available in an aluminium tube with a plastic closure that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminum pouch containing 0.5 g of ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two-dose vaccine, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunisation and it is ensured that the vaccination plan can be carried out in two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose of hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by "teach" the immune system (the body's natural defences) as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and creates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the Vaccine, which has been approved since 1996, and the recently admitted Vaccine for Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same illnesses, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix grown-ups were also used as evidence of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children, which had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led 98% to 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to a six-month and a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">Most common side effects of Ambirix are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection location, redness, maturability (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation scheme with Ambirix is made up of two doses of vaccination. the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered from six to twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a novel vaccination is required for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine may be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) are the same as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured that immunocompetent persons who responded to a hepatitis C vaccination need a refresher vaccination as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory with no more detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3. as with all injection-vaccines, in the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine, containing 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies in certain cases, so that further doses of vaccination can be needed in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal impact success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can be injected subcutanally as an exception, since it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the second year of life with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or combined with a combined Masern- mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it has to be assumed that there is no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturiness, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the previous Thiomerang and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants ranging from 12 to 15 years old, Ambirix's tolerance was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturality on a calculation basis per doses of Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the application of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects after receiving a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the subjects receiving Ambirix had pain, 63.8% in the subjects which had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable to a proband (i.e. 39.6% of the test persons who received Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the test subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and maturation was low and comparable to that observed after the combination of the combination-vaccine with the 3-doses vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparison study at 1 to 11-year-old vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6 to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies carried out at vaccines aged 1 to 15 years, the Seroconversions for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The anti-HBs seroconversions were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose administered to the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year olds, 142 two cans of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was worthless, serum rates (SP in the table below) versus hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the 3-dose vaccine were significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study for 1 to 11-year-olds following completion of full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-doses vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to those found after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies was comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme to the in the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose Ambirix was administered at the same time as a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined mash-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversions as for the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after resuspening by eyeglasses on possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms that are similar to those after hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may be caused by itchy rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child has a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">In case of a potential risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of an inoculation with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per doses (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection before end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected to persons suffering from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened by illness or treatment in your body's own defences, or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals on vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strong the response to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take additional drugs (including those you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have been vaccinated recently / has received / has been vaccinated or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">It may be, however, that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as many limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immunoglobulines, it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Typically, Ambirix will not be given pregnant or breastfeeding women, unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic) in your child.</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data that has become known since the issuance of the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP acknowledges that the benefit-risk relationship for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was placed in transport only in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia - divided into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomia (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, as ammonia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a sham medicine, i.e., without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disorders or taste sensation, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "ammonia has been approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme defect already manifests in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests after the first life month) there is an indication for use when a hyperammonia encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">AMMONAPS is also available in granular form for infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients suffering from swallowing disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swallowing, as there is a risk of the emergence of the esophagus ulcera when the tablets do not arrive immediately into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, correspondingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium butyl rate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore AMMONAPS should only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolism and excretion of sodium phenyl butyrate occurs over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) there was a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed ripening of cerebral synapses and decreased number of functional nerve endings in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least one undesired event (AE) occurred in 56% of patients and 78% of these adverse events were assumed to be associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old baby with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in an intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of surplus nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with urea cycle disorders can be thought to be produced for each gram taken sodium butyl rate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prediction of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaut, and the disease even led to death in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of elimination of nitrogen (sodium phenyl butyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenyl acetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns at postpartal (however within the first life month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated prior to the first appearance of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients it occurred with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the ornithine intranscarpathia-deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylacetate is known to be oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzyme with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied for intravenous injection of sodium phenyl butyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate in cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium butyrate in tablet form, the plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were observed 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urine retention or hemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable in the next morning after nocturnal fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenyl butyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted via the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium butyrate had no complained effects in toxic and non-toxic cans (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken orally (infants and children who cannot swallow tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or a gastroenteral or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenyl butyrate, correspondingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium butyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat-pipes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolites of phenylbutyrate), lesions were found in the pyramid's cells of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle it can be assumed that sodium phenyl butyrate of 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine can be produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and a further deterioration of neurological condition may occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granulate form 15 minutes after ingestion of measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring scoop contains 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon 2,9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium butyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine by means of a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium butyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogenous waste products, which accumulate after eating proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS because sodium butyrate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you should not take AMMONAPS as the medicine can go into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headaches, taste disorders, diminishing the hearing, disorientation, memory problems and a worsening of existing neurological conditions have also been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor or hospital for an appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stop uplift" (an anomalous measurement value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients with a PCI undergo a higher dose and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients were often given a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as rituximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without GPI administration - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as much as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, angiox was as effective in all indicators as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other pastudine or any other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that it is an acceptable substitute for Heparin in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd approved for the introduction of angiox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST uplift attack (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous intake of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in another episode, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery will be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements the reduced infusion dose can be measured from 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Just before the procedure, a release of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a sole Bolus administration of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance of low ACT values, the reconstituent and diluted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before the application and the bolus dose is quickly given intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds, further surveillance is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney dysfunctions (GFR 30-59 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second intake dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second intake dose is reexamined again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the administration of the Bivalirudine-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intravenous injection of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against brain dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe renal damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Although most of the arterial punctures occur in patients with bivalirudine, patients who undergo a percutaneous corona intervention (PCI) can perform bleeding during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudine, monitoring of the INR value (International Regised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with Bivalirudine is again reached before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytic or thrombocyte aggregate), it can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudine with thrombocyte aggregate or anticoagulant agents, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters can be monitored regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are inadequate in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudine alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudine plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unquestioning Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudine group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over the age of 65 were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleedings as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among Bivalirudine than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraarterial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point area, reduction of the hemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed hemorrhages occurring in more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" punctures, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose, or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side-effects are based on data from a clinical study with bivalirudine at 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudine group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over the age of 65 were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system categories in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the event of overdosing, the treatment with Bivalirudine is immediately aborted and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombal inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre as well as in the anion mining region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is present in liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudine to Thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin on its part slowly restores the binding of Bivalirudine-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudine with serum from patients with thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) did not induce thrombocyte aggregate reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients Bivalirudine shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory action which is documented by prolonging ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed on the patient, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin resistance is very small from insulin, and the change means that it works faster and shorter working life than a short-acting insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In a study involving 878 adults, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin resistance was observed after six months.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin or any of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adapted if administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH approval for the transport of Apidra throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose tolerance capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin demand in patients with a restriction of liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in the effectiveness, the brand (creator), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc retarded etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method may undergo a change in insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or abortion of a treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin belonging to another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of the occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the level of action of the used insulin and can therefore change when switching to the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, Salizylate and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, Sympatholytics such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reservation can be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and humanoid in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin secretion occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin does not enter the breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed undesirable disease treatments listed in clinical trials (≥ 1 / 10; often: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000; very rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the data available).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or trembling, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, dizziness, excessive dog-bearing, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy If it is neglected to continuously change the injection location within the injection area, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemics with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1mg), given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that action occurs faster in case of subcutaneous ga- be of insulin sensitivity and shorter working time than in cou- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin sensitivity in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg showed a proportional glucosity effect, and at 0.3 mg / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosity effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin release insulin has twice as quick action as normal humanoid and achieves the full glucosity effect approximately 2 hours earlier than humanoid.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that at an application of insulin release 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable post-denounced glycaemic control is achieved, as with a humanoid normal acting insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-denounced control than was achieved with a human regular insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin supplements are turned 15 minutes after the meal begins, comparable glycaemic control is achieved, as with human insulin analog, which is given 2 million before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin release medication 2 minutes before the meal was started (Figure 1A) before the meal was started (Figure 1A) and compared to humanoid normal insulin which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin release after injection of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the meal commences in comparison with human Normal-acting insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
