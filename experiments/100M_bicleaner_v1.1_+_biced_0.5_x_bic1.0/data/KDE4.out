package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
for more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions , see the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings to set up extensions .... open the Tools menu and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard settings from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that you may have more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras de@@ fi@@ lements . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if present , er@@ ase .
the module View filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web site . as pres@@ etting the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the M@@ IME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various tool@@ - and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ t@@ angle , whose surface is propor@@ tionally to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily recognized , can easily be detected if they are far below the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rec@@ t@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have meaningful color @-@ matching and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ t@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either display depth for the light detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file attribute , such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rec@@ t@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rectang@@ les is to be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rec@@ t@@ angle .
in case of representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always comp@@ lied with . frames are drawn to indicate the ne@@ sting of entries , and this framework takes place , which is then lost to the subordin@@ ate entries .
like split@@ ting the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to the implementation . here , it is possible for the inscription and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames always advantageous to divide the squares that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn to the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the image gallery , a dialog opens , allowing you to define the image of the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab allows you to adjust the title of the image gallery page in a text input field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option images per line has a slider and a turn field to set the number of mini@@ atures each line in the gallery .
to view the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , specify whether the fil@@ en@@ ames are displayed in the gallery in the thumb@@ nails .
to view the file size of the image , specify whether the file size is shown in the gallery in the thumb@@ nails .
with the picture size check box , you can see if the size of the images is shown in the gallery in the thumb@@ nails .
in the dialog box , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the file selection Save in HTML @-@ file , specify where to save the HTML page .
with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set the sub@@ folder with a slider to which level the sub @-@ folders are included .
with the check box , copy original images to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
with the annot@@ ation file check box , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nail images than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; html ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; html ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every media and card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , review and correct your photos . the editing skills can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
though &amp; digi@@ kam , it is easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; on camera or lens , which can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement options .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; attempts to report problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or desires report .... This opens a dialog with a broken link . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error report system . all information you need is already entered . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to join the user mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam . you can ask here questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . however , in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ code ; participation is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam . .
when you first started , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder here . simply enter your path name or click the folder icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your machine . here , the data collection is stored . this path remains the same for all the image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; you will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top@@ most folder , the images , as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam . see each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will change . during browsing the folder you will get a progress indicator as these :
&amp; digi@@ kam ; searches recur@@ sively the library path in all its depth . you can &apos;t close any sub@@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folder . this can be done by bar@@ bs &amp; digi@@ kam . you can do this by inser@@ ting a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put this on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can edit your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , it can also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help Win@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ Backup .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h decoder settings and raw processing steps .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every media and card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives .
digital cameras that support an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions over the serial port are slow , this connection is in the meantime out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the preview images of digi@@ kam can be reliably read . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ kam is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ plug ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide modules to all graphics programs .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam itself ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB , or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the tree tree , above the horizontal line of separation or in another application window . the only limitation is that an image cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common ones : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields displayed in the symbol view at the moment . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works when the symbol view is displayed . which fields are displayed , you can configure in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos that are managed by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were recorded on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ version@@ . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Import pictures to scan . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the pop @-@ up menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album features in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to select your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete new collections from collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by Date .
the buttons El@@ ders , A@@ verage , New Year : they set the date on that of the oldest , the newest image or the average of the album . to do this , first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first image in the album will be selected as a symbol of the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first photo is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview button . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be disc@@ arded .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the section My key@@ word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images in this album will be shown in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a little while the preview images are generated . this can help you avoid using the Extras All preview images in the menu .
information on each image will be displayed below the related thumb@@ nail . what information this is , you can edit settings . select the albums page and adjust the area preview images to your li@@ king .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter rest for a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the key features of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction to the main window shows such help window .
photos are all it &apos;s about &amp; digi@@ kam . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right button of the mouse and Edit ... . in the editing pane , you will find a guide how to edit your photos .
you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . the applications listed there are checked by the &amp; k@@ de ; file per@@ missions for the file type . to this , and how to custom@@ ize it to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing , other image editing programs can cause problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest is to click the thumb@@ nail to preview and rotate . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it is moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; postpon@@ ed . F@@ 8 Image dele@@ tion or De@@ f If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Un@@ f .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos according to the data . &amp; digi@@ kam which uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select one month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown .
photos with key@@ word provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a word has been assigned to a photo , the photo may be found by selecting this key@@ word or a search .
if a key@@ word is selected , all photos marked with this key@@ word will be displayed .
key words can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your key words lo@@ gically . you can also collapse parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word@@ list ; so that you can find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word or click on an existing key@@ word and then select a new key@@ word . once you have cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , it becomes the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and dropping there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be once in the tree at a time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the properties of a key@@ word by right @-@ clicking and select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit Key@@ word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
it can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a key@@ word , you can click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; . alternatively , you can also click on the preview of the images and select key@@ word from the context menu .
you can indicate a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the key words assigned to it . in this way you can give a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with key@@ word , this will appear under the thumb@@ nail of the image in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the pop @-@ up menu . the menu only displays the key words assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a tim@@ ately adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower rec@@ t@@ angle of the selection box , which indicates the time unit .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
when you click here , the filter will be cleared and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp will be red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you entered as search criteria . after saving it , it appears filters in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be performed . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search , select only the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you choose to edit search , the form for entering search appears again with the search information previously entered . if you choose to edit as extended search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the section The Tools for Advanced Search .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Del@@ ete Search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam &apos;s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules will be added to this list with search group / search group deleted or deleted from it . each option can be combined with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... You can also create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes every picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar . by using a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you move a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand color sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; finds the appropriate pictures . also here can be set a threshold value .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or move it out and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ ous in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The light table added from the context menu . the selection is added to the illuminated table and its window opens .
from the preview bar , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and place it there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select preview from the tool@@ bar and perform Zoo / Sli@@ ding operations on one of the images , then they are also executed with the other image . you can therefore compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use combination mode to navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas for compar@@ isons . now , use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to see it in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions work directly from the light table such as F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all picture information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to wave the visible area of the image , you must click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the preview mode , both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . just use the zoom @-@ control below the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom in . this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken until the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photographs collects , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we &apos;ll give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect , and use photos again . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers editing &amp; editing . we view the download , ren@@ ame , delete , convert , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Invent@@ ory takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , seeks , transforms , assemble and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , according to your definition , data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will need to find a certain photo without stock management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you will certainly not use &amp; digi@@ kam . the approach can store metadata in both a database as well as in the image files ensures very fast searches and secure archiving to which you can access other programs , platforms and formats freely .
the first thing you need to do and know before you log anything into your system is the structure of information structure as opposed to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you have to switch to a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday images can be quickly found over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant access of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files match ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation between original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend to save metadata in the editing page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the relevant item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what if you want to change them ? added &amp; digi@@ kam ; they have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now assign keywords , labels and an evaluation to any photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . it makes sense because you can focus on the best photos during further work .
let us now use keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam will ; automatically build the tree for you or paste the images to the right place . re@@ sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another .
this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to annot@@ ations or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want anyone to let your photos be seen simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dreaming , have associations , memories , the historical time span is present again , you may even hear the silence . therefore , the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others looking at your photos , the title is possibly more important than the image itself to generate interest . if you show pictures , you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help Him understand what you are going to understand .
it is al@@ right if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your pictures in web galleries , then these labels will tell you the story for publishing no second time .
remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation is already moving at the speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become even more po@@ ign@@ ant in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travel using images with geographic information .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a p@@ un with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ kam which should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , the name of a company or organization can no longer be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author title : linked to the author . this field contains the job title of the photographer . examples of this may be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you provide the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with machines can delete or modify this information embedded in the image . for private individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : plate error , plate failure , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , dis@@ semin@@ ated super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , they need to be treated cau@@ ti@@ ously and you may not dare to spend more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good dis@@ cos and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right ones .
CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors even if you are just written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection , they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disc@@ ur@@ ants keep your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s cre@@ ants include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the mechanisms of error of hard drives on this topic : flo@@ ppy study
electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT show the imminent failure . these are especially read errors and en@@ cap@@ s@@ als . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems .
while most electric devices do not make a lot of electric sho@@ cks , it looks different for devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects .
the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . but remember that not every plug @-@ in bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be aware that all peripheral devices that are connected to your system should also be protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection that also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in a non @-@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power ou@@ tage occurs . some models will allow you to save your data and keep the system shut down . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can get you for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your machine is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before going on holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
you are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ckr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies in the offer contain a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all trans@@ missions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs , at least , ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst part is that no one tells you when a transfer error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these interrup@@ tions remain und@@ et@@ ected until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data route than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . you will see thousands of mistakes in 2010 .
it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms that Z@@ FS is using and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebook and 46 % for work@@ station systems . not@@ ebooks already account for the percentage of thi@@ eves 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage than for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has not been seen for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most popular fil@@ es@@ ystems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical borders . it is meant that while the technology is evolving , there is a natural limit to this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
even DS@@ LR cameras have your fron@@ tier at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your fron@@ tier at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolution , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anyone responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive every day . if , then , one day , a flash will hit you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane crashes : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
for this reason , des@@ aster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups to the neighbouring house , your office or the like .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for data loss in spite of securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two times : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple sn@@ ap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup was made . this backup comes with a version@@ ing system closest to the exception that it is only sc@@ anned and not running .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
back up important images right after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this approach lets you discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for the backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
topics : metadata , stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving images and metadata , copying the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so that precious images survive the next 40 year , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noted :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available to everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area that you want to increase to a dedicated plate or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new disk has been recognized by the system but don &apos;t impose it .
&amp; Dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ t ; # operates with ext@@ 3 , FA@@ T@@ 16 , 32 and rows &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Excel if needed
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can be read , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
G@@ IF is a proprietary , patented format that disappears slowly from the market . therefore , you shouldn &apos;t use it any more .
P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard developed by G@@ IF . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is able to store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is inde@@ b@@ ted to use metadata .
this is probably one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block &amp; quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself .
many photographers prefer to archive your recordings , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw format will decay . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and place it all together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I assemblies , annual conferences and workshops , standard compounds and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , card reader or scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edit , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for an intri@@ cate processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ kam , then you should add the metadata again . these were probably trun@@ cated by the other programs .
protect the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them to web galleries , en@@ code them in MPEG , use them in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam . in the addition of a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ code ; use , connect these to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it will attempt to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ y indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nail images of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not show thumb@@ nails .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata of the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the metadata tab displays internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notes , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click to download and then download the selection of All . this invites all photos from their camera to a single record in &amp; digi@@ kam . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we suggest you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the standard selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download the selected .
if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . these images have been downloaded until now . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you want to download or download the selected buttons , a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed in the My Albums section . then select the album from the list and press OK .
after you &apos;ve selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only some , you have to select it first and delete the selected deleted .
note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . the photos will not be deleted in the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; they are completely deleted . so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded from the camera . if you want to delete the camera body completely , you should do this via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re @-@ used after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames in case you load photos of different recording series into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken in the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day is automatically created .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens up three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two will affect the data about the author in the default aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the edit field .
if you are using the option camera file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames into lo@@ wer@@ case when downloading . or in upper@@ case letters , if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo is displayed below the name the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the camera &apos;s orientation at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally enabled , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , it lets &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the extension button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date in which the photo was taken , can &amp; digi@@ kam . these sub@@ albums are based on the image data . all images with the same date are uploaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all the cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a section of the Met@@ a data section , you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually turned off , and in this case , it stores &amp; digi@@ kam the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option on . use the Advanced tab and select the Date @-@ based bottom line at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; edit ; you , where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select the folder and click OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in longit@@ ude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O , or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can click on a browser to display the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug , users who want to locate the location of the photo , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photograph .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first you should know that there are many GPS data fields , such as direction , se@@ at@@ rites and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical attri@@ bution ( manual ) and the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save these data in the g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ geographical mapping module .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from pictures and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the longit@@ ude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ iled coordinates , which are created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you as much control over its work processes as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you have to select settings in the Settings menu ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can change between these by clicking on the icons of the left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Show Action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; edit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on an entry in the main view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this page contains , as shown below , the standar@@ dis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields when selecting the option to download from the camera interface .
author title is syn@@ onymous with the subject line : this field should include the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the Autor@@ outer , it must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture to others &amp; quot ; an@@ biet@@ en@@ quot ; . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC @-@ fields . by doing so , it is achieved that metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam . this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam without getting lost .
save image cap@@ tions as embedded in@@ scriptions ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the labels embedded in the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cur@@ sor in the main window rests over a file . depending on the option selected , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam is tried , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions , of &amp; digi@@ kam .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update on the right of each category .
the settings of the brightness of &amp; digi@@ kam can be set to the default values . each time you then open the light table these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size la@@ den@@ quot ; you should only use on fast computers . if you have one then you can get better picture results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with a darker or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the more detailed explanation .
setting P@@ NG compression allows you to reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since P@@ NG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression .
the TI@@ FF compression option can be used to comp@@ ress the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on image quality since the Def@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just an image viewer for photos . currently , it is evolving very quickly to a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image editing .
the default is that all green pix@@ els are the same . if you use this option , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option distingu@@ ishes the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic ink balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the sh@@ ears . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top lights , so the parts of your images that are burned due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights , as pier@@ cing white . use the setting colors to create some unusual results because it shows the pointed shine in various rose holes . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of missing information from the sh@@ rou@@ ters .
this is possible because blue pixel is generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore attempt to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pix@@ els . of course , this is a question of how much colour or white you want .
if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each image individually .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ kam . to keep the time for the demo @-@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ invoicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pix@@ els . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reconstruction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ei@@ ty @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color sof@@ tening correction , since it is performed during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to get it back . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam . information like the color information from a color space in the other are to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files .
color Profile folder Find here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles .
settings of the ICC profile you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma doesn &apos;t correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the color mapping yourself .
there are other options such as the soft @-@ pro@@ of profile that lets you em@@ ulate how your image would be given back from a device . this is very useful before you can print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some color so you can manually correct this instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is pretty obvious which colour profile is provided with them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam can support many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ort@@ cuts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project via ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata into or out , which appears at the bottom of the images during the ad .
the camera properties show a list of all cameras currently supported on the left . on the right side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection that tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer .
at the bottom you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ code ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on .
if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them here .
with the confirmation dialog box for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can edit &amp; edit the video &apos;s conversation ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details in the delete of a photo and del@@ eting an album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be used tac@@ itly with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without res@@ etting . otherwise , you must save the changes with the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; App@@ ly changes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can also edit &amp; edit the display of the video &apos;s welcome screen ; under certain circumstances this speeds up the opening process of &amp; digi@@ kam .
hi@@ m start after new photos forcing &amp; digi@@ kam to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam . if something has been deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ code ; to adjust the main window to your taste . you can select these settings under Settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on previ@@ ew@@ ing a picture or by the contex@@ tual menu of previ@@ ew@@ ing and selecting the ad / editing item .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , displaying file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and current image size .
a menu bar at the top and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the picture .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ producing or using the Rest@@ ore File button Rest@@ ore the Image Processing button . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done in the photo since the last saving .
virtually any image processing action can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and remember C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressing the button or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the check menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ large factor automatically
view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can change it in the creation dialog of &amp; digi@@ kam . you can view it from the &amp; digi@@ kam window ; see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole phrases . whole picture preview pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select print wizard from the Album Export . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear and disappear into the margin .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
once you have commented , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the in@@ scriptions will then be saved .
in addition to the App@@ ly button , there is a button . with this you can also read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field of Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the diagram in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the key@@ word tree , and a selection box with the key@@ word used previously .
the key@@ word tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can easily limit the number of options when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
if several images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a sample with a key@@ word , please read the section Key@@ word filter .
the header Key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their Album , - Dat@@ - , S@@ word and Search @-@ views . if you add one or more key@@ word filters out of the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created key words are available .
you can also draw and drop off . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with key@@ word . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears , which asks you if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the top example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is written in no key words , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialogue asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be turned off under Settings Mis@@ cell@@ aneous .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be a or must , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and the rule area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an advanced search across all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I adapted it mainly to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors from your camera or scanner come in a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or post to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflow . the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management .
if your image workflow fulfil@@ s all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
their only other image editions are per e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use a different colour space and thus have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , check out Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor because s@@ RGB states that you ; on@@ itor to s@@ RGB so you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB colour , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic synchron@@ ization and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic Cor@@ rection attempt automatically to make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ osity values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot becomes as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
the same : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ous re@@ actor of the colour of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the same produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation , which causes either miracles in one image or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it identifies the dark and bright boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the entire hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wi@@ dest range and a new ji@@ us@@ port of all values in between . this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance adjustment is a little constra@@ ined since a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color is worked . if you can be too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the finish image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target pictures has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right , a hist@@ ogram is displayed that will change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit pictures , most pix@@ els have very small lumin@@ ance values .
the contrast of your results depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shade adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the controls mentioned above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result displayed in white balance . this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and load exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and rel@@ o@@ ad later .
the pres@@ et button rever@@ ts all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can set the depth per color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool will open the same dialog as used for processing raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be performed by sub@@ windows for the brightness elements . a detailed manual for using color profiles can be used to consult the color management chapter .
another important tool can be found in the menu under color tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , so you can use it for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct coating problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool color effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ a , was an effect that was created when a partial developed pressure was emit@@ ted by a short flash light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar synchron@@ ization . at approx . 50 % intensity the image shows what is chem@@ ically feasible . finally , a negative image creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . applied intensity lies at 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via &apos;s name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and therefore it is not unusual to change the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustment can be viewed in preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . in this case too , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform can be viewed in preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple light intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on tone correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the slide for the application explained here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controller and watch how the image changes .
on the right hand side , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful .
three controls : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for medium tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ sts .
the three color twe@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the compression of the output values can , for example , be used to create a hidden picture as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : using these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shadows , means and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pix@@ els and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you see an example of adjusting entry values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target picture will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , linear mode is mostly the most sensible . in this case , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with dark utter@@ ances and that the associated image pix@@ els are darker .
on the preview of the original photo you can see a red marking . if you move this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator monitors all color channels to display over@@ exposed pix@@ els . if pix@@ els are found in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun tones have been set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ kam . image editing is a tool to improve color channels or to change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of the image processing .
the channel selection box lets you select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison to one &apos;s own tab .
the preview of the finish image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you also activate the appropriate color components , since the channel mixer is THE tool for producing great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . color space consists of small noise @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the colour space first .
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can save you for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pix@@ els and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is shown in ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . in the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , because color images can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film rolling profiles .

green filter : simulated a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , in all scenarios and fits particularly well with portraits towards the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filtered : simulated a black / white film exposure with an orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filtered .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simulated a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscape and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm , light and middle tones while adding a little col@@ dness in the sh@@ aded tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aching a pressure and the re @-@ development in a s@@ mal pad . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ mal filter .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; applying tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the engraving of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right raises the impression of depth and / or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper texture effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) can be seen . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; add tool frame a decorative frame can be added to a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photograph is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scat@@ tering eye .
type : with this parameter you enter the desired frame type for your image . throughout the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white images ) , de@@ can@@ ted it with a nice three dimensional frame .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the finish image which is decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool After side ratio previously used .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any position . this also goes in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click &quot; OK &quot; on the button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool template you can put a template over a picture .
the Image template menu can be used in image processing can be used to place templates via an image .
for the template , there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you must take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the template , just send an email in English to the template .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder is set for the templates , a tree view appears to reflect the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . the selection of a folder updates the preview tool@@ bar of the templates automatically .
below is a preview of three buttons that can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this knob enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button drops the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK , if you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then automatically adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates gra@@ iny images especially in dark areas .
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it does not work a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process must be combined with minimal differences to a color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more later sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for the home users .
JPEG images often have a camera internal sharp@@ ness . pictures in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a sharp@@ ness filter while reading the image . if you de@@ activate it , you will get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with sharpen@@ ing of focus . you can use the menu entry for correction .
the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also strengthens the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for sharpen@@ ing an image can re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus it using the menu entry , for more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry , Con@@ duc@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter non@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values frequently generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount will boost the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of bur@@ rs might cause sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pix@@ els are affected by the filter on each side of a channel . high @-@ resolution images permit larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped picture added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount . thus , you can define a minimum difference for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ t and therefore beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the bl@@ urred mascul@@ ine filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . bl@@ urred mascul@@ ine was applied with Radi@@ us = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected det@@ ox @-@ filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna filtration . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focusing usually achieves better results as bl@@ urred mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding functions much better than the pal@@ atal folding . the pal@@ atal folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ els that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the F@@ IR indi@@ verse of the pal@@ atal folds is even very strongly influenced by the distant pix@@ els , causing un@@ desired results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should result in good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , and eg ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further ag@@ grav@@ ate the image .
g@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the g@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your bl@@ ur is g@@ auss . in most cases you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the g@@ auss &apos;s edge . note however that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to do all the trimm@@ ing , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before alter@@ ing the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but leave later unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read images and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , non @-@ sharp mask produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by bl@@ ur mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the bl@@ ur . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the ideal ruler filter . practically the result of the F@@ IR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods for correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regulator G@@ lät@@ te places the bl@@ ur of the area of the dark@@ ened area in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the color ink allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the in@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
if you want to fine tune the filter settings , you can use the smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detailed conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to smooth smoo@@ thing over the image . whereas larger values predomin@@ ate mainly homo@@ geneous regions and details must be sharp . please note that the detail maintenance should always be subject to directional dependen@@ cy .
directional dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes in all directions while a value draws near to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD noise will generate a high value wavel@@ eric pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ness factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore set this value to match the level of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is run . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle distance da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pix@@ els . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ness and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by selecting this option is minimal . it doubles the duration . therefore , we recommend it to om@@ it it .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Canc@@ el .
below you can see how image errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts can be corrected . the module is used on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the background that caused by a bad film shift during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ code ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other arti@@ facts from dust or ha@@ irs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be removed successfully with this tool .
below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window will remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smooth@@ ed over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller bugs fixed .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel pitch front of the filter to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer get image details and noise or for@@ ging occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can &apos;t be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ act without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the density tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ eplay tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically more noisy . however , it also mer@@ ges the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected value ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam site ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gra@@ ining , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ kon@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Artef@@ acts reduce : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compres@@ sions &amp; quot ; arti@@ ac@@ ts@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of photo @-@ restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo @-@ restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button .
the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film bas@@ kets on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photo that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that have been created by scanner and photo paper .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool hot@@ pixel allows to remove Hot@@ pix@@ els from photos with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pix@@ els are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw materials , as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixel .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ trac@@ tional method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pix@@ els . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pix@@ els due to CCD dysfunction .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark@@ room to the corrected image . automatic processing of the dark@@ est will find the bad pixel . note that the assistant will notice the last dark image and will automatically re@@ charge it in the next session .
the image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pix@@ els are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to see the defective pix@@ els on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filters method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pix@@ el@@ bl@@ ers . these are the filters available :
cut : an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined . the resulting colour is assigned to all faul@@ ty pix@@ els in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pix@@ els that have a distance of 1 from the pixel sheet are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faul@@ ty pix@@ els in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pix@@ els with a distance of 2 or less to pixel @-@ block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pix@@ els in the block .
cubic : all pix@@ els with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ ical surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faul@@ ty pix@@ els in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is visible below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo formats , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range equally . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
however , many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise imp@@ air effects are caused by movement .
with the wide exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color or gre@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation to an image without this filter .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target picture .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which equ@@ ates an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or by chance of a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , reduce it to compensate for a small degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting .
light intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pix@@ els . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the image using these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target picture , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam . image editing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distortion . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fla@@ ws off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth degree correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geometric distortion .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion 2nd degree . with negative values , barrel distortion can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameters &apos; has the revers@@ ed acci@@ dent@@ als of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image shr@@ inks .
bri@@ gh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog will illustrate the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start .
the cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before any changes or size changes . best perform this correction as the first one . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be obvious .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal line of help . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview around the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ ne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu Transform@@ ating cut out of the image processing or via the Zoom regulator of this dialog .
for most pictures the barrel @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motifs such as pictures of front , frame and paintings is the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate the infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ pick@@ up web site which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 i@@ inf@@ ra @-@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can set two parameters of film gra@@ ining and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . check the option Ad@@ ded Film gran@@ ul@@ arity if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of film gran@@ ul@@ arity and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows will know how snow !
since the filter mixes color channels for re@@ producing infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos because the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the sh@@ it@@ ters .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter Film@@ lining is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ producing film gra@@ ining on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver bas@@ kets of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ bbing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film faculty effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and style life are good for this effect .
the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brush is better for large images . smooth the smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processor is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size image is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon sket@@ ch . images of their gra@@ dient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you have chosen yourself to sket@@ ch out . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon draw filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter engraving informs your@@ image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing .
the depth allows you to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wavel@@ eng@@ es 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wavel@@ eng@@ es 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave @-@ blocks 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Be@@ ende .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image along Star @-@ shaped lines that go from one centre point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : bl@@ urred the image by turning the pix@@ els at the center point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a rotating camera .
sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to be back in the background .
motion bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image through horizontal movements of the pix@@ els . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : shooting from a car or train , camera .
bl@@ ur bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image by random shift of the pix@@ els and thereby simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur@@ ring : finds the color pool in the image and bl@@ urs it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and then recre@@ ate it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time by pressing the button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this makes it natural to your images a wet look . it uses an algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of the drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops in the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ code ; image editing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the range , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the rain drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it to the right orientation by mirr@@ oring or turning . in the menu , you can find the tools in transforming turning and transforming mirrors .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and sharp the details ? how can you zoom in a picture if the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transformation size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the tool for size modi@@ fies a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pix@@ els . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a more developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below :
preserve aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save As and Lo@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons are used for this purpose . every single st@@ all@@ ying for Photo can be saved as a text file and then re@@ charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take very long and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ ende .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by magni@@ fying a small image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . in order to cut a photo you simply need to create the rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rec@@ t@@ angle . you will then see this rec@@ t@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be gra@@ yed out . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by moving at the corners of the rec@@ t@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the blank , use the button The trimm@@ ing button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) .
in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rec@@ t@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the lateral format of the width is assigned .
the tool After aspect ratio cuts a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can see , for example , a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
in the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . relation button to cut the area to the wi@@ dest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the aid help enable you to hide help so that you can put your images together better . these aids are :
harmonious triangle : harmonious divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ t@@ angle aligned with similar harmonic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden mean : the golden centre is a division that focuses on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a nau@@ til@@ us shell or the flower pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things that we feel beautiful .
the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden mean . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides smoo@@ ther relief lines when you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow on this way .
a further rule are the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . this rectang@@ les are used to guide the golden spiral . it should be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles deri@@ ve from the golden spiral also discussed above . its verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break up your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles .
flip Horiz@@ ontal Fli@@ p and Ver@@ tical Options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can become invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle .
when you make a photo , it is easy to keep the camera upright or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing and the tool @-@ free rotation .
rotate your picture with the slide angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can reset the slider to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window .
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . once you have moved it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find un@@ desirable tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix it is to use the function Transform@@ ating cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is the Automati@@ cally cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after the turn . but note the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pix@@ els .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pix@@ els .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective the image becomes a little bit lubri@@ cated . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double @-@ strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get un@@ pleasantly tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming cut out of the image processing .
a horizontal line , for example , will shift the top part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not rotation , the picture is distorted . in other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transforming sciss@@ ors .
if you press pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed on the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the modeling tool to adjust your image .
after you &apos;ve done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image becomes a bit bl@@ urred . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two sh@@ ell@@ ings produce twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after lubrication , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cut out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries comp@@ iles have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Con@@ figuration section , you can find more information on this .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss @-@ free when specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw image format , read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter by &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of blan@@ ks only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw data formats by &amp; digi@@ kam .
many digital cameras support the recording of short movies . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display films or edit .

if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the White Balance module .
many tools you need to edit the image are available in &amp; digi@@ kam . your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft@@ marks , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , you can see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar indicates the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter to the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally split@@ ting without dup@@ lication . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane displays the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal divi@@ ders . the upper section shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch to show over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and disc@@ ard it on the part of the image you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data stem from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or move it out and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the p@@ allets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can either apply to the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ allets or search the folder by files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pal@@ let view . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described below the pal@@ let view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse at pressed left mouse button .
if the check box En@@ m Cur@@ sor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color chart on the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing has been selected .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for cli@@ p@@ board data : for each color , three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character , if another color follows . so if there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the color sel@@ ector output can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; programs that include &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; programs that include &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ ima@@ ge@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ ima@@ viewer ; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; posters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a modification of the graph in &amp; posters ; the graph is re@@ comp@@ uted and in &amp; k@@ ima@@ ge@@ viewer )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ k ; in a &amp; kate ; -@@ component to open
load large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and one h@@ ack to present more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs .
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . in the beginning , if you start &amp; k@@ ima@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window will only open the symbol file and open the ( empty ) list of Rec@@ ently opened files .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below , you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ ima@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings k@@ ima@@ viewer ; set up ... see also .
if you want to open a Graph@@ ite file outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphic viewer , open the instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; cor@@ graphic viewer , or if you want to display the graph in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice and change it later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split on several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph@@ ene divided on several pages without head@@ line and other font
the Renew@@ able Shop page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore changes ) or re @-@ en@@ qu@@ ire the program each time .
the opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the current session ) or determine that each time is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer . you can set a default behavior ( open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at any start .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose from different &amp; Graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Layout algorithms . the entries as described on the web@@ page of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ ic@@ ited graphs . it produces representation in accordance with the jumping model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a boun@@ ce model layout for non @-@ illuminated graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a lat@@ tice trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm ranks the k@@ not circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures .

the K@@ IP@@ I module displays images and provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your machine . select the source from which you want to fet@@ ch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default values with the default value . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the scanning button . the estimated file size will show you in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure the window will be displayed completely as some settings might not appear .
after pressing the scanning button , you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the image file will appear . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore create very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image .
you can create screen@@ shots once you have selected in the Import - &gt; Screen photo menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select The complete Desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected The complete Desktop , only the window under the mouse will be read .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay highly enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen shot is made , the dialog box options will appear with the options described above .

fli@@ ckr is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ckr it is possible to send photos to people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , put the photos of your camera &apos;s online and show your photos safely and private to your friends and family all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the module &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Export to Fli@@ ckr &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be used to upload images from your computer to a fli@@ ckr server on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . so it is your identification to Fli@@ ckr . a browser is started so you can login to Fli@@ ckr .
after the successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ckr website . you will be presented the following page after a successful application .
just close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ckr . this will be shown in the next section .
if the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ckr for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . at the moment , the module does not support any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button Add photos should be pressed once you have set any other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you click on the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ckr server will start .
the key field can be filled with a com@@ ma @-@ separated list of words . these are added to the image as key words during the upload .
with the options Open@@ ing , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie , you can set the access per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose the change the size of the photos before the upload , the photos will be changed in size before up@@ loading . size is taken from the value registered at Maximum Size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the image &apos;s metadata . geographic data is stored in the image &apos;s EX@@ IF @-@ keywords and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ o loc@@ alization loc@@ ates tools ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Gali@@ le@@ o . height , lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical location Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to create a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a log file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same time in the same locations as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is carried out which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera cell must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . put your camera time zone here .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation indicates an upper vari@@ ance for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from a location for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Le@@ ave this again and again until you have reached an adequate accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will en@@ code U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab allows you to select all the albums that should be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right side will quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the preview and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the Ap@@ pear@@ ance Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with other color depth . of course , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the preview images will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has generated the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore read the programs to see if errors occurred during production . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or moving on them . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse lists . he has been developed for quick image display and quick access to his functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual losses of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases as there is no compression of color information . this can be found , for example , in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the node @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the merge function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check out exc@@ l 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG En@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file to MP@@ 2 or WAV in the slide .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Slideshow . after that , you can start using Extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au to start the module .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio , where you can also change the content of the list .
the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to reproduce the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the created file under the name of the m@@ peg file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then it will be integrated into the film . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the film with the button coding . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go fast or in all quiet a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if a critic appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can custom@@ ize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the Settings button below .
print Wiz@@ ard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is useful for printing you or printing directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats of JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software is produced by your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file that should be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now read@@ just the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion results . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG is using a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to edit your images frequently or later use it otherwise you should not choose the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file is saved in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are secure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to convert all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image . in addition , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures to send before .
after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and place it in order to add it to the list of images to be sent .
with the button to remove images , the selected images are removed from the list of images to send .
once you have selected all the images , click the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only need to add the addresses and the subject here .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change settings for sending images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the pictures are added to a text file and the mail is enclosed .
the P@@ NG file format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in images file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ details will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , in search of errors , but your e @-@ mail program will run automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have displayed your slide show appears . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL output option activ@@ ates very elegant image transitions by using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File Name option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the left bottom corner during the presentation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop . you can then manually cancel it using Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option images random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
the time gap between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 milli@@ seconds equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test this before showing your friends !
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between the images chooses a different effect .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn it on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show .
at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Time &amp; Date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop environment .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can start with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; by this browsing , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords entries .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have annot@@ ated your images and videos . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images on which both persons are to be seen . by using this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view with preview images to view the images of your sphere of action .
in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; however , for each person to save a thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself .
to display images beside the name , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have a suitable picture for your keywords ) .
you must , however , define which image for each individual should be displayed . to do so , you need to select the image check @-@ in window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you visit the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for creating picture properties . you can view this dialog once more on the image .
if you enter a string in the field lab@@ eling or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can search all images by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here you see images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather try to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; and watch the fast entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; and select in the first dialog the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select Help menu entry photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the home page of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name says , this bar displays date statistics on the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed items previ@@ ew@@ ed from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will show you this date in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images as you navigate in the preview screen .
you can also select one area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ est@@ amps . if you select an area , in the preview @-@ view only images of this time are displayed . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline beam .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; provides two ways to create HTML websites with your images . one is available in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; the one is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; built @-@ in version is described , which you can create via the HTML Menu ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML @-@ file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can choose which information should be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information displayed to the viewer is obvious even without a description . for example , that all images are of a party . note that &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; currently all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look . most settings are clear , which is why this is not specifically dealt with .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download any images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified . so , he can search your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transfer time . if he wants to get a picture larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
in the best way , select a base folder for all your HTML files , and for each successive set a new sub@@ folder .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if they are really all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start after the pages have been created . the URL that you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you have to copy them manually there . to enable the import function , see , correctly , you have to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you just described have taken all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub @-@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; coming together , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; this work will not make again .
with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you can have all images together and share this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the file of the .@@ k@@ in file . if the images are not found , the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can export via the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is intended to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
in the manually copy option to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option in proximity of the .@@ k@@ im file copy copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images will be automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . because most images are already compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pix@@ els high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the Import menu ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the im@@ porting Wiz@@ ard consists of four steps . first you have to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is named in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window which categories of the imported file should be imported , and which categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step , you can balance the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture .
it must be easy to browse and view images : when you view images , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) setting up the information about your images , over ( 2 ) viewing and viewing , through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your images , but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual you talk about images , but often this includes videos .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal Backup Tools , to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and automatically re@@ use it for future starts . if you want to read another folder in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album , you can start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; with the -@@ c option , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ Photo@@ Album ; set up ... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; in the following section of the user manual you will find the different settings .
on the left you can see six different icons , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it has been described in detail how you can set different properties for each image , for example people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , e.g. objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in the dialog .
in the left half of the list you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ kam and g@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be called via the modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; however , they are sold separately . however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures .
the applications that the modules have in common with K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can create their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates for some modules order to albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture preview right now .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album needs to be released ; the modules also include a list of albums .
if &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry in this category is an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the preferences dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category persons , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; so do so , so if you would have selected people to view and share this with the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture , you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . currently , there is not very much information as you do not yet have any information about your pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; is the possibility to annot@@ ate any picture with notes . this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture , where the image has been taken , etc . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is illustrated and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all of these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments when using the built @-@ in viewer .
these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; they are a very important part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; since you will always use it again whenever you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on moving the pictures inside the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can , by that the names used are moved up , the people find and assign them faster .
if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the list icon by date on the list .
if you have any comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and annot@@ ate them with annot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons that are located under the thumb@@ nail of the picture on the right .
if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , it may be more convenient to select all these pictures and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window showing the USA as a sub@@ group . to show you that it is a sub@@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the Com@@ ment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or sub @-@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry into a category and place it in order to make it an sub @-@ category of this entry .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the Com@@ ment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that is the upper edge of the frame . you can also make an own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... , which offers , among other things , the possibility to save the current construction and look of the window .
you can also make a frame completely hidden . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the images in your browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not have a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply pulling the mouse down with the middle mouse button .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and select either the Rem@@ ove button or select Edit menu . now , the window appears you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you can also use images anywhere , so &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you can record the images anywhere , so &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images where the right upper corner is trun@@ cated are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 the preview images are present , so &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you can view the preview of these images . however , you cannot view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , you need to copy and copy files from the folders . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; do not support it until now . so if you want trouble as to avoid confusion of your images , please purchase a larger disk to save all images .
in the pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name Privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those who want to see your little sister open and click on the menu item Every@@ thing other than current view .
this way you have defined which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you have the laptop now of your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , so you can hide all the images you have locked . if you want to see the images again , click Lock to lift .
it is also possible to specify a password to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select the password in the privacy menu .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand all images are on the hard drive and on the other everyone can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this kind of password protection is only used to forbi@@ d those who deal with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; not very familiar to forbi@@ d the view of private images .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at it at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album features ; via a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see it . of course it shows the image , but additional information you have on the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info@@ box is on the top of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information should be displayed . all these options are available after right @-@ clicking on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and down . you can navigate to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slide show . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full@@ screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom in . to zoom in , you can simply move a rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse . the minus key zo@@ oming in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rec@@ t@@ angle is selected and shows the results of zo@@ oms .
with the key button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed out . with the key button sets the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work for videos do come in and zoom in with the plus and minus keys .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the picture . this does not work for videos . you can make comments to the current picture using the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can look at it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . you will perhaps prefer to select the image and look at more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer has the possibility to provide images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in , you see a picture with which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have added features to your images , they are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just add all of them at once with comments . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be viewed in preview mode . if you want to view categories in dre preview screen , then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be allowed &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not stored with the image but in the database . in the way you can undo your painted later .
in which you can see a picture painted on it . to switch on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; switch on on the image from the contex@@ tual menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; you need to master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully rule , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have necessarily read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click either the tool@@ bar icon or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu appears , so that you can choose the right position :
by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene before .
if you have modified properties , click App@@ ly to App@@ ly these changes . if you have typ@@ ed invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly , or disc@@ ard the changes .
if you enter the path to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with the help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already includes the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as pres@@ etting the entire texture is rendered even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local .
the screen@@ shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifting . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility stage of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as pres@@ et . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement or if you need another configuration , you can adjust it as you like . you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the mark to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the p@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the p@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the top of the tab in the views .
the last possible window arrangement is floating Vie@@ ws : views not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the p@@ asser on the desktop or click on the small left pointing arrow in the front panel .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the fiber strip . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
the current window view can be saved with view window arrangement ... Save . it displays a dialog where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it ren@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual has been written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 is current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene click on Ren@@ der@@ List icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View scene ren@@ ders .
a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to see the character of the mode .
in the map size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the section sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in the combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature look better .
when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray of pix@@ els . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling exceeds the neighbouring pix@@ els . the second method is adap@@ tiv @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is divided over and over again and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam of pix@@ els . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pix@@ els exceeds the given threshold , then both pix@@ els are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pix@@ els with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pix@@ els is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pix@@ els , which are followed individually and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generating noise for the beam process called j@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on j@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for rendering the rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental characteristic of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not made an object .
opens a new window for the display of the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finishes , you can find the reason here .
to import one &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; import the scene , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not the full command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting errors , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version here . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also add the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ t@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions separately .
if you res@@ ize high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering .
if you tick the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you view ground , a bottom is rendered beneath the objects . the bottom is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you activate channel smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more exact specifications on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page , you can change existing window frames or create new window arrangements . in the window instructions section , you will see how to create and save window arrangements .
the drop down sel@@ ector dialog box : shows all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all the existing window arrangements . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button removed .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Del@@ ete .
the position of the new window . with New column , create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with card card you will receive a map view together with the previous view and floating the view does not appear in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without a more accurate knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black image .
if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene lies in the dark and you only get a black image .
if you have installed everything faul@@ tless , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this tutorial , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edi@@ ting Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you click the App@@ ly button or the input key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert fin@@ ite body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; provides a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or the input button . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed .
the wire @-@ model view now also shows the level , though at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree accurately , you will find that you can expand the item for the bottom when you click on the symbol + before the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement .
in this scene , you should move the floor to the exercise one unit beneath the horizontal line , only so that you get to know some of these parameters . select a shift and adjust the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens , in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub @-@ object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you will see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the pigment preview only shows a matte black material , because you still need to add settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you do not see the color on the cube and the ball in the preview , click the App@@ ly button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now properly set . if you now render your picture with one click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select one @-@ color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to perform this step , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood the ball as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can change the settings immediately . set the value for the radius : click 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the floor as you shifted the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the next step , set a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the ground , give the ball a pigment as color :
select first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click Ar@@ sphere Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the screen@@ shots below and click App@@ ly or press the input button .
the brightness @-@ effect and reflection have already resulted in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered by you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er . hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog effects . thus , the scene is processed pixel for pix@@ els .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Un@@ do .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool@@ bar icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a jump @-@ map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model each diff@@ user individually on the surface and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel @-@ based , using an image file as a color card .
&amp; Ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select pictures to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the image size or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; Space Show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or return the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first characters of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the bottom right corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Di@@ alogue Classi@@ fier - &amp; Ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and Mach@@ ining and Sli@@ de Show , you can set the operation of &amp; C@@ ick@@ show ; set . in the two other short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the key short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full@@ screen mode .
if this item is enabled , loads &amp; dom@@ ine@@ Show ; already the next image in the folder while you still view the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; cur@@ d@@ show ; when moving the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; Ku@@ ick@@ show ; set up so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the small arrows on the right of the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the various modes of operation of &amp; C@@ ick@@ show here ; in the Car@@ sharing menus , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays great icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlar@@ ges the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; Ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
show the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the entry field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; image editing based on the digi@@ code ; image editing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .

&amp; show@@ foto , makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry to report problems or desires . this shows a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page for reporting problems and requests .
&amp; show@@ foto , is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ foto , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto . however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to join &amp; show photo ; to participate is to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ foto , tries to give you as much control over his work sequences as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto . to access these settings , you have to select in the Settings show@@ foto ; you can change the settings dialog by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the field of exposure indicators , you can choose the color shown when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should show the colors with what you want to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and exposure to a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto , has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in image editing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; gu@@ il@@ lite ; is an application to scan images that do not do more than scan and save images .
&amp; gu@@ il@@ lite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer ren@@ ders images to scan and save . &amp; c@@ anned ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of support of your scanner at the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this website : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; h@@ exag@@ lite ; with the command c@@ anned -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner can not be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner is opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; termin@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will stop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; gu@@ inea ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the full preview fits in the window .
if the image was selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you preview a preview in the settings , then the image will appear in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is cli@@ cked , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to a crash and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here .
the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case , the option Before loading must be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; h@@ exag@@ lite ; save images . open dialog for each image opens the dialogue before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; c@@ anned ; this will automatically save it with a generated name in a pre @-@ defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a file name to ask .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save option without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically storing images , and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix , each time a picture is saved . the character string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can custom@@ ize the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value while saving . if you do not select the image quality , then the default value is used by Q@@ t .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; gu@@ lite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; Sign@@ lite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; gu@@ il@@ lite .

&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; use like any other short@@ cut short@@ cuts . below are a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking on the player window and select global short@@ cuts .
you can set up existing multimedia buttons to work as a &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; short commands . this will make your keyboard a &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; and Amar@@ ok also has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dir to verify why a script is not running .
require require require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dir --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you &apos;ll find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the base for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most script languages enable the execution of external programs and commands . the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the default script entry . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default entries and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure Add the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is allu@@ ded to . the script could now and z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions further information can be retri@@ eved ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ build indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . to remove the menu , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. clean@@ up operations , such as storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration may also install script pack@@ ets that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which optionally can also be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will accept only script pack@@ ets with the initi@@ ation amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the other modules being loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can download it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , rather than having to browse through endless menus . perhaps you only look for a certain title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is smart , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re @-@ experience your music !
usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , it has some options to enable or disable the configure script at compile time . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compilation options , certain dependen@@ cies have to be fulfilled for them to be used . for details , see the system requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
to display player windows , the player window will switch to the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . the option switches on the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
save mood files from the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers use : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
playlist to save , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the playlist in the end .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , are used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces visible when changing the pieces , the playlist window will roll up / off to keep the running track in the visible window area .
when changing the item to the context browser , the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is allu@@ ded .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can custom@@ ize &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different type@@ faces in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; use the otherwise grey represented section . you can select scripts for the following area : playlist window , player window , and context browser .
with the choice of Custom color scheme , you even have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do this , use the color selection enabled for foreground and background color .
resume playback after restart causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; after starting the program , resume playback with the item on the spot with which it was stopped at the last exit .
set up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the option to custom@@ ize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . one click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors are used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen a multiple monitor environment is to appear on the O@@ SD .
the audio output card lets you select an audio driver from the drop down box . some drivers still activate additional settings in this chart .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to set up how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k to search for music both as well as their sub @-@ folders .
monitor changes : allows &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , incre@@ mental searches are carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k to add all the found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection .
the Compon@@ ent Collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is necessary in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l Setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; on calcul@@ ator : enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
us@@ ername : and password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the car@@ p card last@@ .@@ f@@ m al@@ ig@@ ns support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m ; &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations as required for the current piece .
here you enter your us@@ ername and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of the pieces played to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retri@@ eving similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , the list can be viewed in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no additional K@@ DE pack@@ ets . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD assume that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org , so Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can locate the file by typ@@ ing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
in most cases this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all libraries used by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , this will lead to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . turn off if in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically during a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a information , but do not label them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; file $ AR@@ GV &quot; &#91; 0 &#93; doesn &apos;t exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tags = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tags ; print &quot; Error while writing the tags from $ AR@@ GV ( $ v@@ 2@@ tags , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( chance mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects will be forgotten .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ lim@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to make Amar@@ ok the right version first .
most installation problems are solved best by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help from other users or the developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C on ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the # am@@ aro@@ k channel .
bow@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please bear in mind that there is only one fault if you have something about the correction of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; only appears a blank playlist . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start window was converted into the stati@@ stic window . you will find it under Extras stat@@ s .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist and select column View . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press release on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list to remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let them drop there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s simple : - )
in the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar , next to the Add button , the button playlist is stored . click on it .
probably you &apos;re missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also look for lib@@ tool , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar at Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses a back@@ end independent approach so the real question must be which media types G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and p@@ ng !
you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be included in the default setting ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 , paste button
launch the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to output audio simultaneously . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you search for the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( eg@@ . os@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; already . do not forget that media must first de@@ code . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers operated with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
in K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ am@@ ers respond to the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . perform registry records to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( stop Amar@@ ok earlier ! ) : - Download ph@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then , run the gri@@ m@@ peg file , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all the ff@@ m@@ peg files in the folder folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with the support config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . now , start &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
please report under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magical K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run it with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k player play
this command lets &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; start playback . make sure &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you &apos;re arous@@ ed by the gentle tones of music that you have stopped before bed@@ time .
how to get to know the current in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , if you are on a different computer ?
if there is a functioning SS@@ H environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ ip d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name am@@ aro@@ k player nov@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your us@@ ername with your us@@ ername . this assumes your identification in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA file exists .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k window ; press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent , in the size variable window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse @-@ mouse places a piece in the queue order into the queue . pressing the input button to search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky features , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers you want to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS mount . after the launch of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what happens ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / am@@ aro@@ k on a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click audio CD in the menu . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , take instead files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in essence , this adju@@ sts the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has each individual evaluation on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece just as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the item and selecting Edit : select R@@ ating or Edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the metadata dialog .
developers do not want you to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that does not match the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool bar . select Settings tool bars ... and take the changes you want .
download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click New Design to install ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation pane enables you to monitor and control &amp; am@@ aro@@ k while browsing in the kon@@ quer@@ or . then start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select the Add am@@ aro@@ k drop @-@ down menu .
audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information on which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free us@@ ername and password . audio ac@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k .
if you want to use AL@@ SA then please the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports are caused .
probably &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must re @-@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; newly installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you probably need a distribution that will install the development files separated from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . the same goes for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I receive the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set up Am@@ ok Settings ... audio output input the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here &apos;s an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 &quot; type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio } h@@ w : 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } &quot; &quot; &quot;
now enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the configuration dialog by x@@ ine , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check box on sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not take care of any further . you may , of course , gladly take this issue yourself into your hand ! if you want , you can become the new much needed advisor for Arts : )
listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the dressing assistant that is displayed at the first start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; if you want to update your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up and am@@ aro@@ k ; in a few minutes .
to create a playlist is very simple . drag the mouse entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field to filter the collection eases the search for certain pieces . if you are content with the playlist , you can save it by using the button playlist to save it . you will find this button in the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar .
if you have your own playlist , you can add them to the playlist . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the playlist to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view .
to play an audio CD , please select Pre@@ ferences audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD tracks in WAV format . drag the wa@@ v files to the playlist and then press the Play@@ back button .
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audio@@ CD : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function can also be found in the playlist . just right @-@ click on an entry and follow the Bur@@ n menu . you have several options for burning a CD .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; sets the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make working with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k more enjoyable .
if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. R@@ PM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , it also has &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; however , a playlist that is superior to everyone else .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k are used , including the creation of a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display that displays the current piece or current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current item . one click on this area changes the display of the remaining time of the play .
the player window also includes a selection of audio @-@ analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window .
under the running text display there are also the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window while the E@@ Q button is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play @-@ position @-@ slider . use the scroll bar to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preference .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you activate the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that there is not in any other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation pane . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail . they provide information on the current piece to different aspects .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you may notice that the sub@@ window has been taken away . the information displayed there are now divided into other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . besides , the information in the statistical window can be considered ( Extras stat@@ s ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . the title is the name of the song , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you see here how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
in order to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played instantly .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five most highly rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set what information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right @-@ click somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to begin playback immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages using written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running yet , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com based on the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing interpre@@ ts only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - In addition , the pieces are group@@ ed by performer and there is another division after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list below Mis@@ cell@@ aneous Artists .
group@@ ing artist / year - album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection will be alphabe@@ tically sorted by each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be sorted by genre and , among them , by performer .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically re@@ vise your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own lots of pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly beneath the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves similarly in the list view and in the tree view . in this manual , you can find information about using this filter in the section on the playlist .
under the search filter , there is a selection field with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you have different time windows available , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options .
load - This del@@ etes the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order into play .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this feature will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will make you play next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Ad@@ ds the pieces into the queue to transfer to the Media Player . for more details , see the Media @-@ Player Browser section .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - This will burn the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burn either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for item information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) Move files into the bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm that , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation , mark the selected album as a composition , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
undo the compilation - Change a compilation of the selected album back to a normal album . afterwards , the album will no longer be displayed under mis@@ cell@@ aneous artists , but once more under the corresponding artist .
the play@@ lists browser makes handling a lot of play@@ lists very easy . among other things , it also includes Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
even created Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart Play@@ list . you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window will be used for the connection of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod it must be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to performer , sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles out of the playlist and drop them on the list of Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . when the transmission is complete , quit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; and solve the drive connection for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file @-@ browser there is a address bar with which you can fet@@ ch music from a given URL . if you want to enter e.g. tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press input key , you can listen to music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop .
if the playlist becomes longer than in the window , the attachment of files by simply dropping can be tricky . in this case , holding the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag the entries by the mouse to the desired place and drop . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the button until the text field is empty .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms OR , search for entries that either contain one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this is the search for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search engine , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not include a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something searches for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and clicking the right button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button to add play@@ lists to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow undo and Rest@@ ore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the center of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the re@@ fres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you have displayed in the player window over the right mouse button . you can set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos; s configuration via this menu .
there are many more buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars ... .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about play@@ lists . it displays the title of the current item , the number of pieces and the total game time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed by clicking the mouse twice in the corresponding display area .
you can also hide the status bar , and de@@ activate the status bar option in general settings .
the context menu can be accessed through a click with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking the menu in the playlist . you can reach the settings of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k via this menu .
a click on this entry will open the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k .
this record contains a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information on &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in your collection browser .
the cover administration includes a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what to see in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your big move into &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , the playlist will appear in the playlist and the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre @-@ given ( the details to set up these will follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection , adding more random pieces while playing .
add tracks based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio c@@ ach@@ ers ) . this mode requires already some pieces to be in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double @-@ click the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then select loading . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pre@@ configured Mo@@ di Zu@@ fäl@@ zer@@ Mix and playlist mix immediately fill in your playlist and you can add at least one piece from your collection . the Recommen@@ ded pieces will be added at least one piece itself from your collection . the Recommen@@ ded pieces will be added at the end of the first piece , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button fills the current playlist and adds new songs according to dynamic mode . editing play@@ lists opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the ability to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be b@@ yp@@ assed and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . if the setting is active however , the already played pieces will be removed by taking into account the played pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each piece played . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings are already described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you res@@ ize multiple play@@ lists , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k will add random pieces from each of the selected play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can custom@@ ize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Con@@ figuration .
you can install new &amp; am@@ aro@@ k scripts , by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog where a script package can be selected for installation . once you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select the script to be deleted , then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to section Writ@@ ing Scrip@@ ts .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins are used to enable available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you need to create an audio CD . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compression formats then remember that when re@@ coding to MP3 you will get a worse quality no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ sy format .
in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this quick reference should show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with possible settings for burning .
after you have made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , press the button Start . you now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog box , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the origin@@ als are read into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you now have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you now have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . you can also get feedback from the forums and learn about news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio en@@ coding technology and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and En@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported .
l@@ ame : a sophisticated MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ code W@@ MA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a feature full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed with which you can choose folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file to save .
closes the current project . if a project has been changed and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can then choose between save and change . you can also ab@@ ort the closing and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you had called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project you will be asked what to do with it , as if you had called file clos@@ ets .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you select the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button Bren@@ nen , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above . what is the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you add files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session will always be included , even if this feature is not used . it is rather intended for you to see the files and folders available on the medium .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only displays the previously imported files .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later . also , there is also the option of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should also prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows the DVD to copy a DVD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy @-@ dialog is not supported yet , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
open the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , so the content will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog promp@@ ts you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not currently supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view but it can also be used in a single one . it contains information about the read video , coding settings , and even options for changing the size and cutting of black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and unlock the drive or disc@@ arding the medium .
the content view allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with an appropriate CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key signature to it below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct auth@@ oriz@@ ations for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the system administrator &apos;s password when you start the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general application settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and fine tune the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task is crucial .
in this chapter , we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then type something like the following on the console :
next to the General &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions to create new projects .
perform ( ) void copy@@ ri@@ f ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) .@@ void format@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volume e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files to the new folder :
a cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; ist ein Audio @-@ CD ; -@@ Aus@@ les@@ er for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s read and stored into MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and by many en@@ coding which en@@ code these wa@@ v files ( compression @-@ free compression ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ pre@@ v ( for O@@ GG ) or other en@@ co@@ ders must be installed . however , all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to install something myself .
which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to en@@ coder , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying a protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read audio data from the &amp; CD . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device avoids the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass any copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up has to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , then the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD will be explained later . this will ( hopefully ) lead to the understanding of the lean base of the user interface that you will often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . step by step , for example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
CD@@ DB will start CD @-@ data request according to the CD@@ DB registry . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
to start reading and - if an en@@ coder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup catalog - the coding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder than the default . it is to be noted that previously the en@@ coder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup dialog .
open the file manager so that an already read file is selected to code rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( like minutes , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( like read out the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the en@@ coder ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , en@@ co@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right en@@ coder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also others such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important since both en@@ co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless provided with most distri@@ butions , but there are open licenses .
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing equipment is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the unit . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R shared stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all tracks of a title . good enough for music from youths , portable devices and auto @-@ stere@@ os . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ K@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you insist on having absolutely the highest quality without consideration for the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or automatically fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audio creator ; and the en@@ coding program to create folder and file names , as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the en@@ coder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the en@@ co@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , adding the &amp; CD ; add title to the keywords when MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = click of a button in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs , so everyone else can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note the translator ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt . any information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio creator ; actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can not be used with another ( fake ) address than the one installed in the system . in this kind of configuration , it seems , the email address will not be used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the program@@ mer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio creator is set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online recall of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more exactly , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened .
pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added to the en@@ coding of the en@@ coder at first opening . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the en@@ coder package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined en@@ co@@ ders . more information on en@@ co@@ ders are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a co@@ dec , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading list on it and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio en@@ co@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step , for example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure about what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame may , for example , be found with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic setting up of &amp; audio creator ; something that is probably only done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the code to be used for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them every time you read a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the device desig@@ nations for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the Kar@@ tei@@ karte General Settings . there is not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only for incomplete information queries , so that you will be informed if data is missing for generating key words ( tags ) .
the Kar@@ tei@@ karte CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the computer while reading the &amp; CD ; to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second sel@@ ector is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; tags and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
if you want to manually enter the database , de@@ activate the selection boxes and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database beforehand . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as pictured in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls use the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , because the protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box .
just take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of concur@@ rent pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , so simply try it yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , check it out to check out the CD ; at the end of the process check out .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . if the field is not enabled , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something yourself using the .@@ WAV files .
to enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted when needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in the case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of WAV files to be coded at the same time : using a dual core or qu@@ ad or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one wa@@ v file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we &apos;ve just finished the basic setup of &amp; audio converter ; this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD . if you chose the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk runs . we will create and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been set up in the previous section as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from those for one &amp; CD ; with succ@@ es@@ ful of fre@@ ed@@ b de@@ for@@ ested data . therefore you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually , rather than pick it out of the internet . comments will indicate the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD will be pushed into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , then locate the questions and answers section after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the songs are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album is displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but get data from the Internet , you will need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the item in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; input field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist no longer needs to be entered in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; field unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bottom comment field can be used for individual comment@@ aries per item , the album &apos;s comment field is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , Album and Tit@@ le of a piece and only 28 notes for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audio creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information from the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all en@@ co@@ ders and file formats . see the help of the en@@ coder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the exported CD . in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click on the row with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current item .
click on the next row in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the BO@@ M .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
if you click on the button selection to read out the reading process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
on the tab , click the order window to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
you see this error message when trying to work with a code you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully en@@ coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have read access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 in the format MP3 . this allows you to read and en@@ code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
now the last title is read out while another piece is coded and a third order in the queue of the en@@ coder stands . after the last piece is coded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the en@@ coder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; runs today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the multimedia package . however , if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy there . most distri@@ butions , however , already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you have probably already done it ...
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many options on settings . it &apos;s best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different mapping cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication as it will continue on from this empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? those who read this have probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audio creator ; if you want to add or modify something useful , may it do . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal .
strange if you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke player of &amp; k@@ de ; beside others it also has real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke play @-@ time up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
session support . if you quit &amp; k@@ de ; quit while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the l@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( multiple pieces will be added to a collection and then played one after another . )
once &amp; mid ; a piece plays off , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth using the regulator .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the template and change the playback speed . in order to restore the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ p LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the Pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events should be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined using a song , so you don &apos;t have to set anything manually . in the Settings menu , you will automatically select the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up an event type , select the text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze . these are played by the turn . in this section , you can see how you can use your collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find these in the collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on the copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set each of them in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to no other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . remember that if you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the button Add . it will again be the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic Add to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when you open ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button forecast piece , the entry of the item from the menu item or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter as it will not be stored when you leave &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map implements General MIDI events in events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that converts all the events of type Change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all the required implement@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequis@@ ite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section describes how to map the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the same sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and do not leave any line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a ri@@ fle shot ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun@@ fire .
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( ri@@ fle shooting ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , no matter what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch where each note is a different percussion instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ ac@@ as , etc ; ) and not the one where the tone signi@@ fies the pitch of the ever @-@ same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate sounds on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . take a look as an example of the provided key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and the second channel , do this in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for keyboard players who have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the Channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be defined further in the file name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is where Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this will be converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that there are no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM states that a keyboard which receives a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the Settings menu , item MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are currently being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to show the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the dot channel view : settings
the tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually .
OK , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enable automatic add to the collection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Automati@@ cally add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ p LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a Kar@@ aoke file ) or tack@@ ed ( if I want to play a Kar@@ aoke file ) , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn automatic add to the collection , and the new one ; file is added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; LA@@ GA ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; LA@@ GA . at the moment I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; LA@@ GA .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , bug or idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy simply write to me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me , since I might have the file already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and doesn &apos;t get any money from anybody . I would like to emphasize that I only program because / when I receive feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Fix the defect that the pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .

and of course my thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at pictures . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have a sound@@ card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound@@ card , except that you can &apos;t hear music of course .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Ma@@ iling lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and ph@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s , TV and camera .

for additional help , check the page The K@@ DE Website for new versions , or send the question to The K@@ DE ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . there is always the window with the playlist . and finally there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that is only displayed when information is added .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . when you add an entry , your group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback will begin with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not run . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / K@@ M@@ Player directory can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you have to select the matching playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the edit mode is abandoned or another group is selected without equal to the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / expl@@ orer / K@@ M@@ Player / K@@ M@@ Player / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be disturbing at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bu@@ gging is the &apos; console &apos; button in the K@@ M@@ Player tool@@ bar . here is the mp@@ layer output .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even be added to the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to play the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash can be specified in the setup dialog box Direc@@ tions of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to the loading of the browser module library . if no errors occur , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( View , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that always a given back@@ end for a particular mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this needs to be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards using either M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog can be found in the Settings under - &gt; Source &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the coding to be used must be found ( e.g. it &apos;s PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b contained in it .
since V@@ DR &apos;s V@@ DR support can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux expansion for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , it must therefore contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , various names are used by K@@ M@@ Player . at the time of the creation of this documentation dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , they begin playing the playlist .
are there hints how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to be run as root after the device is inserted . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why do I have to check my CPU for performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine checks the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is used to compile &amp; Ki@@ le ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ ing application . under Unix @-@ like systems most likely relies on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; -@@ distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution and / or installation CD / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the Ki@@ le ; website .
this manual is for everybody - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the box should be made .
if you have any questions about the compilation of &amp; Ki@@ le , or if you wish to add extensions , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . furthermore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the possibility to complete , compile , re@@ work and error searches within the source code as well as conversion and monitoring tools for this . finally , the easy to use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to learn its possibilities the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly by reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right exit : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( eng@@ l lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . to properly handle &amp; lat@@ ex ; good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the initi@@ ation contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick entry Wiz@@ ard from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an useful feature for spe@@ edy creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the assistant ( menu ) offers some possibilities for creating the document .
document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
en@@ coding : this is set to set the character en@@ coding . modern systems increasingly use U@@ TF @-@ 8 en@@ coding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for the correct processing of the lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they have to be selected only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ matched ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see gray areas of a gray text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the corresponding line for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu item Ki@@ le ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allow the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files , the back search function can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; rendered independent file &#93; &#93; is created , jumps &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the usual output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are plu@@ gged with the editor and once cli@@ cked on an element in the DVI ; file , the corresponding section is found in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is the exact opposite .
master document : this function is used in working with several files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings .
express : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there is any error in the source code ) .
video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is opened on the side of the door . it is not called a &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection boxes have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for spe@@ edy arrangement of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the division are :
the choice panel Fur@@ ther is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , notes or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a term for a section , a picture or another element is created .
refer@@ ral : used for reference to a specified designation ( choose a selection field possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size . the written documents can be specified for the main text , the gro@@ o@@ ves , etc . the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and restric@@ ting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font name . if the font name is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or the button &apos;s Schnell@@ bau .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically removes the storage .
failure to compile the document should be searched for errors in logging . when using quick construction &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font name 12 will have created and only a few sli@@ ts should have another font name . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ our and \ \ end { environment } allows then to change the font size inside the environment .
the changes are considered only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restrictions ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , grease pressure , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the itali@@ c print and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be displayed recur@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : created a quotation in the document . the quotation starts with \ \ start { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
following the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; label language , then follow a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , at least one quote , a few passages in bold and itali@@ c print and a poem for application should come to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed ( in the viewer ) by means of file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar allows conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preview search allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . to do this , only Modern will have to set up under Settings boxes ... Building tools .
in order to execute the pre @-@ selection search , the mouse cur@@ sor has to be positioned in a line of the source code and then click on pre @-@ select search . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; the viewer is then made .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; opened and bound to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; set up as text editor ( setup ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
if it is not possible to open the &amp; DVI file , an error can be found . if an error is present , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log message file explains the error source in the source code . in the editor , then the short@@ ages of the La@@ Te@@ X errors and gaps between the errors can be used . the log files always specify the line in which the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , the error in the log file must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the wrong line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document may be written either from the ground up or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section .
common user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file will be created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character en@@ coding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Settings .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by typ@@ ing in the document class . typically , it is used as follow@@ ings : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , you can then choose your own template instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; Colum@@ ns ; as an internal editor . &amp; Colum@@ ns ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different kinds of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; posters ; and to experience its possibilities the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly by reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search for different kinds of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional jumping marks . this is a special kind of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entries edit ho@@ cks or the appropriate key pair make the jump to the next or last jump brand . this is also highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; though &amp; kate ; already offers excellent opportunities , were added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code added . &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection .
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only beu@@ tiful thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the Ab@@ s@@ esses are separated by two empty lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also applies &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a back button ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for the length of a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the button . &amp; Colum@@ ns ; offers the key @-@ key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit , the following commands are included to the text of the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed right in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environmental commands , you can quickly get lost in view of the environment . this command will close the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups defined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed right in front of the cur@@ sor bracket .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed right behind the buck@@ led clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex ; group # is spra@@ yed to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
at the input of many dis@@ advant@@ aged groups cl@@ amps can quickly get lost of the view above . this command bu@@ cks the most recently opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple quotes are used as a seal . for the appropriate implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the character is used for two simple quote characters . also for moving the application the sign &apos; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and applies two conclu@@ ding quotes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; a .
this automatic inser@@ tion of double mit@@ re characters can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
foreign @-@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) can also be used for German or French quotes . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift , En@@ tries button &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the command \ \ item .
within a table environment close &amp; ti@@ lt ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with a close line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to make this possible .
all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings box . all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings box ... All these modes can be set .
when starting a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and this will allow the completion of the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , it can be added by &amp; Ki@@ le , so that a simple jump to these positions can be added to these positions using the jump brand N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste jumping brand and then the desired parameters can be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Con@@ fig file can be made settings to these lists . you can select different lists of lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as text editor of the general language used .
the command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call for completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of environments .
when calling the completion mode over the menu item Res@@ et environment or the key @-@ key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment will be automatically added and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient completes can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item -@@ command is added .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Con@@ fig file can be made settings to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion mode for Fron@@ tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which can be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sions are set up . as an example of a query list , the file is ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word completes queries over the menu Edit Ver@@ sions or C@@ tr@@ l C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Space bar , the letter L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large flas@@ hes are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noted that many bugs in a document are written more than once .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sions are switched off . here , the threshold value for the display of completion can also be specified .
the files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the native home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialog boxes design the inser@@ tion of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphic formats , the sections should be considered and considered .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
in order to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed together in the menus creation compile , Cre@@ ating converting and creating views .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used by pressing key Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file by means of the Alt ; 4 ; 4 the DVI ; file can be viewed in a PS file and can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Schnell@@ bau command , a viewer is normally called after the compilation . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time .

the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be administered over scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods :

&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . they contain a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands contain and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ Live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all files &amp; boxes ; provided documents and this for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the most important advantage is the search for package names or keywords . of &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .

everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it another piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; just click the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the prompt working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder you want in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time you get started .
as already said , everyone who has already worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphic interface for it .
if the currently opened file is inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then simply select the current working folder . if not , select current working folders and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to a output on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported bugs and try again .
if the file to be checked is already tagged in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file can be simply sn@@ apped . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be reviewed by other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the Well @-@ formed Check option .
for the use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; -@@ processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already selected , then the current file can be simply selected . if not , remove the selection up @-@ to @-@ date file and select the file to be processed using the other file cho@@ oser .
specify the name of the file , as the result should have named , and the file is usually stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality at once and do not have to wait until someone builds the shared in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe every &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a memory location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often on one project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift , F@@ 7 Project Properties Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can search for himself from the list of team members who he is . this is done by selecting the team member from the list and hitting the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold as they are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for further information on comments .
besides the overview of your team there is another benefit by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to be created to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much anyone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that will add a file to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Pre@@ ferences dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see how such guides are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
inser@@ ting notes is simple . either the annot@@ ation entry can be selected from the Editor context menu or the @ annot@@ ation key@@ word can be entered in a comment section , followed by annot@@ ation text .
comments can be sent to a defined member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ annot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ annot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name of the nick@@ name of the team member is , role plays a role in the project from the following possibilities :
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive regardless of upper or lower case , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the : make the comment invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog covers some pages that are treated consec@@ u@@ tively .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags including car completion can be modified with this . entries are :
tags : big / L@@ ump@@ y of tags : big / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal wholesale / lo@@ wer@@ case meaning tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
upper / lower case sensitive attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case meaning the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if checked , tags for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for ordinary tags .
automatically update start and finish day : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacing of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding code during typ@@ ing .
M@@ IME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the default button , the default settings can be restored .
standard character en@@ coding : the en@@ coding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the coding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been recognized . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; periodi@@ cally creates backup copies so that the document from this backup can be recovered during a power failure or crash when the program is launched . this is not the same as saving the file .
previ@@ ew@@ ing and docum@@ enting can be displayed either in the Editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the default window settings at the next start is useful when the user interface changes by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / app@@ ending views . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning noti@@ fications area serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hook from non @-@ requ@@ is@@ ites .
the place to modify the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source view in shared mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the representation of the Par@@ ser node in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the field of mouse click on the structure tree , it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structure tree settings area , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree during editing and how deep when changing the structure tree can be automatically opened . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause canc@@ els something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
plu@@ gins are part @-@ applications from a third party , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , at the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when past@@ ing a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not at a default location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the related folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Read @-@ Only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is checked , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the input information is correct , it also allows you to save the input even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gging was completely new . support for the no longer needed built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations of plu@@ gins .
currently there is only one plug @-@ in available that adds support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session Star@@ ted the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or stops listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ u@@ gger Edition .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variable as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution is continued . if it happens before a de@@ bug request has been started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next statement in the script without entering into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next statement in the script , where it is possible to clean up in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for brand and script languages as well as c@@ ss ; their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contains two file types , the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbol @-@ oriented tool@@ bars of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , the text and instructions are more quickly inserted into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML Files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and the content of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day displays . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars enable a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without the risk of a writer .
tag Fol@@ ders are nothing but a folder . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but the only element type over itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a just element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface name and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag which groups the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the attribute text position within a dialog . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but be careful &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check only takes place when loading XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following an example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ e. tag .
in the following an example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D mach@@ ete DT@@ D settings . with it di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = distortion 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D @-@ specification . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can set up actions with Settings ... to be created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
this action short@@ cut short@@ cuts . by clicking the user defined button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ ONE , the current key short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the Det@@ a@@ ili@@ erte settings and if the action is executed , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but on that it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is trying to find the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are sub@@ stituted with the current document URL . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the unique text will be added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods en@@ umer@@ ated above , a script from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be used to receive the default entry . in the input field you can specify what is to be sent to the default entry . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard error output . it can be specified what to happen with the text written to the standard output by setting the value in the output selection field :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in any given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select settings to specify actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window opens the Edit mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the Tag has attributes and you are planning to use their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available so that an input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ cs Other Program@@ s ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pix@@ els , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size other .
please note that the created icon not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with the view that the day starts , I have decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly seen as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; star@@ t@@ gt ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue using other tags if there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar , or you should set it to a better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bar to set the tool@@ bar settings dialog . make sure the tool@@ bar is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar might think that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar has to be tested by ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ating all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
save them to the right folder . after Reb@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please match their descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation to scrip@@ ting language or the format language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if anyone has done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
&#91; source &#93; Doc dir = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93;
the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference La@@ unch = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the box depth ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently on the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be shown ! ) .
spaces don &apos;t affect anything , but be careful &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
the content portion is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to form context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts documentation for my@@ sq@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function would be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements separated by conf@@ using ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local / global use . then create a folder ( as you specified this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that this is good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the lost resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else to whom . at different places there is an email @-@ send menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) send with email , send tool @-@ like tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the Scrip@@ ts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions will be reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . in order to make an annual contribution , we recommend that the source of resources is ensured , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key after your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New Resource Dialog you have to fill out the input fields ( URL template can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders can be started in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is supported to work by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . however , creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is a simpler way to convert DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D load and convert a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions : the string that appears in the ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; templates to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ gli@@ des the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the building views , the flash@@ cards with information and tool@@ bars . please look in , and for more information about these areas .
you can click the mouse button with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all of the car@@ ts , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or exec@@ uting CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor area will lead to a further context menu on the edited document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / past@@ ing / past@@ ing ) , editing the tags under the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file , if the string under the mouse cur@@ sor is a file .
at the top of the editor window are the tool bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as default , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new features and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; P@@ GT ; insert into your document then click on the icon which represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( like ar@@ mature ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and ro@@ am . in the display with car@@ p controllers are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation of building views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading , or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be done using the context menu that is displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; It is open to you all possibilities .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the appropriate user and templates in projects are available only in the project .
here you can find information about the scrip@@ ting languages available . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the information available to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the information available to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking a element , a list of commands is opened with regard to navigation and re@@ fres@@ hes the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , man@@ quick attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the entry system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two car@@ ts at the bottom of the window that can be accessed through the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will see the corresponding command . the tool@@ bar &apos;s cho@@ col@@ ates page is the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the site of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in PA@@ TH in front of its bin . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a host of powerful features .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML , developers from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now widely on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; node ; developer community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good application of free software , the idea of Why Dev@@ el@@ op what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework not only this is possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ knit@@ ted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is not in any way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of the documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or run help@@ desk help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and looked after by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Se@@ quit@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick @-@ access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry being taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project templates , only one error is reported .
converts added characters to &amp; html from cli@@ p@@ board inser@@ ting there , so that they display correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
convert the text from cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost , to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the Anker Day .
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP script exec@@ utes error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
turn off and switch the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the tool@@ bar on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Forecast or Next , depending on the location of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
open an existing project from disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables you to copy graphic files into your project folder or sub @-@ folder , and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available modes of transport depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in Chapter &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , details are explained .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the tool bar type : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar , which only creates the name . actions must be set by settings ... to be added . tool@@ bars are saved using tool@@ bars tool@@ bars , or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
allows the loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; . makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be re@@ plen@@ ished without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the store will fail .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ) tool@@ bar is loaded , in the Tags menu , there is a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the Tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied when this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
sel@@ ects the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the posters ; -@@ version .
choose the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes may need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that matches the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the appropriate sub@@ window .
to@@ ggles the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
the changes in this dialog influence any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate ; see the details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or add which ones and change the sequences .
this should generate a help according to the mouse cur@@ sor environment , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , as , for example , after filling the project name , the entire directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift , F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project to be entered , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . you can select multiple files or entire folder .
this setting is great if you have the static content you want to download and change . in case of server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be ha@@ iled when files that are located somewhere in the project &apos;s main folder . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder , and you can make an accurate selection of gut@@ ters .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the sub@@ window profiles or Shift key Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) that are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , even files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
in the Pro@@ files section , Up@@ loading Pro@@ files ( see below ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , by showing its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration window , you can switch to event actions and add , modify , or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a certain event occurs , such as the backing of a file . see the details .
by default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . you can &apos;t currently influence this behavior .
to open another project , select project open ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before you leave when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders are also behavior , but the entries open and open with ... in the right mouse button of the context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by the program@@ mer . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password on the disk drive option is not in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use it at your discretion . the password will be stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the project menu or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool@@ bars Project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to its own working method .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best stack@@ able above the tool@@ bar menu . the addition of tool@@ bars is discussed below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols on it can be set either using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , it can move other actions like tool@@ bars , ren@@ ame tool@@ bars , or set the tool@@ bars to see which actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and activated actions that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the Settings menu ... and set settings for actions .. set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; commonly used templates such as a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you set for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each presentation prior to use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in the template @-@ tree among global templates .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and arran@@ ges the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template @-@ tree among global templates . see for more information about the Tem@@ plate tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be included in the documents again and again . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure as you wish ( XML ; , &amp; HTML , , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File as a template save as a local template ....
as soon as this happens , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree .
select text in your document and click File As template to save selection as local / project template . alternatively , you can simply drag and drop the selection to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as drag and drop or paste over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
in the file tree or in the project files , you can click a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically link with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files , or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , click the folder and right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as el@@ event@@ ual attributes are ero@@ ded .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the master folders in the template list . if a root folder is set in a way , it would de@@ activate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows prior or provided text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for a whole presentation to be presented with the appropriate he@@ aders and foot@@ ers by copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor , which is accessible via the View menu . the first mode sub@@ stitutes the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and switch back if necessary to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor on a document that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green icon displays the V@@ oh@@ and@@ rite of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; in order to edit it , the source text editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible in both the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor in syn@@ ch@@ ron mode . pressing F@@ 9 mode will activate this mode , pressing the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta . depending on the choice of V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow ones .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . this allows you to edit invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog will also be called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this will help to reduce the en@@ coding process .
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list makes it possible to change the contents , e.g. keywords on the Name and Key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to design your pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS @-@ rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements .
it is possible to include an external CSS sty@@ les@@ he@@ et by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the file .
cur@@ sors are used as in a word processor , by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves in a peculiar way . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted using the back button or re@@ mo@@ ver button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way over the tool@@ bars as in the source code editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an ar@@ mature day , surrounded by text , must be removed from any other surrounding ar@@ mature day .
some tool@@ bars such as the table assistant or the Listen Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will work later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .

on systems with installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll through the arrow keys of the commands previously executed .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ isons . so why &amp; k@@ not 3 ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ vil@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , lots of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , just copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it into one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( base ) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ vil@@ 3 ; also helps you to merge and merge all folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the merge merge :
&amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if no one changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , you can simplify the typ@@ ing by simply typ@@ ing out the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ v@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
opening dialog allows you to manually typ@@ ing fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . opening dialog records your selection and shows it again next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed .
via the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or merge of folders will be initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C however a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders .
if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can do this later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here , you can set options before starting to merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ vil@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in open dialog you don &apos;t have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag &amp; drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort .
note : currently you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ vil@@ 3 ; only the drop down of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag &amp; drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the Info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest over the line for a while . then a small help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you see the color which differs from the file . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) well to see .
in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases relevant . )
the vertical line separating the abstra@@ ction column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is displayed on broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparison window ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changed &#93; when you edited the result . usually , it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to find next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is also a conflict that must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps again choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a selection that you may copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources Ign@@ ore the options numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters .
navigate in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , high , down , side to side , end , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the display window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the inser@@ tion key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the Mer@@ ge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Down / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the flag to the cli@@ p@@ board , you will need to automatically copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ In@@ sert ) . if enabled , it will automatically copy whatever you mark , automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board and skip the manual copying . be careful with this option , because you may accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed \ \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; not using bin@@ aries .
the options and list of recently used files will be saved automatically when moving and restored to the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 Set ... )
choose a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialogue also provides type@@ faces with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be sc@@ anned . on these systems , the knob tigh@@ tens automatically an un@@ regulated color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ l@@ ator character will be inserted .
if you press input or return , the input of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . then , the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board will be om@@ itted .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ vil@@ 3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others in turn store only one line of line &apos; \ &apos; . usually , the default will be disabled . if this option is checked , this option will be disabled . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in Automatic Continu@@ e Mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict continues .
this is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are discussed in the section on scanning of folders and performing a merge . see for details under documentation on directory compar@@ isons and merge .
if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you must quit and restart , so that the change becomes active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following en@@ coding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
above the selection fields for coding , a short notice appears , which is the local code . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
custom@@ ize the file en@@ coding for source files . this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted . since coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you &apos;ve edited a file , you can specify which coding to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) With this option you can specify the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn off this to supp@@ ress the emphasis of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded title column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . by selecting A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will appear next to the normal one second over@@ sight column with the information you need .
sometimes you &apos;d prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . just leave the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison window side by side or above each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et names for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first pass to this external command . in &amp; k@@ vil@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your needs . you can use this feature , for example , to cut off disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will first pass to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command was specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to provide the user with more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
* \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all of them follow the same pattern $ key@@ word generated text $ . now , the \ \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line comparison . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any hit will be replaced by nothing , i.e. deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ stitu@@ tions . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for displaying and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the line @-@ balance algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases , if you are using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you inad@@ vert@@ ently fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate mer@@ ging and display the simulated changes without actually performing them ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you just have to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog box .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , it uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start the merge , select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the folder of the folder , only the files listed until then are listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ vil@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for the left / right . the list menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories can be opened , and all sub@@ directories can be opened with which you can unlock all folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed of any problems of this type .
as can be seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . at folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying of B ( or if B does not exist , del@@ eting the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copying of A ( or if A does not exist , del@@ eting the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the synchron@@ izing mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified , and if the option directories are syn@@ cing , then choose &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders will be identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the New File instead of merge , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the same date appears , then an error message appears : files are identical , but the date is identical .
while mer@@ ging , a file is processed after the other . it status column displays he@@ el when the merge succ@@ eeds , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only shown when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( including all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you did not specify a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode C is used as the target , selecting B as the target for two @-@ folder merge operation , and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , also displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by the particular entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the menu menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears that points to the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with the options Open@@ ing , Simulation and Canc@@ el .
select em@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the actual changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge @-@ window ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select the directory merge again / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ vil@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if you lock the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you choose the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , it lets you select another action for the entry or to resolve the problem in a different way before you continue to merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , the entries ( in the current session ) will not be noticed again . even if the merge is ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered as completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 Set ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this can be adjusted specifically to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a previous point is marked . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated by default .
links to Fol@@ der : if the option is disabled , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions ) .
complete analysis of each file by displaying statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( specify a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders with a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security .
similar to the chan@@ ges@@ et date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful e.g. when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is disabled in pres@@ etting .
synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical . the results of mer@@ ging files will also be saved in both folders .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and ob@@ tains the extension .@@ orig@@ . When an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge of entire folders .
normally , the merge @-@ merge view stays visible in the merge of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want that , you can switch the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also directly merge a single file without having to run the folder merge .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency using K@@ IO Sla@@ ves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes using the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder . then a file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date from the original devi@@ ate . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as a difference Viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first starts the built @-@ in differences be@@ Viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Def@@ 3@@ Part from the contex@@ tual menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the Pre@@ view menu . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
if &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; run as part , it only supports compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hei@@ st Komp@@ are ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for quite a long time and learned a lot by st@@ alling in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or will go that way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but K@@ DE does not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines are next to each other , this is more often the case .
the editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
the effort was too big so far . you can always restore a particular version by choosing a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text , it suddenly appears ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you !
to be able to use all functions of &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ v@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties are encountered , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of this .
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt removal ) copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt inser@@ tion ) inserts the text from cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marking .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the update function . )
this also means that identical files are not copied to the target folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual working spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , exit them or move them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ tops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to other applications .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a working surface as well as on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager to set up ... and exit . if however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Be@@ ende . the commands cause the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows inside the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas .
if this field is enabled , the name of the virtual working areas will be displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual working surfaces . if it is shown together with name , the names will be marked with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop .
if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is enabled , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic lets &amp; p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N screen , as from p@@ ager applications appear in some other Windows managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual working areas in a horizontal and vertical line display in a vertical line , which is very good for displaying side@@ ways on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be modified in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch settings ... makes dialogue settings appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog . however , you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign a value to it . possible values are :
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is k@@ de@@ base , you will need a functioning install of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; K@@ mag to enlarge a part of the screen as if you read a lou@@ pe for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is supposed to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , it increases &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter like a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting of the mouse poin@@ ter . please note , that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not yet able to recognize the shape of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ M@@ ouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fier window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , press the button or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and more .
start or stop the ad update . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
choose the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your created short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and size &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to increase the screen size , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter survi@@ ves for a while at the same location . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click brings pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises when you click the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also feel pain caused by the use of your computer . if you suffer from pain related to your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this is not done yet .
to make it clear again : also if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse , and as with all the ergonomic relief funds : the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click as soon as you briefly inter@@ rupt the movement .
now , move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the mouse button to the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag it with pressed mouse button . the intelligent moving requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this refusal time must be blocked after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click will execute .
if Intel@@ ligent Move is enabled , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is set ; after the mouse @-@ down the mouse button is waiting , before releasing the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking on the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . this moves will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ ll@@ .@@ txt , but it can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there &apos;s a slide bar sound buffer , which you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; this feature is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window surrounds to find out how to run a program automatically .
rever@@ t all settings to the values that were set when you open the dialog . if you already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings are reset to the user &apos;s state after the last push of the dialog .
it is best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent moving should be switched off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response time of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not show a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , when a shifting process has just begun . if you use the intelligent shifting in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this will restore the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it will return and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor in another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor back where you want to have it . but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to have a keyboard . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title @-@ lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent moving is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to mark text to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and then insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse at pressed mouse button .
do not use the intelligent shift when you are just starting to use k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text instead : run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . as a result , the mouse button push@@ es a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the delay time starts when moving . later , you can use the intelligent shift even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to be able to use , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . this should be the case on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker , and these are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button briefly as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor har@@ dens . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain to the cra@@ cking of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a certain time is waiting for a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging can also be performed with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows mu@@ te users to let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of conversation sentences that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) enter the command , which will later be used for voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ book . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages used without typ@@ ing them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you define the dictionary for word addition . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can compare the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word supplement .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the bottom white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a sequ@@ encer of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you mouth mouth , you can enter the phrases you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can choose from it sentences that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , side word supplement as well as the side K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the input field of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kar@@ tei@@ karte &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop down box below the input field , specify the character en@@ coding to be passed on to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as default input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . you can find this command in the documentation on your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
the Dic@@ t@@ d @-@ Language Service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ amm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output and that is currently being developed in SV@@ N . selecting this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text passages book or in the bar for text passages .
when selecting So@@ fort , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally integrated into the input memory . the selected text passage will be entered only in the input field with the selection of In the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text pass@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text passages , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book log@@ book will not be saved . select Before En@@ cryp@@ tion , will be &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book should be stored .
the Wor@@ ter@@ Cover page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word supplement . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box where this list contains more than one dictionary .
use the buttons to the right of the page to delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can select the language for the dictionary on the input field in the input field .
for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is easily determined by counting the assignment . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
this option lets you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly typ@@ ed words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is split . in the upper part , the text passages are shown as tree structure .
in the lower section , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the matching ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . if you have selected a text entry book , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default over the editing window under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated , if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sli@@ dable bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
you probably don &apos;t have the command for voice output right or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command on the language output . ( see Settings dialog for Language Syn@@ thesis for more details . )
festival is a voice @-@ over@@ ing system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ panic are supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command to voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ eware folder . the speech output is then possible with one of the following commands :
for the third example , the option to send data as standard input must be enabled . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ e@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax is often swal@@ lowed by the last sign of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
/ usr / local / host@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local / / usr / local
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default must be enabled .
the voice output D@@ amm@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use Dic@@ t@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to set the settings , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
mouth &amp; mouth ; Succ@@ ess@@ fully use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with people who cannot speak , can let Text spend on the computer . it is stored a list of already broken phrases that the user can always spend anew .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth is not a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .
use help : / k@@ mouth ( type this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ desk help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a service consisting of modules that allows any application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; plac@@ ards ; even if and posters ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
the speech output is done by the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ help program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Met@@ a Language ( SM@@ ML ) .

an application with &amp; GUI ; for configur@@ ing and setting kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading texts from a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; kate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
in addition to the Bug@@ ch@@ illa database from &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts . you can subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ menus .
before you can use it , you need to install program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set it right . see also
for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no or@@ ators are set up , the car@@ p card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker , the mapping map will appear in general . see .
most T@@ TS Synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . they can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer .
different actors for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the cle@@ f map leader in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the map menu is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker .
all already established speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not provide a speaker .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the actors in the list determines also their priority .
on one of these buttons , click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ops system .
select a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker appears on the board card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use . go back to the General tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ D ) , so the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the Spe@@ ech system from &amp; k@@ de ; click General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options .
check this check box to activate the K@@ DE T@@ TS service . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the mapping card is displayed , and you can create and read text orders .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the Control Panel &apos;s system area , it disappears once the reading is complete .
with buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , pause and resume text orders .
the buttons in this series allow you to read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the Spe@@ aker for an order .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken over on all pages .
the ticket orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that should be read before , and select the text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML , pre@@ he@@ aders and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; Colum@@ ns ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that should be read before , and select the text in the main menu . then the speech output should start .
this also works when and posters ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ NO@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system that noti@@ fies you of events specified by you . you can also read &amp; kt@@ ts the text of these messages .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages . for example , set up to notify you when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ NO@@ ME , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ NO@@ fy vary depending on the application .
filter for string replacement offers a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ t ; incorrect or incor@@ rectly pronounced messages . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed . read also .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
filters are processed before being sent to the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working of filters , it is important to know how the speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will resume .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
news has the highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a web page , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news . read more .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you initiate from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of extended texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this issue is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
character Chain Re@@ plac@@ ers replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be provided with pre@@ defined string replacement filters that allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ formers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ml .
with language selection filters , you can send jobs depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . for example , if you have set a female voice on the voice card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue to change the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the page below . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed in rows from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the next setup di@@ alogs are displayed below .
for set @-@ up filters you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be replaced with the associated replacement text .
type a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Cre@@ ating . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete it . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will be provided with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; the numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter cop@@ ete .
the string replace filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box App@@ ly App@@ ly filter if all the input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the \ \ s word \ \ s word . so , the words must be limited on both sides by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; terms &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such de@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the utility x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PA@@ TH environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the speaker selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the speaker card , or to a speaker with specific characteristics . you can , for example , specify that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; passes a text to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program gives the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; and the speaker selected on the Spe@@ akers menu . with the Spe@@ aker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will select which matches the desired requirements . click the button on the right to view the dialog box selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or to delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker selection filter is only applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box App@@ ly App@@ ly filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD with the speech synthes@@ izer , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; you can find the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bilit@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML , -@@ XML ; -@@ Um@@ form filters , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone to enable S@@ able to work at all . you must also do this if you do not use this voice for reading web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the PA@@ TH environment variable .
certain notes or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only gib@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the drawing code is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string replace filter . see .

the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license which you can find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with kt@@ ts@@ d . you can also download the source code from ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
K@@ T@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; Con@@ sole .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer at the supported languages . also check the website of kt@@ t ; , for information that is not yet included in this manual .
speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &apos;s program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend &amp; kt@@ ts for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher program .
if you have downloaded the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for c@@ un@@ ete or downloaded the tar@@ ball that has been created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ t , first check if speech synthes@@ izer works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; which uses the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr program should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the SPD @-@ conf script is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can go back , repeat the sentence or paragraph , pause , pause , or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it will automatically be the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker selected , you will see in .
if you click Add on the Map Edit , and to make a speaker in the list or click Edit , the Map Edit Setup will be shown below . as an example , the module &apos;s setup for Festival Interactive will be shown below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PA@@ TH , you only have to enter the festival .
select the character en@@ coding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices known &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting is automatically made . generally speaking , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these sliding controls allow you to set the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controls and show this grey , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t allow you to adjust these settings .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first movement is synthes@@ ized quicker .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forgot to click App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected , the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr symbol in the system section is visible , but not the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is still not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD read a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here are all orders listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the job , the number of sentences and the newly edited sentence . the or@@ ator ID corresponds to the ID on the card holder .
with the buttons in this row , you can either proceed or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other maps ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages will not be displayed . read more about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .

the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all the PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select Def@@ ault .
on this map you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of voice orders :
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after reading the screen reader , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
news have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks out news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , welcome someone who just enters the room .
a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the incoming message .
the settings on this card only apply to normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ t ; read K@@ NO@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card card noti@@ fications appears .
select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications , where a sound is played , are rejected by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read before .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events for which nothing else is stated in the list are ignored .
use this selection field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event hits . you have the following choices :

you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard el@@ ects the speaker , which is shown in the list on the list on the list of cards as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as a final option , the action will come to fru@@ ition , which has been set under Standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can set the noti@@ fications as below :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the button store to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains marks for controlling votes , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ml is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you will need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default voice used in the SS@@ ml output .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 ; % , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set boundary detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds divide text into individual sentences . this can start &amp; kt@@ ops ; faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you can see the set limit@@ er filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , a set boundary detection filter is automatically set up as an input . you can change its settings or add more set limit@@ er filters , but beginners are advised .
the easiest way to learn how to select speakers is to try out . switch off the choice of speakers and select text to read . check on the speaker selection , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . you will have to do so , of course , more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function , you can pause or cancel orders on the card card .
for these reasons , the normal set limit@@ er filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change this filter unless you know what you are doing .
the set boundary detection filter compare text with a regular expression for set ends and insert a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) at the set boundaries ( tab@@ s are automatically removed from the text before filters ) . note that the standard set limit@@ er filter retains the character set .
S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( c@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ aders .
if you have removed the normal set limit@@ er filter , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
on the card selection tab , you can over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . the card display is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the car@@ p card speaker ) . in other words : no subscri@@ ber properties are specified .
use the most suitable speaker with all the characteristics of a speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker is most likely to match the originally set characteristics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything .
select this check box if the property has priority over other properties . you can also set several markings .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language is available if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the speaker area , which is closest to the following , click on the default push @-@ button and then use the speaker which is closest to the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr falls off immediately when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any trace@@ ability .

I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it at festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / dic@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / vocals . as a guide , you can use the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be so@@ x installed and discover@@ able by the environment variable PA@@ TH . some synthes@@ izer modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the card for subscri@@ ber units . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML . ( this is because HTML is converted into SS@@ ml ; ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ml de@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the speech speed .

festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ t .
you need to install at least one language . you can find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice is preced@@ ed by Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must vote for the votes MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ monitor . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) code , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option codes must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .

festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Synthes@@ izer . then festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output from it . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete speech output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates these of &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create from German lyrics di@@ phone .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which enables management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in the &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf to display the device at all and allow setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option is selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and release . by selecting the setting non @-@ once , the setting can be made permanently . next start of the network settings , this selection will be set automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are gra@@ yed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system management mode , you can enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system management mode , all functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the Reiter network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the Reiter network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings displayed on the network interface can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface ... set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
the automatic mode removes the TCP / IP settings from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further setup is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system .
with the option Man@@ ually without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field Network mask , the sub@@ net mask is set to specify .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . by ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the address you want is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be enabled or switched on as required . turn off an out@@ dated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched on as required . turn off a enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
specify the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a machine with DNS support replaces a full domain name through the IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requires ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will solve this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution hosts a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be sorted by selecting an entry and down or down@@ grade in the list with the buttons down or down in the priority .
clicking the button Add ... from the group Computer to the name resolution can be added to a DNS server . it will add the New Name Servers dialog .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the machine to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the dialog edit .
the list Nam@@ ed Calcul@@ ated Calcul@@ ator describes computer name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used during bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list of Nam@@ ed hosts contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP still in the test will replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the well known computer has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a name that is known by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog you want to edit is displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Adju@@ st@@ ment module are not immediately active in the system . to enable the changes , must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface can be used , such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is enough ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended by experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile and k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , and in the second , all of &amp; net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; configur@@ able configuration files are discussed .
this area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is conve@@ yed .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be implemented in the near future .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in external networks , at the &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point that has a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot simply be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) .
the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 net address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically modified at DSL connections so it will not be surprised if there is another content found there in case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is dropped by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that lets you run other programs according to a timet@@ able in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ system program cr@@ on .
when starting &amp; cr@@ on ; see a list of already set tasks and associated environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear for all users of the system as well as for system internal tasks . each folder can be opened and closed .
if the task is disabled , program names and parameters will not be displayed and the description will be de@@ activated .
the environment variables which appear here set out the otherwise existing environment variables for all tasks listed above . in a de@@ activated variable , it is de@@ activated as description .
to create a new task , first select the task folder . then , go to Edit New ... Alternative to it , right @-@ click on the Tas@@ ks folder and select New ... or C@@ tr@@ l ; N in the appearing context menu .
enter the name of the program to start . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press select ....
select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
when you specify both Mon@@ at@@ day ( e ) and week@@ day ( s ) , the task will be carried out both on a suitable date and on a suitable day of the week . for example , if you select the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be executed on the 1st and 15th of the month of the week , regardless of the date they fall .
as with creating new tasks , changes are made only when c@@ ron@@ tab has been saved .
to cut a task , first select the task to be removed . then , go to Edi@@ ting Cut .
alternatively , right @-@ click on the task and select Cut , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; X .
to copy a task , first select the task to be copied . then go to Edi@@ ting Copy .
alternatively , right @-@ click on the task and select Copy , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C .
to insert a task , first you have to cut or copy a file into the cli@@ p@@ board . only then is past@@ ing available at all . then select the Tas@@ ks folder . then , go to Edit In@@ sert .
alternatively , right @-@ click on the Tas@@ ks folder and select In@@ sert , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; V .
to make changes to a job , first select an option . then , go to the Edit Change menu ...
alternatively , right @-@ click on the task and modify ... select , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; O. It will then edit the dialog function in which you can edit the chosen task as described above .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a task , select the task to delete . then go to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to enable or disable a task , select them , and specify the state using the Edit En@@ able menu . in@@ active tasks are marked with in@@ active in their description .
alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the task and select En@@ able . make sure that the program name , parameters and description will be displayed correctly .
to execute a task instantly , select it and then go to Edit Now .
to create a new environment variable , first select the variable folder . then go to the Edit New menu item .
alternatively , right @-@ click on the variables folder and select New ... select , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; N .
enter the name of the variable . you can also select one from the list of the most commonly used environment variables , click on the arrow next to the variable name field . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the program to be sent to another as the normal address
as with creating new variables , changes are made only when c@@ ron@@ tab has been saved .
to cut a variable , first select the variable to be removed . then , go to Edit Cut .
to copy an environment variable , first select the variable to be copied . then go to Edi@@ ting Copy .
alternatively , right @-@ click on the variable and select Copy , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C .
to insert an environment variable , first it has to be cut or copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . only then , the paste option is available at all . then select the variable folder . then , go to Edit In@@ sert .
to change a variable , first select the variable to be working . then , go to Edit Change ... Alternative to select the variable with the right mouse button , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; O . then the dialog appears to edit variables , in which you can edit the variable as described above .
to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then , go to Edit Del@@ ete .
to enable or de@@ ac@@ ti@@ ver@@ en an environment variable , select it , and specify the state using the Edit En@@ able menu item . with a de@@ activated variable , it appears de@@ activated .
alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the variable and select En@@ able . make sure that the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly .
if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or altered , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the File Save menu .
alternatively you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables are only then active .
it appears the default k@@ de ; -@@ Print dialog . if you choose to fold out , you will see there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the printing dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have extended auth@@ oriz@@ ations .
cr@@ on , for example Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change user schedules .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; like gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses Standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar that also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing .
before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ train the tape and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . do not recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ ing force on the tape is not required , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ credits , search for the appropriate index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change in the symbol for the tape to see that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive assumes that a tape must be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the tape name and the capacity continues &amp; k@@ dat ; proceed with format@@ ting the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically mounted and ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a security profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
once the backup is initiated , the dialog opens up settings for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files once again and change the settings for the backup .
if you confirm the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
ri@@ ght@@ click one of the archives and select the menu entry Veri@@ fy ....
once the test procedure is started , the dialog box will appear for verification . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the check .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears check . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the Rest@@ ore , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
once the restore process has been started , the dialog box will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
if you confirm the restore settings , the dialog will appear Rest@@ ore . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can re @-@ create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder , where the backup is to take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder . folders that are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others .
exec@@ uting incre@@ mental backup . to see which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can do the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding option of the tape device .
this setting is active , tran@@ sm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command is loaded to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ector at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the release of &amp; k@@ dat is activated , automatically ej@@ ected by the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy spre@@ aders .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; change the hardware block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the name of the full name of the system is where the band was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the age in which the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar -@@ archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ system@@ blog ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system supports various protocol files .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ blog ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is backing up the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users to access information about problems that arise on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence tries to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and analyze the protocol files of specific programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ blog ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different kinds of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ blog ; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ blog tries to open the system log . it will not appear to you , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most probably not with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log , for the normal user normally no permission to read .
you can also use the filter strip to filter according to a selected criterion , or after entered strings . the list of the log lines is now automatically altered so that only log lines will be displayed , which will only show log lines to match the selected filter . in the default setting , a protocol line will be displayed only if in one of the columns contains the string of the filter search term .
you can , of course , select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched with entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the log file system log , select the process name , and in addition , in the filter bar , select the name of a process , so show &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to see the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color as protocol lines of level indication . the color display of protocol lines can be turned off alignment dialogue .
if you only want to display a specific process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column Process . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use Filter Panel .
in addition , you can jump to new lines in the main window &apos;s context menu to view all new log @-@ in lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ blog ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. you will find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ blog ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ blog ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named so ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system rapidly develops into the standard for controlling the program start @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD style .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could attempt to change a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel first looks like / etc after an in@@ it file .
the sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of direct in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to run when running the system or switching to another run level . system services do not include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it . you can also set a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you want to change something , then you come to repair it by re@@ starting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does in@@ it start and stop system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level that only lets ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run . furthermore , I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you will learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry in the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between level levels or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) only if it moves out an entry in the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new area . to only copy them to a new run level , you must explicitly choose from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action .
the sort number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to include the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different working areas ( available system services , running level 1 start , running level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cli@@ pping into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level by inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input key to change the properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard running level@@ n and now the machine is constantly running . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ use mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; designed to run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary configuration programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) can be termin@@ ated simply without notice if their configuration files are not present or configured incor@@ rectly .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either you use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the record store in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user name and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed when you have extended system settings . only when you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users will create a mapping card on which you can make individual settings . additional flash@@ cards appear in the case of shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the password management card appears in the case of shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if for at least a built @-@ in file system space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the File System field with space limitation .
the group of cards groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the field Pri@@ m@@ aries group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the U@@ sers or Group or click on the Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change operating systems add , remove , change and more .
