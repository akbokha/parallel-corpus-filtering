<seg id="1">Translate the module website in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Website. select from the list the starting and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated at the point of the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. babofish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions depending on the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated at the Babelfish page, where you can insert too translatable texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror; despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making this easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions, see the manual on & konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings to set up extensions.... open the Tools menu and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings from the kde; addons package. please note that you may have more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click the & konqueror; on Extras defilements. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if present, erase.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module View filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras address filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror; select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web site. as presetting the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentElement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various tool- and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportionally to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView, the size is the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily recognized, can easily be detected if they are far below the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color-matching and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either display depth for the light detection of the nesting depth or the image of another file attribute, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of representation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always complied with. frames are drawn to indicate the nesting of entries, and this framework takes place, which is then lost to the subordinate entries.</seg>
<seg id="20">Like splitting the surface of an entry for the subordinate entries, the implementation is left to the implementation. here, it is possible for the inscription and avoidance of space losses through frames always advantageous to divide the squares that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimally displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn to the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module picture gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the image gallery, a dialog opens, allowing you to define the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the" "" "Title" "" "tab allows you to adjust the title of the image gallery page in a text input field." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a turn field to set the number of miniatures each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">To view the filename of the image, specify whether the filenames are displayed in the gallery in the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="28">To view the file size of the image, specify whether the file size is shown in the gallery in the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the picture size check box, you can see if the size of the images is shown in the gallery in the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog box, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file selection Save in HTML-file, specify where to save the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder, you can set the subfolder with a slider to which level the sub-folders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the check box, copy original images to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the annotation file check box, you can specify a comment file for caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnail images than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & html; settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; -Settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & html; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You will find media playback for the navigation area in the & konqueror; menu under the navigation pane, or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation area of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to listen to media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu entry in the & konqueror; in addition, you can change the browser and operating system recognition for single domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change the browser detection into one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for sites that refuse to access browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser detection to use the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use the own & HTML elements, elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry setup... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in detail.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; module check your & CSS; Style templates and & HTML; -documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, every media and card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, review and correct your photos. the editing skills can be easily extended with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Though & digikam, it is easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG-export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; on camera or lens, which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. you should therefore report problems and improvement options.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; attempts to report problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or desires report.... This opens a dialog with a broken link. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error report system. all information you need is already entered. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project that is supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to join the user mailing list of & digikam. you can ask here questions to other users of & digikam. however, in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digiplug; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digicode; participation is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list of & digikam..</seg>
<seg id="64">When you first started, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder here. simply enter your path name or click the folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your machine. here, the data collection is stored. this path remains the same for all the image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; you will also use as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the topmost folder, the images, as the base folder. & digikam. see each subfolder as an album. no picture will change. during browsing the folder you will get a progress indicator as these:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; searches recursively the library path in all its depth. you can't close any subfolders unless it iste in hidden folder. this can be done by barbs & digikam. you can do this by inserting a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by using any photo from the album and put this on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can edit your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, it can also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help WinkameraBackup.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Roh decoder settings and raw processing steps.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, every media and card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk device. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives.</seg>
<seg id="75">Digital cameras that support an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions over the serial port are slow, this connection is in the meantime outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support so that the preview images of digikam can be reliably read. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you might not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digikam is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digiplug;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and gwenview. the goal is to provide modules to all graphics programs.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to complement one function than the changes in & digikam itself; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB, or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 and Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the tree tree, above the horizontal line of separation or in another application window. the only limitation is that an image cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common ones: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields displayed in the symbol view at the moment. thus, filtering on the filename only works when the symbol view is displayed. which fields are displayed, you can configure in the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos that are managed by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were recorded on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the Albenversion. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Import pictures to scan. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the pop-up menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and album features allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album features in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to select your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos, if you want to add or delete new collections from collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by Date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Elders, Average, New Year: they set the date on that of the oldest, the newest image or the average of the album. to do this, first attempts to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first opened an album in & digikam, the first image in the album will be selected as a symbol of the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos on the album. sometimes the first photo is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As album preview button. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all images in this album will be shown in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait a little while the preview images are generated. this can help you avoid using the Extras All preview images in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be displayed below the related thumbnail. what information this is, you can edit settings. select the albums page and adjust the area preview images to your liking.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse-pointer rest for a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all the key features of a photo. the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all it's about & digikam. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or the editing of the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 Image Edit... or the context menu of the image with the right button of the mouse and Edit.... in the editing pane, you will find a guide how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">You can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. the applications listed there are checked by the & kde; file permissions for the file type. to this, and how to customize it to your needs, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing, other image editing programs can cause problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image. this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest is to click the thumbnail to preview and rotate. in the submenu, you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam, it is moved to the trash bin of & kde; postponed. F8 Image deletion or Def If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Unf.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Datumslistequot; organizes your photos according to the data. & digikam which uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select one month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned individual photos or entire groups. as soon as a word has been assigned to a photo, the photo may be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Key words can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your key words logically. you can also collapse parts of the tree & quot; My keywordlist; so that you can find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keyword or click on an existing keyword and then select a new keyword. once you have clicked on an existing keyword, it becomes the substitch of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and dropping there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to postpone the keyword. a keyword can only be once in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">"" "you can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and select" "" "Edit Keyword" "" "in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword quot;." ""</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">It can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword quot;. alternatively, you can also click on the preview of the images and select keyword from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can indicate a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed once you select one of the key words assigned to it. in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keyword, this will appear under the thumbnail of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the pop-up menu. the menu only displays the key words assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a timately adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved using this histogram. to select a time frame, you only need to click on the lower rectangle of the selection box, which indicates the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. this will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">When you click here, the filter will be cleared and all pictures are displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you entered as search criteria. after saving it, it appears filters in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search will be performed. the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after the search, select only the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit search, the form for entering search appears again with the search information previously entered. if you choose to edit as extended search, the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search. more information can be found in the section The Tools for Advanced Search.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "if you want to delete an existing search from the list, select" "" "Delete Search" "" "in the context menu." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digikam's database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. all rules will be added to this list with search group / search group deleted or deleted from it. each option can be combined with others via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... You can also create search of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes every picture by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar. by using a swellert, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you move a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; finds the appropriate pictures. also here can be set a threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or move it out and move it. move it while you press the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a Live Geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a luminous in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L The light table added from the context menu. the selection is added to the illuminated table and its window opens.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar, you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and place it there. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select preview from the toolbar and perform Zoo / Sliding operations on one of the images, then they are also executed with the other image. you can therefore compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you use combination mode to navigate from the toolbar, then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparisons. now, use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to see it in the right pane. this simplifies it through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions work directly from the light table such as F4 file Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All picture information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the lower end of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to wave the visible area of the image, you must click on it and hold the & LMB. in the preview mode, both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just as in other views. just use the zoom-control below the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom in. this happens in both pictures if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken until the final issue and the permanent storage. each of the photographs collects, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We'll give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect, and use photos again. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers editing & editing. we view the download, rename, delete, convert, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital Inventory takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, seeks, transforms, assemble and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you will need to find a certain photo without stock management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you will certainly not use & digikam. the approach can store metadata in both a database as well as in the image files ensures very fast searches and secure archiving to which you can access other programs, platforms and formats freely.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you log anything into your system is the structure of information structure as opposed to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. make sure you have to switch to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday images can be quickly found over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant access of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files match? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation between original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to save metadata in the editing page of the metadata in & digikam. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the relevant item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what if you want to change them? added & digikam; they have a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now assign keywords, labels and an evaluation to any photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. it makes sense because you can focus on the best photos during further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now use keywords, keywords, as you often call other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam will; automatically build the tree for you or paste the images to the right place. resorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a subtree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">This is a very rough representation since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to annotations or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want anyone to let your photos be seen simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming, have associations, memories, the historical time span is present again, you may even hear the silence. therefore, the caption has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others looking at your photos, the title is possibly more important than the image itself to generate interest. if you show pictures, you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help Him understand what you are going to understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is alright if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time. KDE even provides you a spell checker. if you export your pictures in web galleries, then these labels will tell you the story for publishing no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation is already moving at the speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are countless and will become even more poignant in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travel using images with geographic information.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and designates the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the direction page of & digikam which should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the photographer's name, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, the name of a company or organization can no longer be changed. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: linked to the author. this field contains the job title of the photographer. examples of this may be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you provide the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with machines can delete or modify this information embedded in the image. for private individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate error, plate failure, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, disseminated superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper pictures or negatives.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, they need to be treated cautiously and you may not dare to spend more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good discos and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so it's about choosing the right ones.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors even if you are just written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection, they age through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; but it is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discurants keep your statistics for themselves. your manufacturer's creants include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the mechanisms of error of hard drives on this topic: floppy study</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART can not detect these errors. some errors identified by SMART show the imminent failure. these are especially read errors and encapsals. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can usually be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make a lot of electric shocks, it looks different for devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause severe keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. but remember that not every plug-in bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should be aware that all peripheral devices that are connected to your system should also be protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection that also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it can be useful to invest in a non-interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power outage occurs. some models will allow you to save your data and keep the system shut down. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">A high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can get you for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your machine is protected with it. at the end, you should always remember all the cables before going on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. furthermore, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies in the offer contain a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs, at least, ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst part is that no one tells you when a transfer error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these interruptions remain undetected until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data route than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. you will see thousands of mistakes in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="206">It is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in alpha state. it uses the same protective mechanisms that ZFS is using and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss on notebook and 46% for workstation systems. notebooks already account for the percentage of thieves 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to less damage than for example theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know very few viruses and under & Linux; has not been seen for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most popular filesystems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical borders. it is meant that while the technology is evolving, there is a natural limit to this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Even DSLR cameras have your frontier at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have your frontier at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolution, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't make anyone responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so, backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive every day. if, then, one day, a flash will hit you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane crashes: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">For this reason, desaster prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your backups to the neighbouring house, your office or the like.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for data loss in spite of securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two times: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup was made. this backup comes with a versioning system closest to the exception that it is only scanned and not running.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images right after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach lets you discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for the backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original memory, scalability, media, retrieving images and metadata, copying the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that precious images survive the next 40 year, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way to make a certain vigilance. the fewer variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available to everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area that you want to increase to a dedicated plate or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new disk has been recognized by the system but don't impose it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& Dollar; dd if = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBt; # operates with ext3, FAT16, 32 and rows & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of Excel if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software can be read, you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you shouldn't use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard developed by GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG is able to store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment for heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a license-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is indebted to use metadata.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block & quot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive your recordings, mostly in the raw format. XMP fits this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw format will decay. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and place it all together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI assemblies, annual conferences and workshops, standard compounds and enlightening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, card reader or scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edit, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For an intricate processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digikam, then you should add the metadata again. these were probably truncated by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the copyright with a digital watermark. export them to web galleries, encode them in MPEG, use them in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam. in the addition of a photo to an album, you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicode; use, connect these to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it will attempt to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a hey indicator appears at the bottom and thumbnail images of all photos on the camera will be displayed. some cameras do not show thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the features and metadata of the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata tab displays internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notes, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click to download and then download the selection of All. this invites all photos from their camera to a single record in & digikam. downloading the photos will not be deleted and we suggest you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired with the standard selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download the selected.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New Download is available. these images have been downloaded until now. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download or download the selected buttons, a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is displayed in the My Albums section. then select the album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you've selected the target album, press OK, and & digikam; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the Delete All button. if you want to delete only some, you have to select it first and delete the selected deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera. the photos will not be deleted in the garbage bin of & kde; they are completely deleted. so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded from the camera. if you want to delete the camera body completely, you should do this via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are usually re-used after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames in case you load photos of different recording series into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken in the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder per day is automatically created.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens up three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two will affect the data about the author in the default autoridentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S in the edit field.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the option camera file name, you have the option to change the filenames into lowercase when downloading. or in uppercase letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digikam; used for a photo is displayed below the name the camera provides in preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information about the camera's orientation at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally enabled, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, it lets & digiplug; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the extension button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date in which the photo was taken, can & digikam. these subalbums are based on the image data. all images with the same date are uploaded into the same sub-album. not all the cameras provide this information. in the Meta section of the Meta data section, you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in this case, it stores & digikam the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option on. use the Advanced tab and select the Date-based bottom line at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & edit; you, where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear. select the folder and click OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO, or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can click on a browser to display the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digiplug, users who want to locate the location of the photo, or simply want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first you should know that there are many GPS data fields, such as direction, seatrites and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical attribution (manual) and the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in the gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the geo-geographical mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data from pictures and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of hailed coordinates, which are created by maps.google for example.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; tries to give you as much control over its work processes as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you have to select settings in the Settings menu; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can change between these by clicking on the icons of the left.</seg>

<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the appropriate IPTC data fields when selecting the option to download from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is synonymous with the subject line: this field should include the professional name of the photographer. this can be designations such as hired photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the Autorouter, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture to others & quot; anbietenquot;. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data into the corresponding IPTC-fields. by doing so, it is achieved that metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digikam. this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digikam without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image captions as embedded inscriptions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos with the labels embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor in the main window rests over a file. depending on the option selected, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam is tried, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in a & digikam; album folder that has none of these extensions, of & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the brightness of & digikam can be set to the default values. each time you then open the light table these settings are switched on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size ladenquot; you should only use on fast computers. if you have one then you can get better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with a darker or bright color in the image. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma subsampling means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia about the more detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">Setting PNG compression allows you to reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG is using a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">The TIFF compression option can be used to compress the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality since the Deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG-2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digikam, image editing was just an image viewer for photos. currently, it is evolving very quickly to a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are the same. if you use this option, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option distinguishes the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic ink balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the shears. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top lights, so the parts of your images that are burned due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights, as piercing white. use the setting colors to create some unusual results because it shows the pointed shine in various rose holes. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of missing information from the shrouters.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixel is generally not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore attempt to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the reconstruct option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can be done later in the editing options of the & digikam. to keep the time for the demo-icing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosainvoicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color softening correction, since it is performed during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to get it back. there is also LCMS and & digikam. information like the color information from a color space in the other are to translate the colors as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Find here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profile you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain color-mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma doesn't correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the color mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the soft-proof profile that lets you emulate how your image would be given back from a device. this is very useful before you can print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some color so you can manually correct this instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is pretty obvious which colour profile is provided with them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is, of course, unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface, & digikam can support many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will then be loaded by & digikam. these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">"" "short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings" "" "Shortcuts" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) via KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project via http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn the metadata into or out, which appears at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties show a list of all cameras currently supported on the left. on the right side there is a button Automatic Detection that tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicode; you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog box for moving &gt; images in the trash bin, you can edit & edit the video's conversation; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find more details in the delete of a photo and deleting an album.</seg>

<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digicode; to adjust the main window to your taste. you can select these settings under Settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about it in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on previewing a picture or by the contextual menu of previewing and selecting the ad / editing item.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam. so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, displaying file name, current file number, magnifying factor and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions of image editing change your photos. however, none of the features will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by reproducing or using the Restore File button Restore the Image Processing button. you then lose any change you've done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any image processing action can be undone or restored. the last action can be undone by selecting Edit Restore or Restore by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make use of the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; pressing the button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes in the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the check menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enlarge factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view where you use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can change it in the creation dialog of & digikam. you can view it from the & digikam window; see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the File menu and get the Standard & kde; Print dialog. you can customize the settings before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole phrases. whole picture preview pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select print wizard from the Album Export. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrows, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab lets the sidebar appear and disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF and IPTC- fields, so you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">Once you have commented, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the inscriptions will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the Apply button, there is a button. with this you can also read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field of Urgency. the coding follows the diagram in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords, the keyword tree, and a selection box with the keyword used previously.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can easily limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all key words of an image are stored in the keyword IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to provide a sample with a keyword, please read the section Keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The header Keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left sidebar is used with their Album, - Dat-, Sword and Search-views. if you add one or more keyword filters out of the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all created key words are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop off. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keyword. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears, which asks you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is written in no key words, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialogue asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be turned off under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be a or must, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and the rule area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an advanced search across all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why didn't Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I adapted it mainly to & digikam; s specific implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors from your camera or scanner come in a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or post to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflow. the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow fulfils all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image editions are per e-mail or the web where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use a different colour space and thus have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, check out Bruce Lindblooms's excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in sRGB colour space or not, you need to calibrate your monitor because sRGB states that you; onitor to sRGB so you need to calibrate your monitor to the sRGB colour, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, balance, automatic synchronization and contrast extend from the menu Correcting Automatic Correction attempt automatically to make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminosity values over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot becomes as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same: this method adjusts the luminous reactor of the colour of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the same produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation, which causes either miracles in one image or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it identifies the dark and bright boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the entire histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest range and a new jiusport of all values in between. this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance adjustment is a little constrained since a color space with 8-bit per color is worked. if you can be too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the finish image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target pictures has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right, a histogram is displayed that will change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your results depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shade adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the controls mentioned above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result displayed in white balance. this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and load exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and reload later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The preset button reverts all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the depth per color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialog as used for processing raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be performed by subwindows for the brightness elements. a detailed manual for using color profiles can be used to consult the color management chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under color tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, so you can use it for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct coating problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool color effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also known as Sabatia, was an effect that was created when a partial developed pressure was emitted by a short flash light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar synchronization. at approx. 50% intensity the image shows what is chemically feasible. finally, a negative image creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). applied intensity lies at 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia's name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and therefore it is not unusual to change the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustment can be viewed in preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. in this case too, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform can be viewed in preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple light intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on tone correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slide for the application explained here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked into into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controller and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand side, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for medium tones, often called gammasts.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color tweets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. the compression of the output values can, for example, be used to create a hidden picture as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: using these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input value is automatically readjusted for all shadows, means and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to locate overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of adjusting entry values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target picture will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera, linear mode is mostly the most sensible. in this case, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with dark utterances and that the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photo you can see a red marking. if you move this marker on the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. check the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator monitors all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if pixels are found in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun tones have been set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digikam. image editing is a tool to improve color channels or to change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">The channel selection box lets you select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison to one's own tab.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the finish image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will retain the general brightness even if you also activate the appropriate color components, since the channel mixer is THE tool for producing great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. color space consists of small noise-artefacts that do not appear in the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting can save you for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to locate overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is activated. the original image is shown in (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. in the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, because color images can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film rolling profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford Panier Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulated a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, in all scenarios and fits particularly well with portraits towards the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filtered: simulated a black / white film exposure with an orange lentil filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filtered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of the day. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulated a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscape and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm, light and middle tones while adding a little coldness in the shaded tones. this is very similar to the process of leaching a pressure and the re-development in a smal pad. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 cokin (tm) smal filter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug; applying tool texture you can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the engraving of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right raises the impression of depth and / or three-dimensionality of texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper texture effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) can be seen. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; add tool frame a decorative frame can be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photograph is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you enter the desired frame type for your image. throughout the picture with a colored line, Niepce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white images), decanted it with a nice three dimensional frame.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The finish image which is decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of the images, especially if you have used the tool After side ratio previously used.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any position. this also goes in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text orientation, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click "OK" on the button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; apply tool template you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image template menu can be used in image processing can be used to place templates via an image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation. however, you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the template, just send an email in English to the template.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder is set for the templates, a tree view appears to reflect the folder structure of the stencil folder. the selection of a folder updates the preview toolbar of the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below is a preview of three buttons that can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob enlarges the underlying image. it is centred around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button drops the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK, if you want to apply the template to your image. the image is then automatically adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates grainy images especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it does not work a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process must be combined with minimal differences to a color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more later sharpening than normal cameras for the home users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpness. pictures in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpness filter while reading the image. if you deactivate it, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with sharpening of focus. you can use the menu entry for correction.</seg>
<seg id="487">The sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also strengthens the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image can refocus the tool. you can refocus it using the menu entry, for more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool for softening with the menu entry, Conducting softeners and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter nonsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values frequently generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount will boost the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of burrs might cause sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of a channel. high-resolution images permit larger radii. therefore, they should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped picture added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount. thus, you can define a minimum difference for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempt and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masculine filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). blurred masculine was applied with Radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected detox-filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocusing usually achieves better results as blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding functions much better than the palatal folding. the palatal folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR indiverse of the palatal folds is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels, causing undesired results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should result in good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, and eg; 0 the image quality is very poor. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will further aggravate the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius of the gauss's sharpness. use this parameter when your blur is gauss. in most cases you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauss's edge. note however that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to do all the trimming, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before altering the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but leave later unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read images and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, non-sharp mask produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blur masking a larger neighborhood used than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blur. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the ideal ruler filter. practically the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Glätte places the blur of the area of the darkened area in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color ink allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to fine tune the filter settings, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to smooth smoothing over the image. whereas larger values predominate mainly homogeneous regions and details must be sharp. please note that the detail maintenance should always be subject to directional dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes in all directions while a value draws near to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD noise will generate a high value waveleric pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothness factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothness. therefore set this value to match the level of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is run. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle distance da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. so you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothness and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality you get by selecting this option is minimal. it doubles the duration. therefore, we recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors with small artefacts can be corrected. the module is used on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artifact in the background that caused by a bad film shift during the journey. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digicode; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts from dust or hairs on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">Below you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings window will remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller bugs fixed.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of sharpness. this value sets the pixel pitch front of the filter to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer get image details and noise or forging occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can't be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG-artefact without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the density tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gameplay tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically more noisy. however, it also merges the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phase damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected value (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool for softening with the menu entry Conducting softenness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam site; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film graining, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or retrospectively digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frankonkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compressions & quot; artiactsquot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of photo-restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on a Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film baskets on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures have been reduced to an old color photo that has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that have been created by scanner and photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool hotpixel allows to remove Hotpixels from photos with a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw materials, as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built-in suppression for hot pixel.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtractional method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels due to CCD dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate darkroom to the corrected image. automatic processing of the darkest will find the bad pixel. note that the assistant will notice the last dark image and will automatically recharge it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filters method to interpolate these pixelblers. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Cut: an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined. the resulting colour is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel sheet are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel-block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubical surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is visible below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digiplug; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially the medium and large photo formats, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range equally. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to hold the camera by hand. wide-angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise impair effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the wide exposure ranges of today's film and color or greyscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation to an image without this filter.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target picture.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which equates an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a luminous intensity of 2, reduce it to compensate for a small degree of vignetting.</seg>
<seg id="572">Light intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the Vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the image using these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine readjustment of the exposure of the target picture, let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam. image editing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flaws off the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth degree corrects the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geometric distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion 2nd degree. with negative values, barrel distortion can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameters' has the reversed accidentals of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image shrinks.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog will illustrate the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The cushion-shaped correction should be performed before any changes or size changes. best perform this correction as the first one. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would be obvious.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides a vertical and horizontal line of help. move the mouse pointer in the image preview around the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu Transformating cut out of the image processing or via the Zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the barrel-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs such as pictures of front, frame and paintings is the perspective so correct that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infrared film of the Gimppickup web site which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 iinfra-film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters of film graining and film sensitivity (ISO). check the option Added Film granularity if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control changes the amount of film granularity and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows will know how snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels for reproducing infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos because the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the shitters.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; Filter Filmlining is an easy-to-use tool for reproducing film graining on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver baskets of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grabbing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film faculty effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the applied film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; Filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">The upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better for large images. smooth the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processor is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size image is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon sketch. images of their gradient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you have chosen yourself to sketch out. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon draw filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; Filter engraving informs yourimage in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; Filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows you to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wavelenges 1: divides the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wavelenges 2: analogous to the wave-blocks 1 the image is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Beende.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: blurs the image along Star-shaped lines that go from one centre point. this simulates the blur of a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurred the image by turning the pixels at the center point. this simulates the blur of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Sharpness: blurs the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to be back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blur: blurs the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: shooting from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blur blur: blurs the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurs the image by random shift of the pixels and thereby simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color pool in the image and blurs it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and then recreate it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time by pressing the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this makes it natural to your images a wet look. it uses an algorithm protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of the drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digicode; image editing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the range, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter regentropfen the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the rain drop filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the painted picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it to the right orientation by mirroring or turning. in the menu, you can find the tools in transforming turning and transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and sharp the details? how can you zoom in a picture if the limits of resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the Cimg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformation size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size modifies a linear interpolation method to approach the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to increase an image. & digikam; uses a more developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Preserve aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">"" "the" "" "Save As and Load" "" "buttons are used for this purpose. every single stallying for Photo can be saved as a text file and then recharged." ""</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take very long and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Beende.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by magnifying a small image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. in order to cut a photo you simply need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be grayed out. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by moving at the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the blank, use the button The trimming button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X).</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the lateral format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio cuts a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can see, for example, a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">In the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. relation button to cut the area to the widest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the aid help enable you to hide help so that you can put your images together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonious divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle aligned with similar harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden mean: the golden centre is a division that focuses on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a nautilus shell or the flower petals of a sunflower. it appears in all kinds of things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used already with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden mean. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides smoother relief lines when you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow on this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to guide the golden spiral. it should be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles derive from the golden spiral also discussed above. its vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break up your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles.</seg>
<seg id="659">Flip Horizontal Flip and Vertical Options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can become invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it is easy to keep the camera upright or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the & digikam; image editing and the tool-free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slide are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can reset the slider to 0 degree. a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window.</seg>
<seg id="664">Move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. once you have moved it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find undesirable triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix it is to use the function Transformating cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the Automatically cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the turn. but note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the image becomes a little bit lubricated. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double-strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasantly triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">A horizontal line, for example, will shift the top part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not rotation, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transforming scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">If you press presets, the angles will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed on the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the modeling tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you've done the shearing, the image becomes a bit blurred. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two shellings produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After lubrication, the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries compiles have been compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, they will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgrapher; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there has been no modern & GUI; programs that include & graphiviz; programs that include & graphiviz; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kimageviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgrapher; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kimaviewer; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & posters; and & konqueror; (so that a modification of the graph in & posters; the graph is recomputed and in & kimageviewer)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; to open or to open the graph in & kgraphik; in a & kate; -component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Load large graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and one hack to present more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphic viewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for the representation of graphs.</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. in the beginning, if you start & kimaviewer; without starting an argument, the main window will only open the symbol file and open the (empty) list of Recently opened files.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & old; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below, you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change. & kimaviewer; can also remember your decision so that later it will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item settings kimaviewer; set up... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a Graphite file outside an ongoing & kgraphic viewer, open the instance, & eg; in the file browser or command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & corgraphic viewer, or if you want to display the graph in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice and change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split on several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graphene divided on several pages without headline and other font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewable Shop page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore changes) or re-enquire the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphiviewer; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the current session) or determine that each time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of & kgraphiviewer. you can set a default behavior (open the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked at any start.</seg>

<seg id="749">Here you can choose from different & Graphiviz; -Layout algorithms. the entries as described on the webpage of & graphiviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">The algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unicited graphs. it produces representation in accordance with the jumping model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a bounce model layout for non-illuminated graphene. it uses the Fruchterman-Reingold-Heuristics, and includes a lattice trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphene.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm ranks the knot circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclical structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout subcommand, which is then executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as parameters, and specify the calculated layout of the graph by stdout in xdot format.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; directed, & neato; for unicited graphs).</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to do this you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry images, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your machine. select the source from which you want to fetch the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default values with the default value. see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the scanning button. the estimated file size will show you in the right, bottom corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window will be displayed completely as some settings might not appear.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the scanning button, you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the image file will appear. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore create very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots once you have selected in the Import - &gt; Screen photo menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>

<seg id="797">"" "the module" "" "Export to Flickr" "" "can be used to upload images from your computer to a flickr server on the Internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so it is your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so you can login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. you will be presented the following page after a successful application.</seg>
<seg id="800">Just close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the module exporting to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. at the moment, the module does not support any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add photos should be pressed once you have set any other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you click on the Ok button, the upload of the photos to Flickr server will start.</seg>
<seg id="803">The key field can be filled with a comma-separated list of words. these are added to the image as key words during the upload.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the image's metadata. geographic data is stored in the image's EXIF-keywords and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geo localization locates tools geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, latitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx-format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical location Korrelator. this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to create a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a log file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same time in the same locations as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is carried out which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera cell must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. put your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation indicates an upper variance for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from a location for pictures you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpoling and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next, you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region and enlarge sie.Leave this again and again until you have reached an adequate accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will encode UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab allows you to select all the albums that should be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right side will quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the preview and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Appearance Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport that contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with other color depth. of course, it also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The preview images will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has generated the pages, the window will not be automatically closed. you can therefore read the programs to see if errors occurred during production. the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotation, zooming or moving on them. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse lists. he has been developed for quick image display and quick access to his functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases as there is no compression of color information. this can be found, for example, in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the node-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the merge function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please check out excl 2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file to MP2 or WAV in the slide.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module, it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Slideshow. after that, you can start using Extras MPEG Diashau to start the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio, where you can also change the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">The video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to reproduce the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value produces very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the created file under the name of the mpeg file. keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, then it will be integrated into the film. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start the creation of the film with the button coding. depending on the speed of your computer you can now go fast or in all quiet a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that coders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages using the Settings button below.</seg>
<seg id="852">Print Wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is useful for printing you or printing directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats of JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from dcraw to produce the same results as the software is produced by your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file that should be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window then appears in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now readjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion results. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG is using a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to edit your images frequently or later use it otherwise you should not choose the JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is saved in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are secure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to convert all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image. in addition, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the pictures to send before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the images window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview is displayed on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag pictures to the picture list and place it in order to add it to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button to remove images, the selected images are removed from the list of images to send.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the images, click the OK button to open the new message window of your e-mail client. you only need to add the addresses and the subject here.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change settings for sending images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the pictures are added to a text file and the mail is enclosed.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG file format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in images file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original exifdetails will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages, in search of errors, but your e-mail program will run automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diashau, a window with questions like you want to have displayed your slide show appears. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL output option activates very elegant image transitions by using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphics card, as otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the left bottom corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">"" "the" "" "loop" "" "option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop. you can then manually cancel it using Esc." ""</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time gap between the pictures can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test this before showing your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between the images chooses a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI Module Time & Date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as a background for your KDE desktop environment.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments, you can start with & kPhotoAlbum; by this browsing, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, there are now in each group, so in people, places and in the group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have annotated your images and videos. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images on which both persons are to be seen. by using this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can view with preview images to view the images of your sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture every person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can use & kPhotoAlbum; however, for each person to save a thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display images beside the name, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have a suitable picture for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must, however, define which image for each individual should be displayed. to do so, you need to select the image check-in window (described in more detail) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you visit the search in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for creating picture properties. you can view this dialog once more on the image.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field labeling or description, the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can either be part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can search all images by certain names, as you can see in the picture. here you see images on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kPhotoAlbum; if you don't like to read manuals, but rather try to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kPhotoAlbum; and watch the fast entry, screenshots and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kPhotoAlbum; and select in the first dialog the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select Help menu entry photoalbum; demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kPhotoAlbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the home page of & kPhotoAlbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kPhotoAlbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar is shown here:. as the name says, this bar displays date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed items previewed from the database (if you select a date, the first image will show you this date in the preview window) and the timeline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images as you navigate in the preview screen.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select one area of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timestamps. if you select an area, in the preview-view only images of this time are displayed. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline beam.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kPhotoAlbum; provides two ways to create HTML websites with your images. one is available in & kPhotoAlbum; the one is available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kPhotoAlbum; built-in version is described, which you can create via the HTML Menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML-file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select if a & kphotoalbum; -export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information should be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information displayed to the viewer is obvious even without a description. for example, that all images are of a party. note that & kPhotoAlbum; currently all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can specify how the HTML pages should look. most settings are clear, which is why this is not specifically dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download any images that have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified. so, he can search your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transfer time. if he wants to get a picture larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">In the best way, select a base folder for all your HTML files, and for each successive set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if they are really all visible to viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser will start after the pages have been created. the URL that you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you have to copy them manually there. to enable the import function, see, correctly, you have to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you just described have taken all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a sub-folder will be created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kPhotoAlbum; coming together, you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kPhotoAlbum; this work will not make again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kPhotoAlbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you can have all images together and share this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kin file either directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file along with a HTML file, this will create an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the file of the .kin file. if the images are not found, the images of the URL you have created when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kin file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images that you can export via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is intended to be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the manually copy option to the .kim file, copy the images into the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option in proximity of the .kim file copy copy & kphotoalbum; the images will be automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. because most images are already compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the Import menu... select, & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The importing Wizard consists of four steps. first you have to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane) while this category is named in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog window which categories of the imported file should be imported, and which categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can balance the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: when you view images, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) setting up the information about your images, over (2) viewing and viewing, through to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your images, but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual you talk about images, but often this includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kPhotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal Backup Tools, to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kPhotoalbum; remembers the folder where your images are stored and automatically reuse it for future starts. if you want to read another folder in & kPhotoAlbum, you can start & kPhotoAlbum; with the -c option, you can start with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kPhotoAlbum; set up... you will get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kPhotoAlbum; in the following section of the user manual you will find the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons, with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described in detail how you can set different properties for each image, for example people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups, e.g. objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left half of the list you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kPhotoAlbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digikam and gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & kPhotoAlbum; however, they are sold separately. however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications together, it may be that the modules with & kPhotoAlbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules have in common with KIPI are very different, whereby it may be that some modules with & kPhotoAlbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kPhotoAlbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can create their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates for some modules order to albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is just the current view, so all the pictures that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kPhotoAlbum needs to be released; the modules also include a list of albums.</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kPhotoAlbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry in this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the preferences dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category persons, & kPhotoAlbum; so do so, so if you would have selected people to view and share this with the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kPhotoAlbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture, you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kPhotoAlbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to by any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. currently, there is not very much information as you do not yet have any information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kPhotoAlbum; is the possibility to annotate any picture with notes. this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture, where the image has been taken, etc. you can use each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is illustrated and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these comments when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">These are a very important part of & kPhotoAlbum; they are a very important part of & kPhotoAlbum; since you will always use it again whenever you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the pictures inside the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people, you can, by that the names used are moved up, the people find and assign them faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive an alphabetically sorted list, click on the list icon by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have any comments for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected images and annotate them with annotations. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons that are located under the thumbnail of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several images, e.g. with the same person, it may be more convenient to select all these pictures and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window showing the USA as a subgroup. to show you that it is a subgroup, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or sub-category. in addition, you can also drag an entry into a category and place it in order to make it an sub-category of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the Comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that is the upper edge of the frame. you can also make an own window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs, you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button..., which offers, among other things, the possibility to save the current construction and look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also make a frame completely hidden. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide windows. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in your browser, you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images, or all images if you do not have a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply pulling the mouse down with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image is set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the image viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and select either the Remove button or select Edit menu. now, the window appears you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kPhotoAlbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kPhotoAlbum; you can also use images anywhere, so & kPhotoAlbum; you can record the images anywhere, so & kPhotoAlbum; you can see the view of & kPhotoAlbum; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images where the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the images 5-9 the preview images are present, so & kPhotoAlbum; you can view the preview of these images. however, you cannot view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, you need to copy and copy files from the folders. & kPhotoalbum; do not support it until now. so if you want trouble as to avoid confusion of your images, please purchase a larger disk to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name Privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images so that at the end those who want to see your little sister open and click on the menu item Everything other than current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This way you have defined which images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you have the laptop now of your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, so you can hide all the images you have locked. if you want to see the images again, click Lock to lift.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select the password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand all images are on the hard drive and on the other everyone can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this kind of password protection is only used to forbid those who deal with & kPhotoAlbum; not very familiar to forbid the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & photo album; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at it at some point. for this reason, & kphotoalbum features; via a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see it. of course it shows the image, but additional information you have on the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox is on the top of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information should be displayed. all these options are available after right-clicking on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had chosen people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and down. you can navigate to the first and last picture with Pos1 and End. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as slide show. & kPhotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & kPhotoAlbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to fullscreen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom in. to zoom in, you can simply move a rectangle with the mouse. the minus key zooming in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the results of zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the key button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed out. with the key button sets the zoom, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work for videos do come in and zoom in with the plus and minus keys.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu, you can rotate the picture. this does not work for videos. you can make comments to the current picture using the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can look at it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name. you will perhaps prefer to select the image and look at more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer has the possibility to provide images with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in, you see a picture with which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have added features to your images, they are available in your browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just add all of them at once with comments. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be viewed in preview mode. if you want to view categories in dre preview screen, then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will be allowed & kPhotoalbum to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not stored with the image but in the database. in the way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In which you can see a picture painted on it. to switch on the painting mode of & kPhotoAlbum; switch on on the image from the contextual menu. to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovray; you need to master the application of the program & Povray; not fully rule, but the documentation to & Povray; should you have necessarily read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the location where you want to insert the object and click either the toolbar icon or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu appears, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">By deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right-click context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene before.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have modified properties, click Apply to Apply these changes. if you have typed invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply, or discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to the & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; -reference to the displayed object with the help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already includes the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as presetting the entire texture is rendered even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the camera's control points. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifting. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the visibility stage of the higher-level object or as an absolute value. objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as preset. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window arrangement or if you need another configuration, you can adjust it as you like. you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the mark to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the passer to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the passer in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the top of the tab in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is floating Views: views not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, drag the passer on the desktop or click on the small left pointing arrow in the front panel.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the fiber strip. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with view window arrangement... Save. it displays a dialog where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it renders. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual has been written, & Povray; 3.5 is current. this version is not supported in & kpovray; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on RenderList icon Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu item View scene renders.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select View Render Modi... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to see the character of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the section subsection and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">These images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray of pixels. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling exceeds the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptiv-recursive; recursively because each pixel is divided over and over again and adaptively because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam of pixels. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are followed individually and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generating noise for the beam process called jittering. if you turn on jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for rendering the rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental characteristic of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not made an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of the & Povray; -console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finishes, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import one & Povray; import the scene, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not the full command range of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing errors, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovray; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version here. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height data) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also add the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for viewing the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions separately.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you resize high level of detail for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you tick the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you view ground, a bottom is rendered beneath the objects. the bottom is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate channel smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more exact specifications on the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window frames or create new window arrangements. in the window instructions section, you will see how to create and save window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector dialog box: shows all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all the existing window arrangements. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button removed.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten anchoring the window under the existing window, with card card you will receive a map view together with the previous view and floating the view does not appear in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without a more accurate knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your entire scene lies in the dark and you only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything faultless, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols often, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this tutorial, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Editing Delete. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice this in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of rendering the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you click the Apply button or the input key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example, insert a header (insert finite body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; provides a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the input button. in the object tree, the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now also shows the level, though at the moment only as a limited finite plane. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree accurately, you will find that you can expand the item for the bottom when you click on the symbol + before the object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to the exercise one unit beneath the horizontal line, only so that you get to know some of these parameters. select a shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens, in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first sub-object. the pigment is then displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview you will see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview only shows a matte black material, because you still need to add settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see the color on the cube and the ball in the preview, click the Apply button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now properly set. if you now render your picture with one click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select one-color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to perform this step, since you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; you should have understood the ball as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can change the settings immediately. set the value for the radius: click 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the Apply button), so the ball has contact with the floor. otherwise, the ball would float above the floor as you shifted the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the next step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first sub-object and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click Arsphere Pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the screenshots below and click Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness-effect and reflection have already resulted in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered by you & kpovmodeler. hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog effects. thus, the scene is processed pixel for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene that should be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversed command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option pre-set short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove toolbar icons for & kpovmodeler; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A jump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each diffuser individually on the surface and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel-based, using an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& Kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser, in which you can select pictures to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the image size or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & Space Show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can click on the & LMBs; or return the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first characters of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the bottom right corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlists browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command line options of Qt and & kde; and Amarok also has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdir to verify why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Require require require 'Korundum' rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdir --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you'll find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the base for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most script languages enable the execution of external programs and commands. the exec () function is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are written to the default script entry. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default entries and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Add the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is alluded to. the script could now and zb; with DCOP functions further information can be retrieved (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newbuild indicates a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a custom menu entry is clicked. to remove the menu, you can use the DCOP function dcop amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do e.g. cleanup operations, such as storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration may also install script packets that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which optionally can also be detected with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will accept only script packets with the initiation amarokscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the other modules being loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & amarok. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist, rather than having to browse through endless menus. perhaps you only look for a certain title of thousands in your collection. with & amarok; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Perhaps you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlists browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still hard, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is smart, sexy and chic - just the right thing to re-experience your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually, in the base folder of the Amarok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Since & amarok; autoconf and automake are used, you should not have any trouble while compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them in the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& amarok; like most applications, it has some options to enable or disable the configure script at compile time. this is a list of available options.</seg>

<seg id="1216">Playlist to save, save the current playlist automatically when you exit & amarok; enable this option if you don't want to lose the playlist in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: if you enable this setting, & amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, are used. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">To keep up-to-date pieces visible when changing the pieces, the playlist window will roll up / off to keep the running track in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing the item to the context browser, the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is alluded.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & amarok; the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the use of different typefaces in & amarok; use the otherwise grey represented section. you can select scripts for the following area: playlist window, player window, and context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice of Custom color scheme, you even have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme. to do this, use the color selection enabled for foreground and background color.</seg>

<seg id="1229">The audio output card lets you select an audio driver from the drop down box. some drivers still activate additional settings in this chart.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & amarok; to search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, mark the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes to set up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & amarok to search for music both as well as their sub-folders.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & amarok; to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, incremental searches are carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & amarok to add all the found playlists to your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The Component Collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is necessary in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql Setup section is used to set up the database for & amarok; on calculator: enter the machine on which the MySql database is located. after that, the network port is entered, under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no additional KDE packets. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included in it, because & amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD assume that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of freedesktop.org, so Gnome will work, but Fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Taglib library. you can locate the file by typing in ~ / .kde / share / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this bug to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">In most cases this is because taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all libraries used by & amarok are compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.x, this will lead to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable autom. turn off if inactive for... in the setting of the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail opens automatically during a crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta information, but do not label them as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "file $ARGV" [0] doesn't exist "unless -f $ARGV [0]; my $v2tags = $mp3- &gt; get _ v2tags; print" Error while writing the tags from $ARGV ($v2tags, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script needs the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be installed with this command: Perl -MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: Mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">& amarok; s symbols in the status bar (chance mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects will be forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setpixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok is using the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd'which amarokapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any collimating Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf to make Amarok the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most installation problems are solved best by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help from other users or the developers. use the forum and the IRC on irc.freenode.net in the # amarok channel.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bowzilla is not suitable for searching for help. please bear in mind that there is only one fault if you have something about the correction of a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & amarok; only appears a blank playlist. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the start window was converted into the statistic window. you will find it under Extras stats.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the rating by the user, while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the playlist and select column View. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press release on your keyboard. or right-click on your selection and then select From Playlist to remove from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and let them drop there, just as you would do with other files. that's simple: -)</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device has to provide a blender. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to output audio simultaneously. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for alsa (Software-Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you search for the problem cause and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify a different Sink (eg. ossink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & amarok; already. do not forget that media must first decode. you can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. Streamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound servers operated with highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper suid is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">In KDE 3.2.x, there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this bug report. enlarging the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help well.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Use another driver (the xine driver has been heavily optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Center and Sound & Multimedia, Sound System. the smaller the buffer, the less dreamers respond to the visualisations. yes, this is an error, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & amarok; why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you need to register all the components. perform registry records to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help you can also ask in the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (stop Amarok earlier!): - Download phmpeg, compile and install it. then, run the grimpeg file, once as system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all the ffmpeg files in the folder folder of GStreamer (you will find the module folder with the support config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. now, start & amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1326">To create a playlist is very simple. drag the mouse entries from the collection browser to the playlist. the small text field to filter the collection eases the search for certain pieces. if you are content with the playlist, you can save it by using the button playlist to save it. you will find this button in the playlist's toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlist, you can add them to the playlist. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have enabled the playlist to import playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, please select Preferences audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD tracks in WAV format. drag the wav files to the playlist and then press the Playback button.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The audio CD function uses the protocol AudioCD: / and is not compatible with all available drivers.</seg>
<seg id="1330">The burning function can also be found in the playlist. just right-click on an entry and follow the Burn menu. you have several options for burning a CD.</seg>
<seg id="1331">& amarok; sets the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed that make working with & amarok more enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages using a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player, it also has & amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & amarok are used, including the creation of a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a running text display that displays the current piece or current stream. just below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current item. one click on this area changes the display of the remaining time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">The player window also includes a selection of audio-analyzers, also under the running text display. you can switch through the available analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & amarok; -Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display there are also the PL and EQ buttons. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window while the EQ button is used to set equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play-position-slider. use the scroll bar to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preference.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you activate the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that there is not in any other player. but don't be deterred by the abundance of functions, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation pane. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and performer. these three subwindows will later be explained in detail. they provide information on the current piece to different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & amarok, you may notice that the subwindow has been taken away. the information displayed there are now divided into other parts of & amarok. besides, the information in the statistical window can be considered (Extras stats).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this subwindow displays information about the piece. the title is the name of the song, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you see here how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">In order to display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images, which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist. this area shows the five most highly rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set what information should be displayed in the music subwindow. to do so, right-click somewhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual areas to begin playback immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This feature is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages using written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running yet, you can choose which should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & amarok; s collection database.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com based on the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping interprets only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - In addition, the pieces are grouped by performer and there is another division after the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list below Miscellaneous Artists.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping artist / year - album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection will be alphabetically sorted by each other. the interpreter will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will be sorted by genre and, among them, by performer.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adjust and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & amarok; will automatically revise your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own lots of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly beneath the toolbar. it behaves similarly in the list view and in the tree view. in this manual, you can find information about using this filter in the section on the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter, there is a selection field with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you have different time windows available, starting from the last 24 hours up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This deletes the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order into play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you will achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - this feature will add the selected pieces to the queue. this will make you play next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you are asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Adds the pieces into the queue to transfer to the Media Player. for more details, see the Media-Player Browser section.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - This will burn the selected pieces to K3b and burn either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for item information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) Move files into the bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm that, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">As a compilation, mark the selected album as a composition, whereupon it appears among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Undo the compilation - Change a compilation of the selected album back to a normal album. afterwards, the album will no longer be displayed under miscellaneous artists, but once more under the corresponding artist.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes handling a lot of playlists very easy. among other things, it also includes Intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. they use & amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with pieces in your collection, which have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Intelligent playlists are possible. click Intelligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart Playlist. you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow will be used for the connection of & amarok; for example, your iPod with & amarok; to be able to use your iPod with & amarok; in / mnt / ipod it must be included in / mnt / ipod. if & amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod to performer, sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles out of the playlist and drop them on the list of Interpret. if you're done, click Apply. thus, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. when the transmission is complete, quit & amarok; and solve the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden, which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file-browser there is a address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL. if you want to enter e.g. tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press input key, you can listen to music in the music .tar.gz file. now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist becomes longer than in the window, the attachment of files by simply dropping can be tricky. in this case, holding the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply drag the entries by the mouse to the desired place and drop. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the button until the text field is empty.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter between the search terms OR, search for entries that either contain one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then close the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this is the search for entries that include Mike Oldfield, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search engine, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not include a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something searches for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and clicking the right button in the desired order on the entries. the entries then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist's toolbar is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button to add playlists to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and Restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the center of the toolbar there is a unique, magnifying analyzer. the refresher rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as the one you have displayed in the player window over the right mouse button. you can set up & amarok; 's configuration via this menu.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons for the toolbar, for example playback controls and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up toolbars....</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information about playlists. it displays the title of the current item, the number of pieces and the total game time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval is displayed by clicking the mouse twice in the corresponding display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar, and deactivate the status bar option in general settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed through a click with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking the menu in the playlist. you can reach the settings of & amarok via this menu.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry will open the window visualisation plug-ins. there you can select the visualisations of & amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">This record contains a sub-menu with links to this document and other information on & amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in your collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover administration includes a list view of all the albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what to see in the cover administration. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move into & amarok; 1.3. with this feature, you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece into the queue, the playlist will appear in the playlist and the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the item in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>

CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and unlock the drive or discarding the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows you to select and drag files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with an appropriate CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headline has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for & k3b; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key signature to it below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct authorizations for burning CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the system administrator's password when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here general application settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work immediately. this dialog is intended to personalize and fine tune the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; -interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">In order to use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you are using the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP; functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; started. then type something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Next to the General & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; -program common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, format DVD and other functions to create new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Perform () void copyrif () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () .void formatDvd () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bproject-0) Alternatively you can get a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentproject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString Name) void createFolder (QString Name, QString) void addUrl (QString path) void removeItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString NewName) void setVolume eID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">A createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT create</seg>

<seg id="1495">& kaudio creator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many encoding which encode these wav files (compression-free compression).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudio creator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggprev (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. however, all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to install something myself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to encoder, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying a protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudio creator; cdparanoia to read audio data from the & CD. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device avoids the protection, it is not possible to bypass any copy protection. simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up has to be done once (the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration has been found), then the daily handling of reading a & CD will be explained later. this will (hopefully) lead to the understanding of the lean base of the user interface that you will often stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands from the main window. step by step, for example, you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">CDDB will start CD-data request according to the CDDB registry. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">To start reading and - if an encoder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup catalog - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default. it is to be noted that previously the encoder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager so that an already read file is selected to code rather than a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (like minutes, Piepsen) for program events (like read out the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudio creator; with different flashcards (such as encoder, for setting up the encoder). here you need to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also others such as' shorten 'or' monkey ', which may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important since both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is nevertheless provided with most distributions, but there are open licenses.</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playing equipment is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset Standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the unit. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR shared stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all tracks of a title. good enough for music from youths, portable devices and auto-stereos. but not good enough for better hi-fi systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320Kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you insist on having absolutely the highest quality without consideration for the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or automatically fetched from the freedb via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be passed / used with & kaudio creator; and the encoding program to create folder and file names, as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, adding the & CD; add title to the keywords when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameter of & kaudio creator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudio creator; parameters that can be used (= click of a button in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so everyone else can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; titles, artists, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note the translator) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is publicly available on CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt. any information can be obtained anyway with a bumble through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudio creator; actively select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can not be used with another (fake) address than the one installed in the system. in this kind of configuration, it seems, the email address will not be used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudio creator is set up to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online recall of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more exactly, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">Pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added to the encoding of the encoder at first opening. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for predefined encoders. more information on encoders are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a codec, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading list on it and if both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step, for example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure about what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame may, for example, be found with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission (eg; by trying to copy something into the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setting up of & audio creator; something that is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the code to be used for compression of music (lame) and audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them every time you read a & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the available entries of the device designations for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The Karteikarte General Settings. there is not much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only for incomplete information queries, so that you will be informed if data is missing for generating key words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The Karteikarte CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the computer while reading the & CD; to access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selector is easier, becomes a & CD; entry found, starts immediately reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory name / filename or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename will be changed with Konqueror &gt; tags and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">If you want to manually enter the database, deactivate the selection boxes and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database beforehand. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. set everything as pictured in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your area. on this way, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, as many firewalls use the protocol 8880 by default, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, because the protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screen shot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of concurrent pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, so simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, check it out to check out the CD; at the end of the process check out.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder where the WAV files are stored. if the field is not enabled, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something yourself using the .WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">To enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be flattened to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted when needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' Tagger for & kde; in the case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files to be coded at the same time: using a dual core or quad or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we've just finished the basic setup of & audio converter; this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a & CD. if you chose the organizational structure of your music cleverly, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk runs. we will create and set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been set up in the previous section as we are comfortable and the & CD; the process that is described in this section needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not included in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from those for one & CD; with succesful of freedb deforested data. therefore you will learn to enter the & CD; data manually, rather than pick it out of the internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD will be pushed into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, then locate the questions and answers section after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully retrieved from the freedb, all titles of the songs are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there is a window appears, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic retrieval of freedb (on page & CD), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but get data from the Internet, you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input of CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the item in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the 'Album' input field.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "the artist no longer needs to be entered in the" "" "Actual Title" "" "field unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for individual commentaries per item, the album's comment field is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name, but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, Album and Title of a piece and only 28 notes for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least to what & kaudio creator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information from the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders and file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the exported CD. in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', go back to the main window. simply click on the row with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current item.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next row in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown above the BOM.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you click on the button selection to read out the reading process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">On the tab, click the order window to switch to the order window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control orders. the first piece is currently read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You see this error message when trying to work with a code you haven't yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have read access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of pieces 1 in the format MP3. this allows you to read and encode parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is coded and a third order in the queue of the encoder stands. after the last piece is coded, a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudio creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so you can drag in & kde; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files (song events or text events).</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you quit & kde; quit while playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">"" "to play a piece of music, open it and press the" "" "Play button" "" "button in the toolbar, select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar." ""</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; (multiple pieces will be added to a collection and then played one after another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & mid; a piece plays off, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth using the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows on the left and right of the template and change the playback speed. in order to restore the original tempo, double click the Temp LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the Pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and other both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set what events should be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined using a song, so you don't have to set anything manually. in the Settings menu, you will automatically select the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select the text events or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played by the turn. in this section, you can see how you can use your collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find these in the collection under the point Organize.... Click here on New and specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on the copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set each of them in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to no other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection will not be saved. remember that if you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song with the button Add. it will again be the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic Add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when you open (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song, the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button forecast piece, the entry of the item from the menu item or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this doesn't matter as it will not be stored when you leave & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map implements General MIDI events in events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map that converts all the events of type Change patch to Bright Piano into events of type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need MIDI-Map, because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all the required implementations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of the keymap..." END Define Keymap "... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how to map the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard. general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the same sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and do not leave any line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument needs to sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a rifle shot (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which sounds similar to a gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (rifle shooting), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, no matter what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch where each note is a different percussion instrument (drum, basins, maracas, etc;) and not the one where the tone signifies the pitch of the ever-same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate sounds on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussions-channel. take a look as an example of the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and the second channel, do this in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboard players who have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15 according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the Channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will be defined further in the file name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch can be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio is where Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event with the value n, this will be converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used so that there are no decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM states that a keyboard which receives a pitch-benefit event with the value 4096 to play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the Settings menu, item MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to show the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the dot channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, therefore support & kmid; drag and drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">"" "" "" "enable automatic add to the collection" "" "Automatically add" "" "to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection." ""</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Temp LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -Desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a Karaoke file) or tacked (if I want to play a Karaoke file), just switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn automatic add to the collection, and the new one; file is added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatic Add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play also B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; LAGA (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; LAGA. at the moment I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; LAGA.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, bug or idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy simply write to me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; but before sending a MIDI file, you should contact me, since I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and doesn't get any money from anybody. I would like to emphasize that I only program because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use an FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a soundcard, you must compile & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a soundcard, except that you can't hear music of course.</seg>

<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, phono and phmpeg. the program is used to play video files of MPlayer or phonon supported formats, as well as for playback of DVD s, VCD s, TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not finished yet as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, check the page The KDE Website for new versions, or send the question to The KDE; User mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. there is always the window with the playlist. and finally there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that is only displayed when information is added.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. when you add an entry, your group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback will begin with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', TV and permanent playlists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not run. the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / KMPlayer directory can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the matching playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the edit mode is abandoned or another group is selected without equal to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will be aware of the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / explorer / KMPlayer / KMPlayer / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be disturbing at the end-animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo: & lt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the 'console' button in the KMPlayer toolbar. here is the mplayer output.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc like setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a flash with the swfdec-mozilla module is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even be added to the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To play the & KMPlayer; 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the mime-type application / x-shockwave-flash can be specified in the setup dialog box Directions of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to the loading of the browser module library. if no errors occur, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (View, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that always a given backend for a particular mime type is taken (of course only if this is also determined), this needs to be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards using either MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog can be found in the Settings under - &gt; Source &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the coding to be used must be found (e.g. it's PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since VDR's VDR support can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux expansion for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server, it must therefore contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by KMPlayer. at the time of the creation of this documentation dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, url source, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, they begin playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there hints how I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is to be run as root after the device is inserted. it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / cdrom is on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why do I have to check my CPU for performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1760">When entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for input of the text) and the corresponding line for closing the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the menu item Kile; LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allow the subdivision of the document to the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; -files, the back search function can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI; file [rendered independent file]] is created, jumps & Kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the usual output type of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back search, the elements of the DVI; file are plugged with the editor and once clicked on an element in the DVI; file, the corresponding section is found in the & latex; source code is the exact opposite.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used in working with several files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set over project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Express: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there is any error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is opened on the side of the door. it is not called a & eyepiece; after the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection boxes have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for speedy arrangement of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -commands for the division are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The choice panel Further is for inserting items such as keywords, notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a term for a section, a picture or another element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Referral: used for reference to a specified designation (choose a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experiences with & kbibtex; the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size. the written documents can be specified for the main text, the grooves, etc. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and restricting the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] defines the font name. if the font name is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s Building or the button's Schnellbau.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; automatically removes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Failure to compile the document should be searched for errors in logging. when using quick construction & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font name 12 will have created and only a few slits should have another font name. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ our and\\ end {environment} allows then to change the font size inside the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are considered only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restrictions (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, grease pressure, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italic print and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be displayed recursively with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: created a quotation in the document. the quotation starts with\\ start {ratio} and ends with\\ end {ratio}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Following the background to write the source code with the & latex; label language, then follow a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. to do this, at least one quote, a few passages in bold and italic print and a poem for application should come to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor-view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as for creating the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed (in the viewer) by means of file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar allows conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file is created from the & latex; source code, the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview search allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binaries. to do this, only Modern will have to set up under Settings boxes... Building tools.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the pre-selection search, the mouse cursor has to be positioned in a line of the source code and then click on pre-select search. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; the viewer is then made.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Okular; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; opened and bound to the corresponding line. to do this & Kile; in & Okular; set up as text editor (setup eyepiece... editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If it is not possible to open the & DVI file, an error can be found. if an error is present, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log message file explains the error source in the source code. in the editor, then the shortages of the LaTeX errors and gaps between the errors can be used. the log files always specify the line in which the error appears. to view the faulty line, the error in the log file must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the wrong line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the preset options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document may be written either from the ground up or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Common user of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file will be created. & Kile; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings box... Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by typing in the document class. typically, it is used as followings:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then choose your own template instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Columns; as an internal editor. & Columns; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different kinds of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & posters; and to experience its possibilities the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start there directly by reading the chapter's work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called via the LaTeX reference menu. it contains a detailed description of virtually all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search for different kinds of source texts and highlight them. for example, the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jumping marks. this is a special kind of bookmarks within the text. the menu entries edit hocks or the appropriate key pair make the jump to the next or last jump brand. this is also highlighted, so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile; though & kate; already offers excellent opportunities, were added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; -source code added. & latex; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code. the only beutiful thing in & Kile; is that the Absesses are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also applies & latex; -commands with a back button (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For the length of a part of the document, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the button. & Columns; offers the key-key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit, the following commands are included to the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore & Kile; for further commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the\\ begin {environment} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environmental commands, you can quickly get lost in view of the environment. this command will close the most recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups defined by parentheses {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right in front of the cursor bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right behind the buckled clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curly clip of a & tex; group # is sprayed to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">At the input of many disadvantaged groups clamps can quickly get lost of the view above. this command bucks the most recently opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple quotes are used as a seal. for the appropriate implementation is used in & Kile; the character is used for two simple quote characters. also for moving the application the sign 'is used. & Kile; knows this case and applies two concluding quotes for & latex; a.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insertion of double mitre characters can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Foreign-specific settings (e.g. ngerman or French) can also be used for German or French quotes. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift, Entries button & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break but also the command\\ item.</seg>

<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the\\ begin {environment}, & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and this will allow the completion of the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed by selecting a command. alternatively, it can be added by & Kile, so that a simple jump to these positions can be added to these positions using the jump brand NÃ ¤chste jumping brand and then the desired parameters can be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; Config file can be made settings to these lists. you can select different lists of lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as text editor of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call for completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the completion mode over the menu item Reset environment or the key-key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment will be automatically added and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the ambient completes can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile; recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item -command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; Config file can be made settings to these lists. this mode uses the list of completion mode for Frontex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports user-defined lists of abbreviations, which can be replaced immediately by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings box... Kile Versions are set up. as an example of a query list, the file is example.cwl, in which, for example, the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word completes queries over the menu Edit Versions or Ctrl Ctrl + Alt Space bar, the letter L will be replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins that & quantaplus; ladet, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. thus, the plug-in system becomes very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality at once and do not have to wait until someone builds the shared in & quantaplus; the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start with the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all contained plug-ins and add new ones. we describe every & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a memory location, & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on one project several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift, F7 Project Properties Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as both team leaders and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can search for himself from the list of team members who he is. this is done by selecting the team member from the list and hitting the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold as they are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of news and notes. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Besides the overview of your team there is another benefit by capturing the members of the team: it can be an event for information to be created to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later it can be seen how much anyone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that will add a file to the CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the side event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Preferences dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addressee may be a team or sub-project manager. see how such guides are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Inserting notes is simple. either the annotation entry can be selected from the Editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword can be entered in a comment section, followed by annotation text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a defined member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname of the nickname of the team member is, role plays a role in the project from the following possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive regardless of upper or lower case, but spaces around the parentheses and the: make the comment invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here, only via & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using Settings Quanta. this dialog covers some pages that are treated consecutively.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; concerning tags including car completion can be modified with this. entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Tags: big / Lumpy of tags: big / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal wholesale / lowercase meaning tags are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Upper / lower case sensitive attributes. normal size / lowercase meaning the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if checked, tags for which the final day is optional, this immediately after the & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not include optional tags: as above for all other tags except for ordinary tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update start and finish day: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacing of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding code during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detection of different types of files. using the default button, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files (where the coding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been recognized. however, this setting is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; periodically creates backup copies so that the document from this backup can be recovered during a power failure or crash when the program is launched. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Previewing and documenting can be displayed either in the Editor area or in one's own view (or documentation in a tab), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the default window settings at the next start is useful when the user interface changes by changing the MDI modes and andocking / appending views. it is equivalent to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning notifications area serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hook from non-requisites.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to modify the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source view in shared mode. see the different modes.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, which represents the representation of the Parser node in the document, can be adjusted in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the field of mouse click on the structure tree, it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structure tree settings area, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the updating frequency of the tree during editing and how deep when changing the structure tree can be automatically opened. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause cancels something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins are part-applications from a third party, which can be reused by any part-enabled application, at the most known & konqueror;. when pasting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in if it is not at a default location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the related folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "load component in" "" "Read-Only" "" "mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-Lese-KParts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is checked, then test & quantaplus; if the input information is correct, it also allows you to save the input even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging was completely new. support for the no longer needed built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin was implemented that allows different implementations of plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently there is only one plug-in available that adds support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the debugger plugin, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger if necessary, or it shares the plug-in to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that normally you don't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debuggen session Started the session. closes the connection to the debugger or stops listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to request a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger Edition.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variable as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution is continued. if it happens before a debug request has been started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will execute the next statement in the script without entering into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next statement in the script, where it is possible to clean up in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg, which they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more works by Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how to adapt to & quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how you & quantaplus; can help to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for brand and script languages as well as css; their simplicity and flexibility makes from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag folder contains two file types, the & descriptionrc; and TagXML files with extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbol-oriented toolbars of image buttons (above the editing pane), the text and instructions are more quickly inserted into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the file descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML Files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and the content of the property dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day displays. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars enable a quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a writer.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag Folders are nothing but a folder. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carry the name of the description language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but the only element type over itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, there are other tags describing how to display this attribute & etc; This is a just element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name inside & quantaplus is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface name and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag which groups the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the attribute text position within a dialog. this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog once (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag).</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; -declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but be careful & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt; text &gt; will not cause a leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check tagXML. a further dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check only takes place when loading XML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tagXML file should be scheme. tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example for a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "class _ name" type = "class _ name" type = "class _ name" type = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tags &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD machete DTD settings. with it diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = distortion 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD-specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can set up actions with Settings... to be created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action shortcut shortcuts. by clicking the user defined button, a key shortcut can be assigned; with KONE, the current key shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the Detailierte settings and if the action is executed, this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but on that it is not limited) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even the quick start dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This way, & Quantaplus is trying to find the script at the following locations: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in its path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are substituted with the current document URL. in case of a local document file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the unique text will be added to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods enumerated above, a script from & quantaplus can be used to receive the default entry. in the input field you can specify what is to be sent to the default entry. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, to the standard error output. it can be specified what to happen with the text written to the standard output by setting the value in the output selection field:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in any given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select settings to specify actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window opens the Edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the Tag has attributes and you are planning to use their use, enable dialog "Edit Tag" when available so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other Programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size other.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With the view that the day starts, I have decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is mostly seen as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startgt; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this is done via the menu with Settings... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue using other tags if there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar, or you should set it to a better overview by some separators in several groups. open the toolbar to set the toolbar settings dialog. make sure the toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how separators support grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar might think that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by masturbating all the symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Save them to the right folder. after RebeXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please match their descriptionrc, so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation to scripting language or the format language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if anyone has done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060">[source] Doc dir = Sec2.1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.1.html... [Context]</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation is something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Launch = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax = language.basic syntax</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a sub-folder in the tree with its own content. there is no known boundary for the box depth (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently on the top of the tree view & mdash; folder will be shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces don't affect anything, but be careful & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content portion is the area of the docrc file, which is used to form context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts documentation for mysql _ fetch _ array function would be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements separated by confusing (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc easily and after $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local / global use. then create a folder (as you specified this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this is good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the lost resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else to whom. at different places there is an email-send menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) send with email, send tool-like toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions will be reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication. in order to make an annual contribution, we recommend that the source of resources is ensured, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key after your passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New Resource Dialog you have to fill out the input fields (URL template can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool bar toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders can be started in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and the signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet by & quantaplus; it is supported to work by creating a DTEP package. however, creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is a simpler way to convert DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD load and convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">Doctype Definitions: the string that appears in the! doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand them and to benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus; everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be all from & CSS; templates to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emoglides the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the building views, the flashcards with information and toolbars. please look in, and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the mouse button with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all of the carts, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor area will lead to a further context menu on the edited document contents, such as basic editing steps (cutting / pasting / pasting), editing the tags under the mouse cursor, or opening the file, if the string under the mouse cursor is a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the tool bars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as default, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars will be adapted to the new features and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; PGT; insert into your document then click on the icon which represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (like armature), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) enable information on & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and roam. in the display with carp controllers are available for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation of building views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading, or deleting the files from the storage medium can be done using the context menu that is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc; It is open to you all possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the appropriate user and templates in projects are available only in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the scripting languages available. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the information available to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the information available to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking a element, a list of commands is opened with regard to navigation and refreshes the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, manquick attributes and namespaces can be changed. the entry system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two carts at the bottom of the window that can be accessed through the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document's markup. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will see the corresponding command. the toolbar's chocolates page is the option to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the site of the & quantaplus; autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in PATH in front of its bin. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a host of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML, developers from & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor would? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now widely on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be noted that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & node; developer community. & quantaplus; follow, in good application of free software, the idea of Why Develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; framework not only this is possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity dramatically. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is not in any way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the details of the documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or run helpdesk help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and looked after by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick-access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest entry being taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project templates, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts added characters to & html from clipboard inserting there, so that they display correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from clipboard into & URL, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost, to insert & URL; s used in the Anker Day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP script executes error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Turn off and switch the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries Forecast or Next, depending on the location of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Open an existing project from disk. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this enables you to copy graphic files into your project folder or sub-folder, and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available modes of transport depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in Chapter & Quantaplus, details are explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the tool bar type: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar, which only creates the name. actions must be set by settings... to be added. toolbars are saved using toolbars toolbars, or you'll be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the loading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; that you or anyone else has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD;. makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP; should be replenished without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and does not exist a write permission in the global KDE folder, the store will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool bar. if the standard (HTML) toolbar is loaded, in the Tags menu, there is a submenu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always available in the Tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar is denied when this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on them. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlight mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemata depends on the posters; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching sometimes may need time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode that matches the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will activate the appropriate subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog influence any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbars, or add which ones and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help according to the mouse cursor environment, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, as, for example, after filling the project name, the entire directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be set with Shift, F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to be entered, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.g..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. you can select multiple files or entire folder.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have the static content you want to download and change. in case of server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP; Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be hailed when files that are located somewhere in the project's main folder. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder, and you can make an accurate selection of gutters.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the subwindow profiles or Shift key Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible) that are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, even files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles section, Uploading Profiles (see below) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile, by showing its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration window, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration window, you can switch to event actions and add, modify, or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a certain event occurs, such as the backing of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default opens & quantaplus; the last project that was open. you can't currently influence this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project open... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus is closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before you leave when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders are also behavior, but the entries open and open with... in the right mouse button of the context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if there is only one profile available, the button will be blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by the programmer. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsecure password on the disk drive option is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a risk. use it at your discretion. the password will be stored on the disk, so it cannot be easily read, but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in one project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the project menu or the project toolbar, accessible via Settings toolbars Project toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps to increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are best stackable above the toolbar menu. the addition of toolbars is discussed below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols on it can be set either using the context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, it can move other actions like toolbars, rename toolbars, or set the toolbars to see which actions should be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and activated actions that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up toolbars in the Settings menu... and set settings for actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; commonly used templates such as a common filesystem with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you set for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each presentation prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples are found in the template-tree among global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates new documents can be created. usually, more specific documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. a simple scaffolding for the purpose and arranges the work in the appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template-tree among global templates. see for more information about the Template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be included in the documents again and again. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire sites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure as you wish (XML;, & HTML,, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File as a template save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this happens, you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template to save selection as local / project template. alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the selection to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for this, such as drag and drop or paste over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project files, you can click a folder on the right and create site template, enter a name for the template and back up. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can pretend headers and footers or dynamically link with & PHP; create, insert files, or link them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, click the folder and right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as eleventual attributes are eroded.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the master folders in the template list. if a root folder is set in a way, it would deactivate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows prior or provided text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows for a whole presentation to be presented with the appropriate headers and footers by copying contents into a folder with special headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -editor and VPL; & source editor, which is accessible via the View menu. the first mode substitutes the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back if necessary to the source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; -editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -editor on a document that & PHP; contains, a small green icon displays the Vohandrite of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; in order to edit it, the source text editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are visible in both the source editor and the VPL; editor in the source editor and in the VPL; editor in synchron mode. pressing F9 mode will activate this mode, pressing the active cursor from one window to another, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source text editor can be set up using Settings Quanta. depending on the choice of VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow ones.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select document properties. this allows you to edit invisible tags when working with the VPL; the document properties dialog will also be called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; this will help to reduce the encoding process.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list makes it possible to change the contents, e.g. keywords on the Name and Keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS-rules are the new way to design your pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS-rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the meta elements.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS stylesheet by pressing the file-open button and selecting the file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Cursors are used as in a word processor, by moving with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves in a peculiar way. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the back button or remover button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way over the toolbars as in the source code editor. it is to be noted that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an armature day, surrounded by text, must be removed from any other surrounding armature day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the table assistant or the Listen Wizard are disabled. they will work later in the & VPL; in this release the tables or lists toolbars must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparisons. so why & knot 3? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kvil3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, lots of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, just copy it to the clipboard and insert it into one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (base) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kvil3; also helps you to merge and merge all folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the merge merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kv3; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoyance if no one changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, you can simplify the typing by simply typing out the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kv3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 -o destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows you to manually typing filenames, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. opening dialog records your selection and shows it again next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merge of folders will be initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C however a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can do this later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with settings. here, you can set options before starting to merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kvil3; allows you to drag text parts from clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in open dialog you don't have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag & drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes, a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't remove anything from & kvil3; only the drop down of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag & drop of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The Info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest over the line for a while. then a small help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you see the color which differs from the file. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge) well to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the abstraction column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line break is activated, the line is displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison window) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [changed] when you edited the result. usually, it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to find next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each difference is also a conflict that must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing; this is only a placeholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps again choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a selection that you may copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources Ignore the options numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys on the left, right, high, down, side to side, end, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the display window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the insertion key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the Merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-picture Abroad) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the flag to the clipboard, you will need to automatically copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if enabled, it will automatically copy whatever you mark, automatically to the clipboard and skip the manual copying. be careful with this option, because you may accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed\\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line end of the source files, so you should use & kv3; not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of recently used files will be saved automatically when moving and restored to the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; Kdiff3 Set...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialogue also provides typefaces with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the chosen typeface does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be scanned. on these systems, the knob tightens automatically an unregulated color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tablator character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the input of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. then, the manual copy to the clipboard will be omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kvil3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return sign '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, others in turn store only one line of line '\'. usually, the default will be disabled. if this option is checked, this option will be disabled. during merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In Automatic Continue Mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict continues.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the section on scanning of folders and performing a merge. see for details under documentation on directory comparisons and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already exists an older version, the original version will be attached to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you must quit and restart, so that the change becomes active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for coding, a short notice appears, which is the local code. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted. since coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you've edited a file, you can specify which coding to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII) With this option you can specify the coding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress the emphasis of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded title column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. by selecting A & lt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will appear next to the normal one second oversight column with the information you need.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines. just leave the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparison window side by side or above each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as preset names for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first pass to this external command. in & kvil3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your needs. you can use this feature, for example, to cut off disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first pass to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command was specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to provide the user with more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all of them follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $. now, the\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line comparison. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and any hit will be replaced by nothing, i.e. deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several substitutions at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the substitutions. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / replacement / SCHALTER' However, perl needs some details. where used\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the preceding '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor is maintained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the line-balance algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you are using a normal preprocessor, the line-off preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you inadvertently fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kv3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate merging and display the simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just have to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as the base. if no destination folder is specified, it uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start the merge, select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress. if you cancel the folder of the folder, only the files listed until then are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kvil3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double-clicking on the object or by double-clicking the arrow keys for the left / right. the list menu contains two functions All subdirectories can be opened, and all subdirectories can be opened with which you can unlock all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge operation cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed of any problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As can be seen in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then also folders have the same color. at folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying of B (or if B does not exist, deleting the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copying of A (or if A does not exist, deleting the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronizing mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified, and if the option directories are syncing, then choose & kv3; the necessary action, so that both folders will be identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; copied directly after merge & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the New File instead of merge, then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying. if the files are different, but the same date appears, then an error message appears: files are identical, but the date is identical.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, a file is processed after the other. it status column displays heel when the merge succeeds, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only shown when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds) or all entries at once. if you have selected all merge actions (including all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you did not specify a destination folder, then in the Three-Folder merge mode C is used as the target, selecting B as the target for two-folder merge operation, and when synchronizing A and / or B as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder, also displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped by the particular entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the menu menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to merge only the current entry, select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears that points to the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box will appear with the options Opening, Simulation and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select emulate if you want to see what would happen without the actual changes made. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kv3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge-window (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select the directory merge again / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kvil3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you lock the merge (F7 key), a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you choose the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), it lets you select another action for the entry or to resolve the problem in a different way before you continue to merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, the entries (in the current session) will not be noticed again. even if the merge is skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered as completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings - &gt; Kdiff3 Set...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon; valid wildcard: '*' and '?' (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically created files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this can be adjusted specifically to a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other file systems, a previous point is marked. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Links to Folder: if the option is disabled, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is enabled, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recursions).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Complete analysis of each file by displaying statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text. (specify a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders with a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the changeset date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal. this can be useful e.g. when copying the modification date. please use caution. this option is disabled in presetting.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical. the results of merging files will also be saved in both folders.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the newer file is proposed as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and obtains the extension .orig. When an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of individual files, not only the merge of entire folders.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the merge-merge view stays visible in the merge of individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want that, you can switch the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. nevertheless, there is a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also directly merge a single file without having to run the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency using KIO Slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contained. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, empty string &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes using the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder. then a file is always accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or modification date from the original deviate. (note the option Confidential of size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as a difference Viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first starts the built-in differences beViewer. to start KDEVELOP, press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In KDef3Part from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a part, it takes & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select KDiff3Part from the Preview menu. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kv3; run as part, it only supports comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now heist Kompare) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for quite a long time and learned a lot by stalling in the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or will go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably not tell the configure script to KDE. in default, configure is installed in / usr / local, but KDE does not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc).</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only one non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. if similar lines are next to each other, this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was too big so far. you can always restore a particular version by choosing a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, it suddenly appears; No src left; appeared and the text can't be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To be able to use all functions of & kv3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kv3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kv3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used, you should not have any problems with compiling. if difficulties are encountered, please report on the & kde; mailing lists of this.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Umschalt removal) copied to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Umschalt insertion) inserts the text from clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you need to re-read the folder with the update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files are not copied to the target folder when merging. if the destination folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">If you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual working spaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, exit them or move them. this works both inside a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual worktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to other applications.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & pager; the movement is possible both inside a working surface as well as on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager to set up... and exit. if however, on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Beende. the commands cause the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows inside the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is enabled, the name of the virtual working areas will be displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual working surfaces. if it is shown together with name, the names will be marked with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is enabled, the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is enabled, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default icon and pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & pager; main window can be determined: classic lets & pager; in a 2xN screen, as from pager applications appear in some other Windows managers; horizontally, all virtual working areas in a horizontal and vertical line display in a vertical line, which is very good for displaying sideways on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be modified in size, display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then select switch settings... makes dialogue settings appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the dialog. however, you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or vi. if you do not have a write permission for the file, you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you must enter the key windowTransparent mode and assign a value to it. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the package is kdebase, you will need a functioning install of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer survives for a while at the same location. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click brings pain. furthermore, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that arises when you click the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also feel pain caused by the use of your computer. if you suffer from pain related to your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: also if & kmousetool; avoid pain that is caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse, and as with all the ergonomic relief funds: the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and executes a mouse click as soon as you briefly interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Now, move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the mouse button to the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag it with pressed mouse button. the intelligent moving requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This refusal time must be blocked after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click will execute.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent Move is enabled, the shooting time is activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool is set; after the mouse-down the mouse button is waiting, before releasing the mouse button again, if there is no moving of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking on the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double-click. this moves will be saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ stroll.txt, but it can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the reaction time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the Rider General. there's a slide bar sound buffer, which you can set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; this feature is currently only available under & kde; this feature is currently only available under & kde; please consult the respective documentation at GNOME or other window surrounds to find out how to run a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Revert all settings to the values that were set when you open the dialog. if you already pressed the Apply button, the settings are reset to the user's state after the last push of the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2509">It is best to use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent moving should be switched off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later take the smart shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response time of & kde; in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not show a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the rolls. they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. you can scrape the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool, when a shifting process has just begun. if you use the intelligent shifting in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this will restore the status of & kmousetool; it will return and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor back where you want to have it. but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to have a keyboard. safe zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the title-lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent moving, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent moving is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely to mark text to copy it into the clipboard and then insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse at pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent shift when you are just starting to use kmousetool; instead, select text instead: run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. as a result, the mouse button pushes a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the delay time starts when moving. later, you can use the intelligent shift even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use, the Xtest extension for & X Window must be installed. this should be the case on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker, and these are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button briefly as soon as the mouse cursor hardens. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and causing pain to the cracking of the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Filters are processed before being sent to the speech-dispatcher program. they are useful for improving pronunciation, to replace misspoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working of filters, it is important to know how the speech-Dispatcher program works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders will resume.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages like & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News has the highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a web page, you can start with & kmouth; notifications are also news. read more.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you initiate from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of extended texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queue, with the exception of the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such reads, this issue is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Readers. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character Chain Replacers replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be provided with predefined string replacement filters that allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set boundary detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs divide text into individual sentences. this can start & ktops; faster with pre-reading, since only the first set must be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the set limiter filters. at the first start of & ktops, a set boundary detection filter is automatically set up as an input. you can change its settings or add more set limiter filters, but beginners are advised.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to select speakers is to try out. switch off the choice of speakers and select text to read. check on the speaker selection, change some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. you will have to do so, of course, more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with pre-reading, since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">If the speech synthesizer does not support this function, you can pause or cancel orders on the card card.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limiter filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">The set boundary detection filter compare text with a regular expression for set ends and insert a tab character (decimalcode 8) at the set boundaries (tabs are automatically removed from the text before filters). note that the standard set limiter filter retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied to & kde; -messages (cnotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limiter filter, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card selection tab, you can override the subscriber settings for the application. the card display is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the carp card speaker). in other words: no subscriber properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use the most suitable speaker with all the characteristics of a speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; otherwise choose & ktts; otherwise select & ktts; the speaker is most likely to match the originally set characteristics.</seg>

<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property has priority over other properties. you can also set several markings.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language is available if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>

<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktts; it was finished. you probably need to register GStreamer. with GStreamer 0.8.x you need to install GStreamer. if the problem is not solved, you may need a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be sox installed and discoverable by the environment variable PATH. some synthesizer modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the card for subscriber units. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML. (this is because HTML is converted into SSml;) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSml deformerfilter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetwork.conf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which enables management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetwork.conf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings will be displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetwork.;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Setting in the & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetwork.conf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetwork.conf to display the device at all and allow setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the Network Setting option is selected at the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and release. by selecting the setting non-once, the setting can be made permanently. next start of the network settings, this selection will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are grayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in system management mode, you can enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode, all functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Reiter network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the Reiter network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed on the network interface can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface... set up in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The automatic mode removes the TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further setup is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option Manually without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration can be made. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field Network mask, the subnet mask is set to specify.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. by ping in the & Console, you can determine if the address you want is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be enabled or switched on as required. turn off an outdated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched on as required. turn off a enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specify the host's IP address in the local subnet that mediates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support replaces a full domain name through the IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requires http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will solve this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution hosts a simple management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS entries can be sorted by selecting an entry and down or downgrade in the list with the buttons down or down in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Clicking the button Add... from the group Computer to the name resolution can be added to a DNS server. it will add the New Name Servers dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the machine to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display the dialog edit.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list Named Calculated Calculator describes computer name-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used during booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, remote networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list of Named hosts contains some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this version of IP still in the test will replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button. if the well known computer has several alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name that is known by name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog you want to edit is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & Console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface can be used, such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is enough; not, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended by experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile and knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, and in the second, all of & network.conf; configurable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to be implemented in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in external networks, at the & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact point that has a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot simply be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own machine).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 net address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.conf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically modified at DSL connections so it will not be surprised if there is another content found there in case of active DSL connections.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar that also provided the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be integrated by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; retrain the tape and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. do not recognize & kdat; the pre-tensioning force on the tape is not required, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the pre-credits, search for the appropriate index on your disk. if this is not found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; there is a change in the symbol for the tape to see that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape must be formatted before you can be used to store data. if your tape drive assumes that a tape must be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the tape. floppy tape drives usually require formatting the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape name and the capacity continues & kdat; proceed with formatting the tape. all data on the tape is lost! after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically mounted and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a security profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is initiated, the dialog opens up settings for backup. in this dialog, you can check the selected files once again and change the settings for the backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you confirm the settings, the dialog will appear. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Rightclick one of the archives and select the menu entry Verify....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure is started, the dialog box will appear for verification. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the check.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog appears check. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the Restore, the files that are to be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog box will appear for recovery. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you confirm the restore settings, the dialog will appear Restore. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can re-create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder, where the backup is to take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder. folders that are located on other filesystems can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Executing incremental backup. to see which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can do the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding option of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is integrated, the command is loaded to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; lock the ejector at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the release of & kdat is activated, automatically ejected by the tape. do not use this option for floppy spreaders.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; change the hardware block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must tell & kdat; in any case, the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the name of the full name of the system is where the band was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the age in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar -archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemblog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system supports various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background. the task of & ksystemblog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is backing up the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog allows experienced users to access information about problems that arise on their server. & ksystemlog; hence tries to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and analyze the protocol files of specific programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemblog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different kinds of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemblog; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemblog tries to open the system log. it will not appear to you, and it opens up instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most probably not with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log, for the normal user normally no permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter strip to filter according to a selected criterion, or after entered strings. the list of the log lines is now automatically altered so that only log lines will be displayed, which will only show log lines to match the selected filter. in the default setting, a protocol line will be displayed only if in one of the columns contains the string of the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be matched with entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the log file system log, select the process name, and in addition, in the filter bar, select the name of a process, so show & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to see the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color as protocol lines of level indication. the color display of protocol lines can be turned off alignment dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to display a specific process (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column Process. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use Filter Panel.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump to new lines in the main window's context menu to view all new log-in lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemblog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find more current information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemblog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemblog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & ksysv; System V Init Editor, rather known (and named so) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system rapidly develops into the standard for controlling the program start-up of the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD style.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could attempt to change a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel first looks like / etc after an init file.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The sysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of direct in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to run when running the system or switching to another run level. system services do not include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it. you can also set a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you want to change something, then you come to repair it by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does init start and stop system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level that only lets httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; run. furthermore, I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry in the range of available system services to one of the six runlevels to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between level levels or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position) only if it moves out an entry in the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new area. to only copy them to a new run level, you must explicitly choose from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sort number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to include the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to activate the different working areas (available system services, running level 1 start, running level 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it with clipping into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel by inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input key to change the properties dialog. use the Tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard running leveln and now the machine is constantly running. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-use mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; designed to run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary configuration programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) can be terminated simply without notice if their configuration files are not present or configured incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either you use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the record store in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user name and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed when you have extended system settings. only when you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users will create a mapping card on which you can make individual settings. additional flashcards appear in the case of shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card appears in the case of shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least a built-in file system space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the File System field with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The group of cards groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the field Primaries group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the Users or Group or click on the Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change operating systems add, remove, change and more.</seg>
