although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican L@@ etter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts revealed the murder@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Method One , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only increased my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me how to deal with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague expressed it , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number of nom@@ ine@@ es nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans supporting this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I was not able to recon@@ cile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , who receives people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ umps Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung also agreed with the current editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix S@@ uns game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intoler@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who is fighting the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ tur@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values embo@@ died through them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump made his way to nom@@ ine@@ e Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , pres@@ ided over a man , in spite of - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their congreg@@ ations are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , it is hardly possible to forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note . ) : as much as &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; p@@ un on white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much like whi@@ pl@@ ash injuries ) , as the great Van Jones called , has killed exactly what America has done so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have always , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of an Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says himself , would nowhere else be possible anywhere in the world .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they shou@@ ted and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
Mr. Khan finished with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for whom his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ump country , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t let their love of music spoil themselves
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
picture of the OE@@ A @-@ O@@ AS fli@@ ckr user ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province with the kids of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
the fact that the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 o@@ dom@@ eter south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ ger ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with its musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico is known for its abuse of drugs and ban@@ dit violence .
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and sing with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located at the top of the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paragu@@ ays capital - play instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers started turning into instruments under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all made of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as the music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra and so on .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning :
first it was very difficult , because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates about 1 billion tons of garbage each year .
those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can effectively combat illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law@@ break@@ er of this kind along its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ sed against the ship . they refused to dock one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries administration . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia for pl@@ under@@ ing the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was founded F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stop illegal fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , which is extremely difficult to trace . therefore , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , can harm the illegal fishing of ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once imp@@ eded by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail &apos;s pace with which information was circul@@ ating between individual countries , actions are happening in real time , with trace@@ able on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange , for example , lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also very carefully tracks the activities of ships when they move on the open sea using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships fishing in prohibited areas - such as those who suggest that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such examinations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license , where they were on the road and possibly if they have a criminal complaint .
on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay the numbers of pun@@ ish@@ ments , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means illegal fishing is not worth financially anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting company committed to fighting illegal fishing in Africa and supporting F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the so @-@ called platform was created to regain estimated $ 20 million lost in turnover lost by eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network each year for illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake lic@@ ences , speci@@ fying fantasi@@ es , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international co @-@ operation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ complete control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are not running my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , the closed front functions .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed forged licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO , who also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be located by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that combines different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i find ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Prot@@ o@@ ving Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data to display the position of each vessel in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get together with neighbors to get a better picture of who &apos;s doing what is happening - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and consoli@@ date their resources into the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project that allows a global system to prosec@@ ute ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only det@@ ra@@ ct criminals , but also deter them .
ships that were previously un@@ licensed and hardly expected to have consequences know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i meanwhile have a 33 % increase in fishing sales since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars are lost annually by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined forces , the West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; Safety is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia has been able to report its first major triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and used tow@@ ing nets , which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong signal that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating further : demonstrations in several cities with the goal to &quot; rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &quot;
road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the Pres@@ idency of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos;s mandate .

after the government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the removal of the referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the reg@@ ression of Venezuela ) both of these demonstrations and arguments can be found against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Bar@@ inas low@@ land region , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ north federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation is steadily deterior@@ ating , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the removal of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change , but in the end the sec@@ rec@@ y of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rate is among the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial end ) , and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country a chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round Table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is time for Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide Civil Stri@@ ke and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

on Twitter , pictures that tell of arguments are pil@@ ed up , as well as reports of oppression and mal@@ treatment .
especially big waves sm@@ ote the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statements against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise one could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the rounds , which depic@@ t the extent of repression per day :
in this way , the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many of the government &apos;s representatives had challenged the validity of the call for a referendum procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
my@@ t@@ eks media labs :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fak@@ ed .
here is your removal !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and would rather be engaged in c@@ logging critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches increase more and more in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than to work or go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of CÃ³r@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investig@@ ates crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept family secrets for himself .
in the situation at that time I thought that was ok .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child of 15 years you don &apos;t realize that you are being manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .
directed by Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ an@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testi@@ fied before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child has chosen for himself a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :

make sure that they will not dec@@ eive you one day and I will have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ ine@@ an Revolutionary Workers Party .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ cause the prisoners are tortured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
on the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance of the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ rack , where the stolen objects were put off and kept me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open room and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I went in and saw a couch , where men were tortured .
it looked like a camp bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they were fixing the one end of a cable , and the other end was attached to the body of the person who was confined there .
they seldom caught a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it out with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell again and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied and tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian which was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with their face - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people chew@@ ed sil@@ ently on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you kill me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were several rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero has killed and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero &apos;s civilian , who was also accused in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial , charges the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the Memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way where the ab@@ duc@@ tees came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the det@@ ain@@ ees were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above was supposed to be laid .
this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time at the age of age I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was at the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military symbols that you have opposed to an enemy you have fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , painting , money ... then this is not a war loo@@ t but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who steal a car on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you autonom@@ ously .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
that &apos;s how my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a coil jum@@ per made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to home .
at that time the defence accused me of being a con@@ jur@@ er in this crime . I said no problem , they can burden me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once children have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but what the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ?
why kid@@ ding children ?
one day , my father brought a girl home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I asked myself again and again : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been possible to put them into prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did these people not have families that were handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something always remains .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I accused him of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience on his account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and wondered why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first ad .
I finally realized he was a criminal .
no one can blame me for being bi@@ ased . I finally put out against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended in August 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended sentence pun@@ ish@@ ments and in nine cases sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ it@@ tal claims .
eleven of originally 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and taken to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silence chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , an Argent@@ ine@@ an organization founded in 1995 by H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research was 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful car drive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in K@@ YO@@ TO , where you can extend your driving licence .

adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where one can pro@@ long their driving licence , witnessed a particularly failed translation last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older car &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was fal@@ si@@ fied on a shield , meaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; fal@@ sely - but also with malicious intent and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 @-@ 20 September to electronic ad@@ ver@@ ts in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n newspaper , which appears in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t for older people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the incorrect English translation was removed first . the designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture exc@@ used for translation errors . furthermore , it declared that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the following about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are really sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News spoke a little more extensively with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents in the country is quite a reason for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the above @-@ mentioned re@@ porter brought to light what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seemingly pose against older drivers :
the article on the translation error Yahoo received , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So wrong is the translation at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not very few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the web@@ page En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , two important skills are needed : passive knowledge of the language to understand the source text and active language skills in order to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that trans@@ lators in the target language should not be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate English into French - not from the French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers who want to learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees can make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is best rated as the best , is made to a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ckr user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the conf@@ using and enig@@ matic movements that arise by machine translations show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest British form@@ ulations in Japan , including the enig@@ matic prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ckr user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may still be acceptable or at least harmless , but by large corporations or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto is hopefully making use of a more serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; &quot; &quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nav@@ ision con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online .
later , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV is no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups that oppose the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the association was caught and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to gain access to the Internet .
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again closed .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially during periods of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting about protests since 2014 . back then , the Commission on Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is surprising that it is still cheaper to buy two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ in@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly delegates its sessions .
earlier investigations carried out by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique whereby the DNS servers will answer requests for certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds faul@@ ty or refuses to request the request when visiting such a website .
we confirm a DNA lock : @ el@@ la@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast on Thursday , April 6th , was suspended when the V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who carried out the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was put into custody .
Fl@@ ores was beaten as he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back on stream .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it more difficult for the Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other crimes that have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before she graduated from university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one from which has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she started working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as a cri@@ adi@@ ta , Paraguay has more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school .
the business is very simple : a large family with little money transfers their min@@ ors son or their under@@ age daughter to another more ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over his head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to spend inn@@ um@@ erable days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be aboli@@ shed .
this practice called cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ Eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas , especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the cri@@ adi@@ ta generally guarantees silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , it is the family that finds its daughter in the belief that she will complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family that takes up the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that otherwise would not be educated and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it until many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon occurred , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military family Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra defeated Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were responsible for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; compla@@ ined Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to un@@ punished children &apos;s rights .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be directional - if for the first time in the Paragu@@ ays story a case of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the Every@@ day of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the c@@ aribbean , in which her father worked , had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work .
her brothers now had to work all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went further to the school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in her employer &apos;s house , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she was still time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning , the more leisure she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve but didn &apos;t get unlimited food either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the kitchen &apos;s library than food out of the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings , the master of the house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince her not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he considered it intelligent , but did not keep up with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would again learn &quot; bad habits . &quot; so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i , would again speak their mother tongue Guaran@@ Ã­ at home .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible for them , they explained .
but it was perfectly clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken is har@@ ass@@ ment and the har@@ ass@@ ment that cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , at the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ Eng@@ a .
society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning personnel and n@@ anni@@ es in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is P@@ epa Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a municipal coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad had five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very nice , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author of the ad switched off once more :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report of Cri@@ adi@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( an economic system during the Spanish conquest , where the Spanish con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of the Guaran@@ Ã­ had to pay tribute , and the native population had to pay tribute to them ) and that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery , in which they become light victims for abuse and exploitation .
the social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power is the key to understanding the phenomenon known as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill introduces Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , edited by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted in favour of a draft bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations governing the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is accepted by parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up which is in charge of granting citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of the adoption of the law , users would have to register with their real names and ID numbers on the site with their right names and ID numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine .
the bill , composed of six par@@ agra@@ phs and cur@@ sed in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration . it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul S@@ att@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a us@@ ername and password from the Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation Ministry to get through the fire@@ wall blocking Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information on their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , this means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Legis@@ lative Assembly and the Constitutional Commit@@ tees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ized and assured that no aber@@ rant nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those intended to threaten &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the northeast of Iraq , the animal rights activist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian Leop@@ ard .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards stri@@ pping through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this particular le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ard in the wild is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist Raz@@ a passion@@ ately loves another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and advoc@@ ates that protected areas for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an Region are set up .

documented in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for the northeast of Japan , has documented the progress that has been achieved over the past six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a tremendous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture has been a peaceful pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , experiencing both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left whole coastal towns off the map .
for this purpose , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident , and alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , which progress has been achieved six years after , in order to rebuild the life of the local residents .
the detailed report of the paper includes statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement buildings ( ... ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
nevertheless , six years after the catastrophe , it is still possible to reloc@@ ate ev@@ acu@@ ated homes to the final replacement buildings , ev@@ acu@@ ated by means of accommodation ( ... ) .
after the triple catastrophe nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people living in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes .
nearly 40 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , who were hau@@ led after the disaster in shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three concerned pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools affected by disaster have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land , have grown extensively .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land have been destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in the &quot; nuclear barrier area . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent of the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal residents have felt it more difficult to earn a living .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ees . she asked her about the status of re@@ building and how her receiving had changed in relation to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o paper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey in order to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local residents took action to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents found that still not enough was done in terms of disaster prevention .
how it is about those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has increased its attention to the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , disaster @-@ induced , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
from 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 thousand people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement buildings .
after the state of 2017 there are still 40,000 inhabitants living in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees are older than 50 years old . they are well known because the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries that speak a different language , the differences appear to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often sees that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that ultimately the world is very small .
as a result of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders .

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva in a popular photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had beaten him with a strike on his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures nationwide .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police , in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident of active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire suppression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ al@@ z@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video footage recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several plum@@ bers rush to him shortly afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus living in another federal state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Or@@ tel@@ la@@ do calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :

police ass@@ aults
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
polic@@ emen at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for or@@ ators , rubber stor@@ eys and tear gas .
Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loud@@ speakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specifically reported a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their front pages with a photo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o favor@@ ed a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken wind@@ screen than the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a specific cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of material damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ char@@ ted Villa@@ ges in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular community Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ag@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - no matter where there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after lying down the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and pl@@ ung@@ ed daily into the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , rising every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period because they have been preserved .
that was something he didn &apos;t expect .
N@@ ene is very fond of having heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the municipality has already seen better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories which could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nonetheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the export of raw sugar would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban president F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then onwards , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the breakdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repeated the most &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
these were officially auth@@ ored documents that differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and date .
all of them were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister was able to appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories still operating in operation , &quot; he affir@@ ms .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he participated in the shut@@ down of the factory which he helped to build .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
Cuba &apos;s most developed industrial area and the most important work@@ load generator has been extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the facilities in the communities in which they were located were created .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the community Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to dis@@ courage them , they also stopped to asp@@ ire to the road , which also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories .
they were sentenced to replacement parts .
without a future perspective , many young people suddenly for@@ so@@ ok the region .
a food factory has been created in the area , production is not even used for the supply of the municipality .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , but he does not forgive the lies that one told him .
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to retirement for 65 years , not because it lacks power , but because he is bitter .

young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with themes that are important to them . they do this by hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of traveling workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by Ped@@ ago@@ gen David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop invites participants to find topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into meaning .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section of road in West Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ en@@ mag@@ oo@@ st@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the North@@ star hip @-@ hop group , which gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available , as well a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one ever cares for me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we as a youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will raise ourselves one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also go ahead with our youth
so they can do what they intended the creator
in the commentary section , the reader and advocate of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ able ( which is also published on his blog and published here with approval ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( for the most part ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( real @-@ time ) , &quot; sculp@@ tural models of dishes &quot; ) are exhibited by every dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ bo@@ oter district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually that they don &apos;t even notice them . however , a new trend is turning it into show@@ y cell accessories and gad@@ gets nowadays .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist to the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic dishes decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin &apos;s fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in Essen@@ ti@@ als is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also produced this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple pe@@ eling your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the cell phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic .
some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura and nit@@ s@@ rogen is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and palms of dried salmon .
you can watch other whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter on h@@ ash@@ tag # ...
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and gh@@ o@@ sts regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reports of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a car@@ tel , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the congreg@@ ations who have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ eri@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug trafficking &quot; ) , which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories about people who came into the fight between law enforcement authorities and car@@ tels .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describing the project this way :
organised crime lets us not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves today for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for the tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I &apos;m alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother who is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are in charge of my father &apos;s insurance , but she doesn &apos;t pay it because they ask for a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ portions a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , fragi@@ lity and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of journalists and journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
her contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known disease and sen@@ sing journ@@ alism for several years now .
every day I come by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different to this or consider it as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ cker ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me this is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something is happening to them .
I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people &apos;s in@@ action is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village can be justified by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being rebel@@ li@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they don &apos;t stir and are still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main district district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals took money from their business for month for month , until they had destroyed not only the business , but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you &apos;ve lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of it never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are away from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kid@@ nap or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega has published the article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , fry potato , warm tor@@ till@@ as and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years earlier , when he removed only a few blocks from his home , who saw the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as a force ma@@ stered by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizens &quot; council for public safety and government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office amounted to 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to average average of 8.5 Mor@@ des per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ eri@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , which aims to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ckr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this post and the pages to which he links , include images on which violence is represented .
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising rum@@ ors or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how about the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or false , tends to continue to exist .
take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images of news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of sleep holes that were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to that of the tan@@ ker .
officials describe a fire@@ ball which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby , which was full of people watching the Football World Cup .
houses burned and cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies lined up on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story does not come to an end .
over the years , the same photo was taken up several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses had dramatically reported atro@@ cities to which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images could the follow @-@ up time be displayed metap@@ hor@@ ically .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ resolved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from DR Congo appeared again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
indeed , this mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
one more step further personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely relate the image from DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash announcement , published by the United Nations , those who were able to escape could be@@ atings , rape and several deaths , some by burning .
while others reported from the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following , who brought together these descriptions with photos from DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , fal@@ sely claiming that Myanmar &apos;s president Th@@ ein has said that monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of DR Congo to photograph this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , also wrong@@ ly attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but did not have the image associated with the DR Congo .
the Global Range of Fal@@ se Information
traces of these false coupling dates back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
using an inver@@ ted image search , you can see how far information can cross borders .
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the predicted image from DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private sites , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded fake reports , some others have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have bor@@ rowed examples of impro@@ per use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which page they were published . by doing so , we want to present the range more clearly than by language alone .
several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use may come from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been linked to each other ) .
here are some cases that can now be fully felt ( on the card in orange ) :
card : news frames .
country examples of false coupl@@ ings from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to sites or servers that are still available for counter@@ fei@@ ting or fal@@ si@@ fication .
the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , are probably also examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

France , 2015 .
Twitter posts after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; clearly did not see pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that refu@@ te this .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was divided as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , which expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and , on the other hand , del@@ egi@@ timi@@ ze the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are prosec@@ uted since the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government issued a right to judge what it was intended as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news and photos of international media , international human rights organizations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this judge , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ec@@ ules that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech are running and used by extrem@@ ist groups to set out that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ opoli@@ s or political provo@@ cation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community clearly shows that the image of DR Congo is NOT Muslims showing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein had admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in killing Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Katho@@ lische neigh@@ b@@ oured news page An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , has explicitly stated that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later put into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image of DR Congo emerged , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to those events that were presum@@ ed to take place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre of a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this one in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false .
from the Embassy in which the image was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ ine@@ in Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced himself .
there are other confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye is also not fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the spi@@ der and isolated in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original piece of 2010 , the picture eventually carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong subjects or frames ( fra@@ me@@ works ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is assessed compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
but a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
there are dozens of people with social media who un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly share the water around a tragedy .
is this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and that the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent images has already been discussed in detail ( here for example ) .
one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , there is a concern that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers and taking them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be replaced by the context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive kind .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take account of how international they can be .

the un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able blog posts the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. op@@ plac@@ able ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in each language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these inv@@ alu@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ sage ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist a stub@@ born attempt of a simple translation .
a word or phrase is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is required in order to understand precisely what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online @-@ list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
the blog contains , for example , words from the vo@@ gue language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - sample your parents in recognition of how they have been trying to keep you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they mi@@ tig@@ ate other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this side want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are much appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite students here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and floo@@ ding catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually fights at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ ag@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have gone over the shores in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
following an opinion from Sri Lanka &apos;s disaster centre on May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missed due to the flood and mud wave .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe locations .
the ra@@ inf@@ all started on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos provide an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods exac@@ erb@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ all are already on its way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . the village of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a yesterday .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are being completed for transportation of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages .
different organisations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ bas .
please call today the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster centre is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then for@@ warded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also launched an &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floods and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , provide security and help to residents in need .
this has prevented the loss of further lives , with Sri Lanka &apos;s population now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

use approved . in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and a dear friend .
I trust in her my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one minute we call even slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next , we will be sharing rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , other channels of slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
you have to dis@@ m me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in a variety of ways . but somehow we are all plu@@ gged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who like me do not fit into it , are being dem@@ oted .
to be dispos@@ ed of
I don &apos;t stand alone with it alone .
this has even happened to the poet , whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love ? what is love ?
peace ? peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran , and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry by the day he died .
but in the western conception , the religion of Rum@@ i was extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting constitutes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting ima@@ gery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should be saved .
the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dra@@ gged the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to disc@@ ard it .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the past three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative will fail to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forcing Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , both of which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group is exercising its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women , leading movements for change .
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has filled our collective imagination such deep and faul@@ ty that Sik@@ h @-@ men and children often become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
about 1.7 billion people
in the news industry , we do more than telling stories based on facts .
or alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed to find out where seven million Muslims are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ speaking Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York . sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan real@@ igned herself to the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were Muslims and Americans .
but am I myself a Muslim and an American now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my handy pocket knife , which all Muslims bear - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all of the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected for additional safety checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of emin@@ ent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists , and inter @-@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are being produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ ic@@ ity machine with financi@@ ers , think tanks , and experts for false information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger that tears a woman &apos;s head@@ sc@@ arf .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms , whis@@ per@@ ing her Arabic verses to the protection that seal the Qur &apos;an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

belonging to me is the image of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters ; how they win a contest for the art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me to speak when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God : Allah says what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - over the centuries - was colon@@ ized by an &quot; empire , &quot; which a company founded with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only master .

belonging to it is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as with the game risk .
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , because he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I was ever and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops spread over every continent , apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy occ@@ ured the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white bombing .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer cry , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ine , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple d@@ ashes , but fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble tw@@ o@@ fold &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia in this ambig@@ u@@ ity .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is set up in the Muslim registry , which started with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that sh@@ uts its limits to people from just countries who are bombing it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; list , which largely targeted Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we carry and the bombs we drop to Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , North@@ western University scholars showed a scientifically in@@ appropriate picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in evolution .

the Con@@ vers@@ ations That We Need To Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply concerned to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are coming back for decades to recognise the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous forms that we disc@@ ard in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to grasp our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; The viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; S@@ app@@ el Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this gives me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet existed ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who made me an un@@ bound Muslim today .
things that I left here like a lo@@ af of bread in my speech .
things that may spark memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot;

why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars can be fought and enth@@ ron@@ ed people by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , was scientist of Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of what my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have not pres@@ idents , while bombar@@ ding already broken lands and &quot; other &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .

initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
story@@ telling , by fli@@ ckr user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way of communicating with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported on a different initiative by Steven Bird , the uns@@ ett@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of language of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project apply :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that assume diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to it is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the listening to appreciate , to make sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even though the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience insi@@ sts on it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional tale from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language Daf@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art that are typical for her country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the story of the h@@ are and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand it . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling .
Puerto Rico calls for the US to re @-@ establish public debt
with the aim of re@@ vis@@ ing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which rose to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . the march started at the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ an Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizen &apos;s front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the E@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Church Convention Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of fixing the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt are being held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed salary which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we become black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our reti@@ re@@ es will not find themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico necess@@ it@@ ates a broad restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , measures imposed from the outside will risk being rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration wore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nacht@@ wache for Light and Truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : collective Research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available here roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction , it says :
this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
we have no information since then about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push@@ es for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process from time @-@ to @-@ day extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and attorney N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the military police had taken Bass@@ el as a &quot; top secret &quot; command of the military tribunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that they were contacted by people who presented themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
however , his where@@ ab@@ outs and conditions remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a key role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the head of the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that Bass@@ el founded , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes was more predic@@ tive than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lis@@ ations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influence .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do all this , to wipe out this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ clam@@ ation that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was detained .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together for a year in the book .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s Happ@@ ening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose my mind at the moment when we embrace ourselves ,
that it doesn &apos;t matter to me any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with my passion ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s arrest , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
a year goes by , my soul
during your stay
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the c@@ ages of monsters
Bas@@ sels &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under regime from the regime were tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our call for the hope we have to do for the last time .
Mozambique : director of corruption , convic@@ ted of corruption , res@@ igned on previous post
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was perpet@@ rated .
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defend@@ ants due to em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( around 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice Cam@@ ba@@ za ruled between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for its re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the request , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to take back its old post , as the company did not carry out any disciplinary proceedings after its detention .
however , many inhabitants do not call the action good .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) condemned the company &apos;s decision to put the director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP .
what we are aware of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the counter trading .
the firm was apparently silent however and caused no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had expi@@ red .
he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company that he can inflic@@ t harm .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is fond of paying for his silence .
it is disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director does not have any mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ts him , I can &apos;t believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served himself in the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long imprisonment .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te prefers to remind Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison which will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , one @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ators .
one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions was that &quot; an ambitious man was capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and released .
and today , the company , in which it poll@@ utes mon@@ ies , is under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ hooks fest@@ spiele ( @ az@@ je _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or split@@ ting belly . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of Eastern Indian origin , or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bur@@ m@@ ese let@@ tering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with racism this day , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several bur@@ m@@ ical words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( split@@ ting b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ urt is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it sol@@ ves all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Facebook .
what you should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words nearby .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech are a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to cut off nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cens@@ orship of cat@@ ch@@ words is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to inform his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook policy , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to hide , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring even more hatred within the various denom@@ inations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and prohibited words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heredi@@ tary cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had only a little bit more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has provided users with a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech , but were still removed :
used with hom@@ olog@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have applied social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also inc@@ ite violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in the territory Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to take control of the balancing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites .
but rather than simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better current to look at context rather than relying on code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago concludes with the child marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo of Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously passed a law prohi@@ biting this practice so that the marri@@ age@@ able age is now 18 .
before this amend@@ ment to the Act , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities were held in practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ch Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group who conven@@ ed representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , as that , age is not the maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under the age of 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children with 15 had already been married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 2.8 percent , and with 18 , it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements seeking to aboli@@ sh child marriage laws followed at the bottom and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome .
but not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying to the critics of the child , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sort of religious opposition caused tensions in this rather un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the draft bill altogether .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the child marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who ab@@ stained , so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
now only the president of the country has to agree and declare the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country posted a status update on Facebook , which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ res@@ at : the bill against the child marriage was decided in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws of the child &apos;s marriage had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who is a minister in the Ministry of Education , said :
there has been too much time and unnecessary talk that has concealed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth every price .
while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , stating : , , Excell@@ ent news !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Act has been approved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
torture Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was :
the marriage @-@ able age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the amend@@ ment to the amend@@ ment to the Act was adopted today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties agreed to have voted for the law .
the marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is no longer permitted by law .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ birth abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought it .
happy Bir@@ th@@ day .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a potential catch comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hind@@ u organisation .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj proclaimed his intention to take legal action , the law was to be adopted , and he now seems to deliver on his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users desired that the debate would approach the issue differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we think instead of discussing so broad@@ ly , instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply say that the state that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in advantage of them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , even though there are laws which they prohi@@ bit .
hack@@ ers controlled the office of the national prosec@@ utor in front of national protests on the Russian national holiday
screen printing of the message posted on Sunday early on the Public Prosecutor &apos;s website of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l District .
on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ ded with the Day of Russia - the Russian national holiday - the website of the prosec@@ utor was hack@@ ed by Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l District . hack@@ ers left a funny message &quot; Sta@@ ying home .

at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the side - but in the cache , however , it remained intact .
to be on someone &apos;s head
on Sunday , the Office of the Public Prosecutor announced Y@@ ar@@ News that they were hack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia @-@ page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contradictory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright law in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured .
compiled by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing platform based on crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ ade .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy internet users are used to use stra@@ pping tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia , as reported recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
Turkey is the second most famous country in the world after China , when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to lock , several mirror sites ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and often update ) are now di@@ pped up .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia articles on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( calcul@@ ator calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the domain name system , making it difficult to complete cens@@ orship .
in spite of the legal ban , the content is still available .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we &apos;ve heard the news ( about the block of Wikipedia ) , we set everything down to take sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content on decentr@@ alized and distributed fashion .
this can help users view at least all Wikipedia contents even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia participated in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ny of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Le@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar lun@@ atics sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni told Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member , as well as collabor@@ ators at Mozilla im Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for conservation of nature

photo by S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry with badly positioned motives and well @-@ balanced colours .
this motivated him to wear a camera and try to straigh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ ag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw the attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation in his work helps him :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when I suddenly called me Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida castle ) . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river @-@ dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started grinding pictures ! !
S@@ ag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .

late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
also I was home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the King of Bu@@ har@@ k appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals S@@ ag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with great care avoid saying the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that because of the social pressure they respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of a fake court from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a and expelled from her family and the village community after she spoke to a married family .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also is common among men . however , they have far fewer assign@@ ements to fear , if at all they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , joined a unique club and thus became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ mir , which is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and advoc@@ ates the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS @-@ infected people , and leads these clubs .
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her panel discussion was women who did not name her hus@@ bands by name .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the discussion about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women can easily identify .
to speak lou@@ dly the name of her hus@@ bands is a custom , which they all solem@@ n@@ ly uph@@ old and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini points out :
this tradition att@@ ests that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about it until this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home , as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name .
with this confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem at U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women never have the name of their hus@@ bands to pron@@ ounce .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she only disgu@@ ised herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole exer@@ ted fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
in an adren@@ aline rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try home to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation dealt with violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the cin@@ der red point on the forehead , indicating the status of the married couple :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zin @-@ red dot if he did it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped carrying him .
the other women have not stopped completely with it , but they think they are now in a better position to choose themselves not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example , how our identi@@ ties are tied to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things al@@ oud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only bore sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a salad @-@ cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of arguments and discussions about the advantages of their own dress code , morality connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own pair of kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question as to whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have done little steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of her husband .
some , including myself , make it , but only when they are alone and are not other members of the family .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it &apos;s not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first visit to Japan of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th of this year the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here have become clear quickly that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cult band &apos;s music is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese central schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it belongs to fans , of course , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar locations connected with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Ma@@ thew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( New York memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be quir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year as well .
and of course some companies also use the fan@@ base in terms of market technology , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?
today I will listen to Y@@ ester@@ day and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
this is how the day is going to run today .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men are de@@ ported and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be in Mozambique &apos;s target of attacks .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ trafficking , probably for dis@@ believing purposes , is concerned by the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government has now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi .
there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man could bring gold or bring wealth , declared the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led the UN to conduct a mission in the South African country in 2016 in order to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
bew@@ are of bald men who travel to Mozambique are aiming for ritual attacks , the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an police warned of the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ per@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for supposedly dis@@ believing rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans .
in the last days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor S@@ nai@@ ppa on Facebook , suggest@@ ing that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique confron@@ ts :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE ONE Mozambique , TH@@ AT I am ashamed of a country in which the people would have shame to go on the street , as if they would be ashamed to offer sex against good marks , and even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor the bald or bald , for dis@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic , &quot; aimed to attain fast wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police spokesman Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ headed :
the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an authorities are very concerned about the murdered people .

a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , actively engaged in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our meeting in the Arab blo@@ gger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ sels wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who made themselves the insi@@ der of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ sels &apos;s stay and constitution was unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a learned from Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we pay tribute to Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the Open Web Movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations that have set up for their release over the past five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , including the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly disappeared by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans died in custody , including Am@@ nesty International &apos;s international human rights organisation .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the arrested Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to cancer of the liver in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( endanger@@ ment ) after having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ u case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and nar@@ rator , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to call for calls from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are fully wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised a number of reactions from abroad .
United Nations ( United Nations )
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Bren@@ de refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a stand@@ still after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it has nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December of last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
the European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the top @-@ ranking diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as announced on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to aboli@@ sh all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
Korea , Democratic People &apos;s Republic
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad announced that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want him to have the option of treatment abroad so as to help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy request drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the foreign ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on July 7th and 8th .
previously , diplomatic sources told the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns about whether the fuss over Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada Korea , Republic of
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervis@@ es the room in hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak with anyone outside , including his lawyers , to contact and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights to exercise these rights .
France - France
France &apos;s State Department urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France would ultimately receive it .
Taiwan , Republic of Korea
the Council of the Agr@@ arian Affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance toward those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu , of the governing Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the dise@@ ased intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very worried in an explanation on 28 June about Li@@ u and stated that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished , led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore to be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that we are not a country in the end .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in the face of what appeared to be inevitably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears again from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system , really non @-@ answers .
he tar@@ ned the corresponding questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls upon Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country is our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clear up this point if it was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore .
as An@@ on published his commentary on the blog , he points out concerning reviews that one should start reading the entire script of the conference so that one can understand the context of the statements made by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore to cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw for decades a party win ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another matter .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that really , and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country do the sovereign rights of Singapore return ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore make their military service , but do they defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay back our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tends to fa@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this set seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country chi@@ ef@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series that will reveal the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and show another fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor of Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I most asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered poli@@ te to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook with anger internally if they are kept for Americans but I don &apos;t mind that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ...
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are poli@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you were to conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : to be referred to as &quot; nice &quot; means to be di@@ ligent - like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle but tra@@ gically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double @-@ lon@@ er ) .
if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
to be harmless is to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that happen around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major property of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool poli@@ ten@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbours .
we lack the warm hearted , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau passed the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dies Thailand &apos;s jun@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the jun@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det girl ) of the Band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells of what prec@@ ep@@ ts his girlfriend does . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not expressly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 songs .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was even blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these photos of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may relate to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which grants the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Army absolute decision power over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; change in imagination &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the jun@@ ta as critics .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army that monitors online content and prosec@@ uted people who were accused of being slan@@ dered by the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand sets a strict stance against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ esty &apos;s offensive ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 martial law was declared in Thailand .
two days later , a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at of the army came .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before entering an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences if they insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games &quot; that was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the 2014 protests .
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering very slowly in east @-@ east Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ den@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Dep@@ u@@ ties , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the majority of Russians and par@@ ch@@ els live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 some 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this area .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native older man .
he starts talking and it &apos;s hard for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nonetheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with remaining magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ov@@ ka , which still house one or two families , is recognized by the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out from the window of a destroyed home .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they move back immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an elderly woman called Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia forever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she is supporting her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; is home to migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez over@@ runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with kind permission .
on the road to migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and golden earrings in a ted@@ dy bear form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on their way through .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,@@ 50 dollars per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but there are still hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants here .
sometimes , tells Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , people come to full mini@@ buses and from the top of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already been sleeping outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings her to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys drugs that she cannot pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey exhausted .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ch@@ ee ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to be able to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
seb@@ as@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
the family had heard about other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the circuit , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans are often travelling together and that Afri@@ cans are already speaking at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup Football Championship .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months now : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her going again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family welcomed migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African immigrants too expensive .
he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez told me that he fled from people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to ext@@ ort money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered him their roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again .
in the ais@@ les , travellers should consult their phones quietly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full but she is nostal@@ gic because of those who left .
like a proud grandmother , she leaves in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with afri@@ can hair lich@@ ens , which you made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she presents her briefly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repe@@ ats her every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;ve gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which they called the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities also tried to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the police message it was clear that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; damaging information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gen &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network .
this app with min@@ ors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while messages on digital cens@@ orship in China mainly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( which is based on Twitter ) , which has published cens@@ ored messages in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen cho@@ os@@ ed the residents to decide if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ano make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( see Sec@@ urities Central ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which indicates that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system , thus providing unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the City Council &apos;s instructions to minimize dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all branches of government , government and affiliated organizations , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the orders of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi by order to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; to be registered by the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for quite a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : all scre@@ aming after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both from within as well as from the outside .
one that makes all honour to their name .
one who has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but if reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors , the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the Earth moves on the axis of the un@@ holy . it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like dar@@ nel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was silent , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not make high demands on a city that is stuffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
during the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the electricity supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several times from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends joined me ; we allied us to a beautiful picture that filled my expectations completely .
in such a moment , you are aware that you are releasing the Spirit out of the lamp , but you are simply not interested in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you have scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service .
I arrived there .
Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear you scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to sh@@ out if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes turned to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you &apos;re really wondering what to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was due to my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my case when I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you in my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary and his father right with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed proposition lies in my nose right up to this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a psychological torture that I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a hall@@ way to the individual cells .
I remember all the details before I enter the room .
differently from that time they probably have allocated a bigger cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one single prisoner , and I must immediately put it in place without waiting for permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the bureau@@ crat left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested communication method : beating the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ help &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a distinguished middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no marked facial features can be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
maybe he was moved to one of the big cells .
maybe he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ar is a li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to ch@@ ase all these crow@@ s that are on the fruit in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries hear , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that Schwarz was the colour of corruption until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this the secret was lifted : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mail card and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view .
this is not a house here that is not a country ; it is a curse which they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their clan into a hero .
I enter the interro@@ gation chamber and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the expressions that der@@ ailed him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I am used to not responding .
I can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and strikes have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished if I didn &apos;t do anything to make this penalty .
at punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your scre@@ ams .
give it the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure yourself with it and you can &apos;t hold back your scre@@ ams .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t like him yet , which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector or if it belonged to normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to show us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the series .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t really enjoy it , which is why he attacked the electric bar next to it .
electricity enjoyed my whole body , enough to supply my whole district .
my half @-@ naked body stretched out on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
that must have been around midnight .
I decided to lay down again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus mit dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry about terrible things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move away , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always kept me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he locks himself to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ spotted lips .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ a@@ ye@@ es ( about : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate active activist opposed by the conservative majority and questioned their established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his home town Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not constra@@ ined in his thinking , and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special reluct@@ ance against US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who attempt to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugee from the second generation &quot; - he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I &apos;m a man , &quot; while in water sol@@ dered Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during that time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the che@@ eks of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you look into neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan - to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan said a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the legitimate legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to choose &quot; intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not simply be shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b moved traditional sex organs to Lei@@ be by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently uni@@ denti@@ fied unknown woman , whose arms and legs reach up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the inn@@ um@@ erable women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who they should trust .
in recent years the number of &apos; honour kill@@ ings &apos; has increased in Jordan , leaving the un@@ official out@@ war@@ dly .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ ors in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a 1954 international law on crime , women who are exposed to the threat of domestic violence can &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman .
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music is also very popular and is well @-@ known for not shy away from themes that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit allu@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was fed up with politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are in essence political can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ ander . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated stri@@ k@@ ingly often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ genei@@ ty or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and les@@ bians &apos; rights and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to find out later that his comments were ri@@ pped out of the context , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a processed version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b adverti@@ ses the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not dis@@ agree with Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ die , a poet of the 8th century , still remembered today thanks to his hom@@ opho@@ bic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ die , who was supposed to work once on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service established several former members of the Association of Te@@ ach@@ ers and members of the Association of Te@@ ach@@ ers , argu@@ ing that they had critical comments in social media about the problems related to the corruption entr@@ en@@ ched in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - that &apos;s what H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks like - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also about &quot; experiencing them . &quot;
perhaps the region will come closer to a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and artificial kinds of demo@@ cra@@ cies .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue and resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is thought that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated also in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the festive carri@@ ages , the drums and dancing were handed down over more than a thousand years and came from a time when armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched into the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ i , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time now : two fixed carri@@ ages are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of an 18 @-@ meter high @-@ end car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and straight raz@@ ors

rarely , outward appearance and personal care were as important as in this story because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate job like the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the Pacific coast , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug trafficking are common@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more normal citizens to move into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can reproduce these intri@@ cate hair styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; competition , which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts face each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in the hair@@ dresser &apos;s art , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported some of their achievements :
in 1995 , we were the only secondary school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to offer affection to people who feel expelled ?
this is precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian activist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga of the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la recon@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( Let@@ ters to Recon@@ ciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ illa fighters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( Colombia &apos;s Revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the sign of the peace treaty was so important that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
before Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of genuine reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , have been exposed to war rhet@@ oric , and around the clock their weapons have been borne , must now re @-@ integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians could join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s day , but those who need them much more necessary .
he continued to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year .
&quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March at one of the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the politi@@ cian student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a representative of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to enter , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a le@@ thal weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate .
perhaps he was tired of war , was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there &apos;s a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have learned only how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices - new voices
at the start of the event , students and some leader of the F@@ ARC have come together for a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC had already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the Organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State looked upon the whole of Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard their hearing yet and had no right to vote , and to recognize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings turned up@@ side down by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have been killed and done so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , Archbishop of Cal@@ i .
the Colom@@ bian was informed that peace would reign after the dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to resort to arms , to stand up and protest for their rights . and that is fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and life in front of Kad@@ y@@ row
a map of Ch@@ echn@@ ya , with surrounding autonomous regions and countries .

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ men@@ sum@@ ova and whose first publication took place on the OC Media website .
homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
in horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there has not been created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that deal with the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , throwing a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested susp@@ icious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ lady , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt that she was a woman in fact since her childhood .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
she moved out of fear for her life in the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer assistant in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ lady who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents made the lap through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was about to fet@@ ch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still dish@@ on@@ our the family , you cry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had got it all along and started crying .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : what records were you put in - in those of the men or those of the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dated , my male name is still on it ; but the doctor knew and put me to the women .
I am very grateful to him for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
I received threats last February .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they set absurd demands : some told me that I must prove it by going up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what could I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You brought a monster to the world that has sh@@ amed not only your family but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to my mother it became too much and she put a rope around his neck .
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later a car with a dark window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 on it stood under the window .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them without registration , without ID , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : just with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , it &apos;s a tab@@ oo subject .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to look like the person she recalls from her past - that is , my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for that , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who settled in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ram@@ adan , but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of the Ram@@ adan , and he did not lock out a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with that I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; experienced through blood grati@@ fication .
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relative or who were dropped by their relatives in order to face Kad@@ y@@ rows judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can present them as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically immersed in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports about it yet . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else wouldn &apos;t it have allowed these people to shave themselves ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve been wearing my hair for ever .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known throughout Gros@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in serious cases !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ li@@ zation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally dropped us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short loops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never cro@@ oked a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ read not on the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say it to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed that they were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never ch@@ ased and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city .
who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , gaz@@ ed at you at once with suspicion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic deterior@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : what activity do you follow now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
aside from that , I am still active as an activist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t spend a cent on it for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I discovered these people myself when I par@@ ked the type of influ@@ enza .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ es who have the cab@@ ar@@ ins who , the Russians , have what ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something .
I meet so many men here from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mos@@ que and fasting during the Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think about transi@@ ent to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of experiencing to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to become so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a sharp increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i , on August 27 , arous@@ ed the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to cope with his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who wish to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ eg@@ ast@@ ral Hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ations were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hang@@ ed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families due to the persecution on the part of the Iranian government and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab @-@ Arab community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took power and in 1925 saw great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields emerging in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population only gets little of this wealth .
it is often a victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime has systematically refused the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs to work in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of tribes , the waters from the Arab areas to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are diver@@ ting .
these dam@@ s have only led to devast@@ ation caused by dro@@ ught in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi people now rose to 81 % . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co @-@ operation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activist living in London told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not preference to recru@@ it Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to make a living outside their home country of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi must endure , human rights activists strike an alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and knowing it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoided .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside .
for example , women still earn less money today despite equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women stum@@ ble at a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on gender still continues across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I am suffering double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to speak on the skin colour , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my lord , &quot; in order to reach the equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is an institution@@ alised form of racial , motiv@@ ating violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migrant background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin colour to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind , referring to both sex and skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging to a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical respect a distorted and mar@@ g@@ inal@@ ised being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural enrich@@ ment to promote their ego@@ centric programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the over@@ lap of skin color and gender . some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins to a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which has been called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call for separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a woman as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life has neither b@@ yp@@ assed , nor ignored , nor rejected .

again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern throughout the Kurdist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a explaining his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , the pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ R@@ Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ land Alliance - who advoc@@ ates and works to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , less significant sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed communities , their stories can tell in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women presents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weeping women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ mu@@ jer ( # soft@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had been violent to her .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for abuse , the official announcement of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez was also of no use .
a few days later the second woman with@@ drew her complaint .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women make a complaint at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to being victims of violence are in general report to law enforcement agencies .
cont@@ ent@@ 1 strikes and statistics 2 invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does nothing unter@@ ni@@ v@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays law : good approach , inadequate implementation of impacts and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really mal@@ treated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are different statements and reports , which do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office had 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of polic@@ emen came from the police .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts . here , too , 86 % of the advertisements were made by women .
in the advertisements 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women talked about psych@@ ic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
these statistics , however , do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an woman minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; every woman in Paraguay is ref@@ unded because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 on every woman who has been awarded for physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she announced at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a separate crime , the law enforcement authorities cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year .
until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to its estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the mental force - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had enjoyed this so long ago from Carlos and did not leave him before .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay in order to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women , all of whom are victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ tori@@ as case , everything began with psych@@ ic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ tori@@ as advertisements for the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support .
she led a process against her former partner who developed into an im@@ penet@@ rable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays law : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but are not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , known as the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # for@@ ge ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees that it is the case that Fem@@ izi@@ dis should become a perpet@@ ual criminal off@@ ence and to punish the har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the text of the law was changed in some points to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law that feared that the path for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tion would be lev@@ elled , which is generally forbidden in Paraguay and pun@@ ishable by up to five years imprisonment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft law fores@@ aw most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence currently have to bear , if they simply want to refund and receive a secure accommodation , to impose the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence no longer be regarded as something normal .
whoever is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are kidn@@ apped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to report such a long ad until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after a newspaper ban continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned Az@@ am@@ n newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the tan@@ ker .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is serving a one year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after completing his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has held the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sul@@ t@@ ans rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the intelligence service , the public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of press , to limit and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict and block peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which corruption in Oman has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ Level Political Parties to the Justice &quot; in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page from Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested upon arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS was the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information gave the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , was forbidden from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place in Mas@@ kat on 26 September 2016 .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of dis@@ ruption of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and of slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es amoun@@ ting to 3,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to 1 year in prison and a fine of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i issued a deposit of $ 5000 ( $ 13@@ ,000 ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence of imprisonment .
the appeals court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the Court &apos;s decision to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the government of the government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister introduced himself again to the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to restore the publication of the newspaper .
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom has been viol@@ ated in Oman recently .
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Afgh@@ an authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Afgh@@ an authorities to :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman might exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association , and the right to peac@@ efully gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , image by agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and the lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping establish their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Louisiana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi Healthcare System .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think of the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed somewhere else .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipient instead of being a mo@@ ver himself .
the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa vs. Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often , it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that are challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazine articles only make available against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been in the USA salad since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only limited by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many let@@ tu@@ ce types it can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents tend not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cro@@ oked leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as grain or car@@ tons . as a result of this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate expon@@ ent of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but in the meantime he needs longer because his work is more and more complicated by more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around which I have to d@@ rank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads .
and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all of the features are already patented . &quot;
however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and anywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salt at the Out@@ red@@ geous variety in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station and tested whether plants can be grown in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( open source seed initiative ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted software .
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US breeders can undertake to freely use the seeds bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders allow others to cross their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not to sow immediately - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
a glo@@ omy outlook
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si member of the Board of Directors , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection .
seeds also play a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; he says . &quot; those who want to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetables is grown is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to freely make their seeds available to others . in contrast , their approach is in contrast to patented seed and plant characteristics .
Foto de Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool shr@@ inks un@@ ce@@ as@@ ingly due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights available on plant material , which is thus always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found that about a third of all car@@ rot features are protected as intellectual property , making it impossible for plant breeders to be used either at all or even more difficult .
there are still no such estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that large @-@ scale cultivated plants such as wheat are still patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves right up to those , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before , as the changed conditions are much more difficult to predict due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities .
however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property inv@@ ests other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties innov@@ ate . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees it different : wait 20 years until a patent is running , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed to plants adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
however , Mort@@ on &apos;s main argument is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to facilitate farmers their work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features ourselves .
the plants they form themselves and as breeders , we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret to nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si executive board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety breeds also its own values in it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whom mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , most smaller seed companies manage to survive without patents - either they reject pat@@ enting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

in addition , Mort@@ on believes that breeders would benefit from the elimination of plant pat@@ ents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties on their own in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; for 20 years , it is protected from competition with a patent , which makes it quite simple to me . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the USA seems to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an open @-@ source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Os@@ si &apos;s commitment to breeders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding vary from country to country , which is why Os@@ si &apos;s obligation cannot simply be adopted one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patents of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for open source seed systems , states that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems for which the official launch will be launched next year .
a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has put together a database for seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report published by the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes that more people will soon recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above them .
in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities have sharply critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Le@@ ave in spite of this attack and the spot@@ ting of the Egyptian law and the constitution to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to uncover in this part of the world and to give victims a vote .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 web sites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Al Jaz@@ e@@ era &apos;s Qatar network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of sei@@ s@@ mic barriers to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ d.@@ 5@@ K
in addition to the AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he writes for sites and media that are not accessible to Egypt .
now the blog , which he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
B@@ logger , the provider with which also Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , on the other hand is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the locking by the government and reflected what it means for him :
the blog to ban is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ Sis@@ i ; and although the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) They managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words : my words have influence , albeit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now , after locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . these resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers that were possible to circum@@ vent Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access .
the situation is also worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed against these actions in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air @-@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for ten years in Rio .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper said the motives for their decision :
we will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that happens in the civili@@ sed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : it is not normal !
this is the only alternative so we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , explained that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper around the world with a martial law in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial the newspaper continues writing :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neg@@ lect of public service .
in memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per state , Rio is ranked 16th , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is one of the largest media companies in South America , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for years .
these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to capture a fav@@ ela by using a massive police force and to permanently station@@ ed a unit there .
in the beginning , this led to a decline of violent death cases . however , after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people .
this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war . this includes entering into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
a week it is now time for the police to climb up the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
amid all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
Quelle : the Hollywood Reporter
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly through the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute , The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , assume that the massacre was committed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus , leading to the fact that villa@@ gers are locally made or transported through tunnels and control points .
through years of block@@ ade , traditional food like meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ a how they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ ni@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional food in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; becoming known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ hu@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the planting of mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la at Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations from Can@@ Do until Monday , 4 September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds originating from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before proving their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tank . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mould throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
dis@@ sem@@ ination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities attached to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capitals in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant up in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that last week the government proclaimed a demonstration of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ ici@@ a region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occ@@ ured in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
the whole of Portugal is burning in the true sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire prevention measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ eign@@ ty of the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
according to Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads closed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy as in June , as the streets were locked very late . &quot;
in addition , building permits are questioned in places of high fire risk .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the form of rolling that the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was challenged by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed construction activity to fall if the applicant compla@@ ined about means of self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val further explains in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us drew attention to the fact that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of easily inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread after fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of the civil defence of Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October , when inhabitants were seeking information , or trying to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so crucial in October that the servers were not able to resist the assault of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .

in a night in autumn 1994 , the Taliban &apos;s conquest of Afghanistan began .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups broke out , defe@@ ating the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , spent the last time with his family at dinner in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say so at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - maybe even more .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many of Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Taliban , known for their hatred for the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af was found again in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wage , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar that were heavier than he himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood .
back then , as today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site we worked on .
there was no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we don &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af made his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece .
after the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome alone , fell asleep in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high ratings . however , it is also true that the conditions of asylum seekers in the country are disa@@ strous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can go for months after the application of the asylum application .
until then , people who do not have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined wild life helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions .
having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af caught his entire savings in establishing a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick bite .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ an firms have sprung up , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ du@@ a the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also are Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s targets extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and target back to the country , which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forgot my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conversion techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey by himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey .
citizen report : bill dra@@ fts for Egypt permit shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported on the ev@@ ac@@ uation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo that prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .
pictures of @ C@@ il@@ un@@ a@@ 27 shared on Twitter .
global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen @-@ Report is an international snapshot that highlights challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after regi@@ stering with a government agency .
users would have to register to use the social networks within six months of the legal decision on the website of the authority , stating their full name and their ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the payment of a penalty .
the law , which was applied by sixty parliamentary members , is at present the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another MP delivered a legislative proposal introducing tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the President or a senior official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the law proposed , however , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , so legal experts from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tahrir Initiative for Middle East Policy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the law be approved , it can mean up to three years &quot; imprisonment for the convic@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly freedom has been in danger already for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took pictures of the demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inaugur@@ ation of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
according to Sha@@ w@@ kan , more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident four years in prison on a court appointment .
it was recently postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison administration failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om , according to the human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , pseudo @-@ loading of , among others , weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza confirmed the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si session block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists to interro@@ gate documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated on a le@@ aked plan of action . the President of the Republic , according to the plan , was expressly supported by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , would explicitly declare a controversial draft law to the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused of am@@ nesty , provided that they return all un@@ lawful received funds .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April raises a light on how presidential plans to support the legislation look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected his sources mentioning the article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Committee , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
does China want to force the users of social media to submit their ID ?
according to new rules of the Government Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China need permission before writing or sharing messages in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments into social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; can we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of information distribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Land government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government lists a list of online services that &quot; organize the publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to charge up @-@ to @-@ date services for removing content and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites are currently owned by websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ isse@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
Turkish court ordered the ban Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , the indications that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications reported that the site was blocked because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to address a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked its website . it is thus , among others , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop puff@@ ing up
after this week of le@@ aked documents , Britain &apos;s government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time and to install Backdoor programs that de@@ code data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal , but has abandoned other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
