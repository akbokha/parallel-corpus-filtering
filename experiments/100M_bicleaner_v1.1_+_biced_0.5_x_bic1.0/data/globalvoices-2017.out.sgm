<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter, who with the help of Julia Roberts revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "according to Method One," "" "I was as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only increased my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how to deal with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague expressed it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with the Republican primaries was the highest number of nominees nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans supporting this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was not able to reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, who receives people from all over the world, a deeply believer man with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "dumps Weltanschauung also agreed with the current editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix Suns game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "intolerance" "" "also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who is fighting the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Lecturkey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied through them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made his way to nominee Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, presided over a man, in spite of - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their congregations are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, it is hardly possible to forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (note.): as much as "white against all other ethnicities," pun on white and whiplash, which means so much like whiplash injuries), as the great Van Jones called, has killed exactly what America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have always, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of an Kenyan, whose history, as he says himself, would nowhere else be possible anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trump, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they shouted and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan finished with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for whom his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trump country, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca province with the kids of the Paraguaan city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 odometer south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de Música (music banger) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with its musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its abuse of drugs and bandit violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and sing with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located at the top of the biggest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays capital - play instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers started turning into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as the music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra and so on.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult, because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about 1 billion tons of garbage each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can effectively combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a lawbreaker of this kind along its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilised against the ship. they refused to dock one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything," "" "says Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fisheries administration. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million to Liberia for plundering the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was founded FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (stop illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, which is extremely difficult to trace. therefore, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, can harm the illegal fishing of ecosystems which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once impeded by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail's pace with which information was circulating between individual countries, actions are happening in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange, for example, lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also very carefully tracks the activities of ships when they move on the open sea using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships fishing in prohibited areas - such as those who suggest that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such examinations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license, where they were on the road and possibly if they have a criminal complaint.</seg>
<seg id="116">On the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay the numbers of punishments, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "this is about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means illegal fishing is not worth financially anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting company committed to fighting illegal fishing in Africa and supporting FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The so-called platform was created to regain estimated $20 million lost in turnover lost by eight members of the HISH-i network each year for illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, fake licences, specifying fantasies, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international co-operation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-complete control system," "" "says Long." "" "earlier, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You are not running my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far, the closed front functions.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed forged licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and found and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that aims to help FISH-i locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO, who also deals with fishery data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">For example, some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be located by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that combines different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i find ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protoving Organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data to display the position of each vessel in the world.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "get together with neighbors to get a better picture of who's doing what is happening - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and consolidate their resources into the investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global scale." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project that allows a global system to prosecute ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detract criminals, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were previously unlicensed and hardly expected to have consequences know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i meanwhile have a 33% increase in fishing sales since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets where they were banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars are lost annually by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined forces, the West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i. "Safety is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia has been able to report its first major triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and used towing nets, which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong signal that they go against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">Road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the Presidency of Nicolás Maduro's mandate.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the removal of the referendum, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by gathering in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the regression of Venezuela) both of these demonstrations and arguments can be found against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Barinas lowland region, in the Andean regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the central north-north federal state of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation is steadily deteriorating, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the removal of the current president Nicolás Maduro the chance for a fundamental change, but in the end the secrecy of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence rate is among the highest in the whole world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial end), and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country a chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (about: round Table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is time for Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide Civil Strike and on November 3 all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, pictures that tell of arguments are piled up, as well as reports of oppression and maltreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially big waves smote the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">The demonstrators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statements against the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could leave the cathedral again, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andean state of Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts because otherwise one could see something that many national gardists do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic is already making the rounds, which depict the extent of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">In this way, the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many of the government's representatives had challenged the validity of the call for a referendum procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="189">Others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which, from their point of view, has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and would rather be engaged in clogging critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches increase more and more in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 in Día a Día, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities of La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now said in the context of the great La Perla Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, investigates crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept family secrets for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that was ok.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years you don't realize that you are being manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerie. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Directed by Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quianos son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child has chosen for himself a path of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>

<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1-20 September to electronic adverts in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun newspaper, which appears in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>

<seg id="356">"" "the incorrect English translation was removed first. the designation" "" "terrible drivers" "" "(German:" "" "terrible motorists" "" ") was later replaced by the more appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct term" elder drivers "(German:" older drivers ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Prefecture excused for translation errors. furthermore, it declared that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the following about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are really sorry that older people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">"" "the Japanese online news service J-Cast News spoke a little more extensively with the phenomenon of" "" "terrible" "" "older drivers in Japan and wrote:" ""</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "has been denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents in the country is quite a reason for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the prefecture of Kyoto, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, two important skills are needed: passive knowledge of the language to understand the source text and active language skills in order to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers who want to learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees can make translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is best rated as the best, is made to a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confusing and enigmatic movements that arise by machine translations show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest British formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may still be acceptable or at least harmless, but by large corporations or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto is hopefully making use of a more serious source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">"" "main page of the portal" "" "Navision con Libertad" "" "(Free Surfing) of the IPY (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society)." ""</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to Vivoplay online.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presence of VPITV and El Capitolio TV is no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups that oppose the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the association was caught and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to gain access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are again closed.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially during periods of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant in reporting about protests since 2014. back then, the Commission on Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw it as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national television channels, I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is surprising that it is still cheaper to buy two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly delegates its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier investigations carried out by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique whereby the DNS servers will answer requests for certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds faulty or refuses to request the request when visiting such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNA lock: @ ellaoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast on Thursday, April 6th, was suspended when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried out the protests in Caracas, was put into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten as he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went back on stream.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections, making it more difficult for the Venezuelans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the abbreviated version of a report written by Global Voices, courtesy of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools"), edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before she graduated from university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she's like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one from which has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she started working as a Criadita for the family. as a criadita, Paraguay has more than 46,000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is very simple: a large family with little money transfers their minors son or their underage daughter to another more richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over his head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to spend innumerable days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, AlvarEnga worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas, especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected witness testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated by the criadita generally guarantees silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"" "" "" "the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," "" "says Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, it is the family that finds its daughter in the belief that she will complete her training, improve her position in society and "make something out" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that takes up the girl and justifies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that otherwise would not be educated and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will experience it until many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon occurred, which takes place in the hidden in paraguayan households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military family Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their home in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira defeated Marín as long as she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were responsible for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they described the Criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," complained Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to unpunished children's rights.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be directional - if for the first time in the Paraguays story a case of criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The Everyday of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the caribbean, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Her brothers now had to work all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to the school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In her employer's house, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she was still time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>

<seg id="469">At some evenings, the master of the house Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>

<seg id="474">But it was perfectly clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months of the adoption of the law, users would have to register with their real names and ID numbers on the site with their right names and ID numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months "imprisonment or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, composed of six paragraphs and cursed in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration. it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still rebuilding the region.</seg>

<seg id="544">Documented in early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for the northeast of Japan, has documented the progress that has been achieved over the past six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a tremendous earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture has been a peaceful prefectures in Japan's northeast, experiencing both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had left whole coastal towns off the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">For this purpose, Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, and alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, which progress has been achieved six years after, in order to rebuild the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement buildings (...) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, six years after the catastrophe, it is still possible to relocate evacuated homes to the final replacement buildings, evacuated by means of accommodation (...).</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people living in Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 per cent of the evacuees from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who were hauled after the disaster in shelters, were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three concerned prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung was able to determine, 1074 of 1,100 schools affected by disaster have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land, have grown extensively.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land have been destroyed by Fukushima in the "nuclear barrier area."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent of the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal residents have felt it more difficult to earn a living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. she asked her about the status of rebuilding and how her receiving had changed in relation to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo paper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey in order to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of the local residents took action to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents found that still not enough was done in terms of disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to evacuate from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung has increased its attention to the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, disaster-induced, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 thousand people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled into permanent replacement buildings.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the state of 2017 there are still 40,000 inhabitants living in Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuees are older than 50 years old. they are well known because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries that speak a different language, the differences appear to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that one more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that ultimately the world is very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">As a result of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast, we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Crikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love of music has strengthened their affection for the Iranian culture; Adriana Macias talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="625">The Uncharted Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all Cuba closed the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayagque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - no matter where there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After lying down the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and plunged daily into the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, rising every day at 4: 00 o'clock in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive period because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene is very fond of having heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the municipality has already seen better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nonetheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the export of raw sugar would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will surely go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban president Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then onwards, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the breakdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, is the word he repeated the most" "" "scam" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially authored documents that differed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All of them were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister was able to approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was postponed and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories still operating in operation," he affirms.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He participated in the shutdown of the factory which he helped to build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">Cuba's most developed industrial area and the most important workload generator has been extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the facilities in the communities in which they were located were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammut's speech of October 21, 2002, the then president saw in the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would go well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or rather, when they began to discourage them, they also stopped to aspire to the road, which also disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to pick up other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were sentenced to replacement parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a future perspective, many young people suddenly forsook the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">A food factory has been created in the area, production is not even used for the supply of the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began working.</seg>

<seg id="683">Mr. Nene, a man of black skin color, small, with few teeth and clear voice, is not a supporting person, but he does not forgive the lies that one told him.</seg>
<seg id="684">They have tormented him for ten years.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo uses with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with themes that are important to them. they do this by hip-hop, thanks to a number of traveling workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by Pedagogen David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop invites participants to find topics like "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes into meaning.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a section of road in West Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of preserving traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whenmagoosti Cree First Nation recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstar hip-hop group, which gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available, as well a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one ever cares for me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as a youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will raise ourselves one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and also go ahead with our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended the creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary section, the reader and advocate of the Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse in syllable (which is also published on his blog and published here with approval):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (real-time), "sculptural models of dishes") are exhibited by every dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tobooter district of Kappabashi there are a large number of small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are usually that they don't even notice them. however, a new trend is turning it into showy cell accessories and gadgets nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist to the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new plastic dishes decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitsch collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin's fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in Essentials is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple peeling your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the cell phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura and nitsrogen is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and palms of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can watch other whimsical plastic dishes at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow Twitter on hashtag #...</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and ghosts regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reports of drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the congregations who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "aperia Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "live with drug trafficking"), which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories about people who came into the fight between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describing the project this way:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime lets us not only be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video entitled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how fear life changes" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father, who searches secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on just one day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "as every Sunday, we prepare ourselves today for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for the tombs, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we need not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of journalists and journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of animal político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Her contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensing journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I come by newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent to this or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug trafficker) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something is happening to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "people's inaction is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village can be justified by" "" "being rebellious" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they don't stir and are still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the main district district: how a family was plundered with threats." it describes how armed criminals took money from their business for month for month, until they had destroyed not only the business, but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you've lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are away from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when to kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega has published the article entitled" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation drawn by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, fry potato, warm tortillas and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years earlier, when he removed only a few blocks from his home, who saw the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as a force mastered by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the citizens "council for public safety and government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office amounted to 3103 murders. this corresponds to average average of 8.5 Mordes per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "aperia Vivir Con El Narco," animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, which aims to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact-check is important in a moment when it comes to raising rumors or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how about the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or false, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "wrong description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting about events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images of news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the east of DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of sleep holes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to that of the tanker.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials describe a fireball which enveloped dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby, which was full of people watching the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerated.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the dreadful scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies lined up on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was taken up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses had dramatically reported atrocities to which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one left to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images could the follow-up time be displayed metaphorically.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unresolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt by Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from DR Congo appeared again, as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">Indeed, this misuse of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One more step further personal comments such as this example falsely relate the image from DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash announcement, published by the United Nations, those who were able to escape could beatings, rape and several deaths, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following, who brought together these descriptions with photos from DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news page, falsely claiming that Myanmar's president Thein has said that monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image of DR Congo to photograph this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was last accessed on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations, who called AFP as their source, also wrongly attributed Thein to this statement, but did not have the image associated with the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Global Range of False Information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false coupling dates back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using an inverted image search, you can see how far information can cross borders.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted image search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures under 18.8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to the predicted image from DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mix of private sites, social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have forwarded fake reports, some others have tried to expose the falsifications.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have borrowed examples of improper use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which page they were published. by doing so, we want to present the range more clearly than by language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">Several examples of abusive use may come from the countries listed below (which in some cases have also been linked to each other).</seg>
<seg id="867">Here are some cases that can now be fully felt (on the card in orange):</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page falsely claimed that the president of Myanmar Thein had admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in killing Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the Katholische neighboured news page Análisis Digital, has explicitly stated that the image does not come from the killings, but it claims that there is a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>

<seg id="915">The image of DR Congo emerged, provided with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted their communities to pay greater attention to those events that were presumed to take place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times saved), but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong subjects or frames (frameworks) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is assessed compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">But a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are dozens of people with social media who unwittingly share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Is this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and that the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent images has already been discussed in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the retention of images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, there is a concern that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers and taking them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media work on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be replaced by the context or completely abusive kind.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take account of how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. opplacable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in each language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these invaluable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese sausage) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist a stubborn attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or phrase is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is required in order to understand precisely what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a long time in an online-list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">The blog contains, for example, words from the vogue language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- sample your parents in recognition of how they have been trying to keep you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that one feels after being warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They mitigate other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this side want to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which usually fights at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilaga and Attanagalu Oya have gone over the shores in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">Following an opinion from Sri Lanka's disaster centre on May 28, 2017, 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missed due to the flood and mud wave.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and around 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe locations.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfall started on Saturday (27th May), and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos provide an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">High water in Tawalama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users such as Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates to flood situations.</seg>

<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are being completed for transportation of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Different organisations and startups have also agreed to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages like Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid.</seg>

<seg id="988">The Taxiruf app PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster centre is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Roanu, Pickme introduced a "flood relief" button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations. they were then forwarded to the Sri Lankan Red Cross for free.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also launched an "SOS" key, which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floods and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="991">The combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka, where several social media platforms are fully exploited, provide security and help to residents in need.</seg>

<seg id="1004">You have to dism me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look alike.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim in a variety of ways. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, who like me do not fit into it, are being demoted.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be disposed of</seg>
<seg id="1011">I don't stand alone with it alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This has even happened to the poet, whose poetry is best sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1015">Peace? peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran, and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry by the day he died.</seg>

<seg id="1019">This deleting constitutes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another consists in the reductionist images of Muslims who have been colonizing western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This tempting imagery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1022">The pioneering Palestinian-American scientist Edward Said dragged the story behind these images in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1023">But these pictures stand out today.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continue to discard it.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful, faulty narratives dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadows the reality that in the past three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries, while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative will fail to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and forcing Saudi-Arab, Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body, both of which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">"" "a powerful group is exercising its" "" "control" "" "on the" "" "other" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong narrative weakens Muslim women, leading movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Africans who were brought here with slave ships.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has filled our collective imagination such deep and faulty that Sikh-men and children often become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and chicings.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1034">About 1.7 billion people</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry, we do more than telling stories based on facts.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Storytelling, by flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way of communicating with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported on a different initiative by Steven Bird, the unsettable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of language of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project apply:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that assume diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to it is often associated with understanding" "" "these events" "" "instead" "" "use the listening to appreciate, to make sense." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers present their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience insists on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional tale from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art that are typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamara tells the story of the hare and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his fabel, John Nyamara is asked:" "" "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a wide grin, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You listened to it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand it. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of revising the public debt of Puerto Rico, which rose to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017. the march started at the Puertorian Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (citizen's front for the neural examination of debts) and the Ekomenical Church Convention Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of fixing the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debt are being held accountable for their corruption.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, there was an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: collective Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available here royalty-free, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have no information since then about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, and instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process from time-to-day extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and attorney Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police had taken Bassel as a "top secret" command of the military tribunal from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that they were contacted by people who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his whereabouts and conditions remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a key role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the head of the head of New Palmyra, a project that Bassel founded, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes was more predictive than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilisations and here, Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influence.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do all this, to wipe out this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught others to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a proclamation that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was detained.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together for a year in the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against Bashar al-Assad's regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under regime from the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in jail since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we reiterate our call for the hope we have to do for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: director of corruption, convicted of corruption, resigned on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was perpetrated.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Diodino Cambaza who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants due to embezzlement of 54 million Metikal (around 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice Cambaza ruled between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for its re-adjustment to the company, which took place on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the request, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to take back its old post, as the company did not carry out any disciplinary proceedings after its detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not call the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP) condemned the company's decision to put the director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the counter trading.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The firm was apparently silent however and caused no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, an important voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as "disgusting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had expired.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company that he can inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza is fond of paying for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">It is disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director does not have any morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insults him, I can't believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the morals to return and serve the state, * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served himself in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to Samora Machel prison which will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, one-edged and - by the way - prophetic orators.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral depictions was that "an ambitious man was capable of all, even the fatherland for his ambitions to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he was 10 years old and released.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of Eastern Indian origin, or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censuses the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "in Burmese lettering" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism this day, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burmical words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written in Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting bse), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hurt is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it solves all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you are writing on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What you should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech are a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to cut off nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of catchwords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he wanted to inform his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook policy, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to hide, post and share content for 24 hours because the post "did not meet the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring even more hatred within the various denominations.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and prohibited words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "hereditary curry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little bit more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has provided users with a lot of ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech, but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with homologation.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian movie." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post states:" "" "if you are a doctor, then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have applied social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should also incite violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in the territory Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to take control of the balancing hate speech on his Burmese sites.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better current to look at context rather than relying on code-focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements seeking to abolish child marriage laws followed at the bottom and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">But not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about saying to the critics of the child, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This sort of religious opposition caused tensions in this rather uncomplicated thing, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the draft bill altogether.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the child marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country has to agree and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country posted a status update on Facebook, which once again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambresat: the bill against the child marriage was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft may now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws of the child's marriage had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a minister in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">There has been too much time and unnecessary talk that has concealed the core of the matter, but do you know what? the child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to complete the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, stating:,, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">"" "" "" "the Act has been approved." ""</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for that - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Torture Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WIND), a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage-able age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The amendment to the amendment to the Act was adopted today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All deputies agreed to have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is no longer permitted by law.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long struggle (...) # childbirth abuse.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who fought it.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Happy Birthday.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a potential catch comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the country's most famous Hindu organisation.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj proclaimed his intention to take legal action, the law was to be adopted, and he now seems to deliver on his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users desired that the debate would approach the issue differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we think instead of discussing so broadly, instead of talking about the problem that we, instead of talking about the problem, would simply say that the state that protects our daughters from being abused by large, hard-boiled men who are in advantage of them, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or still the norm in different gradations, even though there are laws which they prohibit.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Hackers controlled the office of the national prosecutor in front of national protests on the Russian national holiday</seg>
<seg id="1383">Screen printing of the message posted on Sunday early on the Public Prosecutor's website of Yaroslavl District.</seg>
<seg id="1384">On the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coincided with the Day of Russia - the Russian national holiday - the website of the prosecutor was hacked by Yaroslavl District. hackers left a funny message "Staying home.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring websites, Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia-page was presented on January 18, 2012, contradictory to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright law in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Compiled by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing platform based on crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockade.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy internet users are used to use strapping tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia, as reported recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">Turkey is the second most famous country in the world after China, when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to lock, several mirror sites (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and often update) are now dipped up.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia articles on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (calculator calculator connections), which is not based on the domain name system, making it difficult to complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">In spite of the legal ban, the content is still available.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we've heard the news (about the block of Wikipedia), we set everything down to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed fashion.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users view at least all Wikipedia contents even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia participated in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonny of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedia, a mirror site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiLeror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar lunatics sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni told Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member, as well as collaborators at Mozilla im Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motives and well-balanced colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepalese wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown directly next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw the attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation in his work helps him:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly called me Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida castle). he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river-damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started grinding pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he stood face to face to Tigers face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the King of Buhark appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with great care avoid saying the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that because of the social pressure they respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of a fake court from the Indian State of Odisha and expelled from her family and the village community after she spoke to a married family.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also is common among men. however, they have far fewer assignements to fear, if at all they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, joined a unique club and thus became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # Khelmir, which is operated by the Video Volunteers community and advocates the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paz has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS-infected people, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her panel discussion was women who did not name her husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the discussion about the Patriarchate with a problem that women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To speak loudly the name of her husbands is a custom, which they all solemnly uphold and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini points out:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition attests that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is considered a deceitful woman, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about it until this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try at home, as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem at Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women never have the name of their husbands to pronounce.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only disguised herself during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole exerted frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In an adrenaline rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try home to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation dealt with violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the cinder red point on the forehead, indicating the status of the married couple:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would wear the zin-red dot if he did it too." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped carrying him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely with it, but they think they are now in a better position to choose themselves not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example, how our identities are tied to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things aloud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only bore saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it's okay, but some wanted to wear a salad-curta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of arguments and discussions about the advantages of their own dress code, morality connected with the Saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question as to whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have done little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, make it, but only when they are alone and are not other members of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it's not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1546">The first visit to Japan of the popular band The Beatles is celebrated with a commemorative day</seg>
<seg id="1547">The Beatles at their landing in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1548">Screenshot from the official YouTube channel of the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On June 29th of this year the hashtag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit to the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a reversal in the Japanese culture of the post-war era.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in 1964 in London, noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just about five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here have become clear quickly that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">"" "the cult band's music is" "" "more than just a universal language like English," "" "said Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review." ""</seg>
<seg id="1556">"" "good morning!" "" "today is the Beatles memorial day in Japan." "" "for the first time, 51 years ago, they were here in Tokyo." ""</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese central schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Beatles kitsch survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "I don't know if this" "" "Winnie the Pooh" "" "doll is supposed to represent John Lennon or not." ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it belongs to fans, of course, Japanese also make pilgrimages to the familiar locations connected with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (New York memorial)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">Pilgrimages can sometimes not be quirky enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year as well.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also use the fanbase in terms of market technology, such as this Ramen-Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">Today I will listen to Yesterday and eat Ramen noodles at Mutaro Koya.</seg>
<seg id="1579">This is how the day is going to run today.</seg>
<seg id="1580">So, we hope you are there!</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trafficking, probably for disbelieving purposes, is concerned by the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government has now called for a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of shamans were used in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There are local superstitions that the head of a bald man could bring gold or bring wealth, declared the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led the UN to conduct a mission in the South African country in 2016 in order to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government has developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange where the killings took place.</seg>

<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for supposedly disbelieving rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the blogger's poor Snaippa on Facebook, suggesting that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique confronts:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÖCHTE GERNE ONE Mozambique, THAT I am ashamed of a country in which the people would have shame to go on the street, as if they would be ashamed to offer sex against good marks, and even take their lives to earn their bread, a country where neither the Albinos nor the bald or bald, for disbelieving purposes or "black magic," aimed to attain fast wealth.</seg>

<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years "imprisonment for" Subversion "(endangerment) after having participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto that demanded democratic reforms in China.</seg>

<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed in December of last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>

<seg id="1673">The Council of the Agrarian Affairs in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Liu and show greater tolerance toward those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>

<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished, led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state on an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that we are not a country in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in the face of what appeared to be inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre appears again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system, really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarned the corresponding questions with non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls upon Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country is our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clear up this point if it was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">As Anon published his commentary on the blog, he points out concerning reviews that one should start reading the entire script of the conference so that one can understand the context of the statements made by Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore to cities in the US (and how many of these cities saw for decades a party win?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that really, and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "has Mr. Shanmugam" "" "good faith a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>

<seg id="1768">First: to be referred to as "nice" means to be diligent - like the benevolent, gentle but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian double-loner).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada was really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">To be harmless is to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good, if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major property of the Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the road to migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and golden earrings in a teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on their way through.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom, there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but there are still hundreds of African and Haitian migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, tells Mrs Ramírez, people come to full minibuses and from the top of the coast they start calling: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already been sleeping outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings her to the hospital if they are sick, she buys drugs that she cannot pay, she massaging them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answered with a smile." "" "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard about other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the circuit," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and the Africans are often travelling together and that Africans are already speaking at Whatsapp by Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup Football Championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months now: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her going again," "" "he answered smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family welcomed migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African immigrants too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he fled from people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to extort money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, travellers should consult their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs Ramírez seems happy that her house is full but she is nostalgic because of those who left.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she leaves in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with african hair lichens, which you made a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which they called the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities also tried to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the police message it was clear that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "damaging information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangen's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with minors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"" "for example, the" "" "remote control" "" "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages on digital censorship in China mainly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in distant, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures, as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China" (which is based on Twitter), which has published censored messages in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen choosed the residents to decide if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiano make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (see Securities Central) also published a Jingwang product description, which indicates that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system, thus providing unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the City Council's instructions to minimize dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All branches of government, government and affiliated organizations, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the orders of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi by order to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" to be registered by the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for quite a number of other possible offenses, including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I am used to not responding.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can no longer say exactly when insults and strikes have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished if I didn't do anything to make this penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2064">At punishment in all their diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>

<seg id="2069">Give it the pleasure, you can't measure yourself with it and you can't hold back your screams.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams didn't like him yet, which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first arrest, I asked myself if the investigator used to work as a garbage collector or if it belonged to normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables to show us the, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them alternated while I was still in the series.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I listened to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noticed the cooling and didn't really enjoy it, which is why he attacked the electric bar next to it.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity enjoyed my whole body, enough to supply my whole district.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-naked body stretched out on the floor was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">That must have been around midnight.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emballam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emballam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emballam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he locks himself to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine-spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaib's family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as felayees (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate active activist opposed by the conservative majority and questioned their established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his home town Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not constrained in his thinking, and he can feel according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special reluctance against US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who attempt to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugee from the second generation" - he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I'm a man," while in water soldered Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during that time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the lukewarm coffee and the cheeks of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"" "" "" "sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you look into neighbouring countries." ""</seg>
<seg id="2109">This is why it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan - to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan said a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the legitimate legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to choose "intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not simply be shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib moved traditional sex organs to Leibe by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently unidentified unknown woman, whose arms and legs reach up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the innumerable women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years the number of 'honour killings' has increased in Jordan, leaving the unofficial outwardly.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honors in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 international law on crime, women who are exposed to the threat of domestic violence can "be held in prison indefinitely," and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs's music is also very popular and is well-known for not shy away from themes that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was fed up with politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "" "Hdaib attacks the question of the Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are in essence political can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled "Santander."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated strikingly often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can "get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and lesbians' rights and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to find out later that his comments were ripped out of the context, distorted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a processed version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not disagree with Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nudie, a poet of the 8th century, still remembered today thanks to his homophobic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nudie, who was supposed to work once on behalf of the caliphs, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanier not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service established several former members of the Association of Teachers and members of the Association of Teachers, arguing that they had critical comments in social media about the problems related to the corruption entrenched in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - that's what Hdaib looks like - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also about "experiencing them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will come closer to a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial kinds of democracies.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue and resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated also in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the festive carriages, the drums and dancing were handed down over more than a thousand years and came from a time when armies from the west of Japan marched into the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time now: two fixed carriages are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # Nebutafestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of an 18-meter high-end car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, outward appearance and personal care were as important as in this story because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate job like the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the Pacific coast, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more normal citizens to move into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can reproduce these intricate hair styles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos" competition, which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts face each other in order to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hairdressing tools and to receive training in the hairdresser's art, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported some of their achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only secondary school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to offer affection to people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga of the Foundation Bogotá and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la reconciliación (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (Colombia's Revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The sign of the peace treaty was so important that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of genuine reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, have been exposed to war rhetoric, and around the clock their weapons have been borne, must now re-integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians could join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's day, but those who need them much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He continued to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected within the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March at one of the UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo, travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the politician student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a representative of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to enter, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Pomegranate, a lethal weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "he answered," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I reply to a letter someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "" "suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of war, was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there's a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have learned only how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices - new voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start of the event, students and some leader of the FARC have come together for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC had already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the Organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State looked upon the whole of Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles" "", "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard their hearing yet and had no right to vote, and to recognize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings turned upside down by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have been killed and done so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of Cali, Archbishop of Cali.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was informed that peace would reign after the disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to resort to arms, to stand up and protest for their rights. and that is fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexuals and queer people living in the Caucasus region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - discrimination, physical and sexual violence and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="2244">In horror, activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs over the LGBTQ community there has not been created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines several months ago after reports have been published that deal with the dragging, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Novaya Gazeta, throwing a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a translady, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">She felt that she was a woman in fact since her childhood.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had experienced the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">She moved out of fear for her life in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer assistant in a human rights organisation.</seg>

<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a translady who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone I thought would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya that can remove this disgrace?"</seg>

<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got it all along and started crying.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: what records were you put in - in those of the men or those of the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, my male name is still on it; but the doctor knew and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I received threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some told me that I must prove it by going up without the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grozny and say that I had not changed my gender, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what could I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You brought a monster to the world that has shamed not only your family but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">To my mother it became too much and she put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later a car with a dark window panes and a number plate with a 95 on it stood under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registration, without ID, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you're safe, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, it's a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to look like the person she recalls from her past - that is, my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For that, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who settled in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of the Ramadan, and he did not lock out a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With that I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require proof that the so-called "honor" experienced through blood gratification.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relative or who were dropped by their relatives in order to face Kadyrows judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can present them as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically immersed in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports about it yet. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else wouldn't it have allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've been wearing my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known throughout Grosny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In serious cases!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" "" "Civilization" "", "but finally dropped us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never crooked a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spread not on the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say it to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed that they were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never chased and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who laughed and laughed before, gazed at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic deteriorated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you follow now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Aside from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreffs, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">"" "" "" "I don't spend a cent on it for a long time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I parked the type of influenza.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth, that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestanes who have the cabarins who, the Russians, have what; on the whole planet they exist - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men here from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during the Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about transient to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of experiencing to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to become so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a sharp increase in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi, on August 27, aroused the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to cope with his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who wish to work in Ahwaz and want to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Talegastral Hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the incinerations were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shaab Bani Tamim - have hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families due to the persecution on the part of the Iranian government and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab-Arab community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 saw great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields emerging in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population only gets little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often a victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime has systematically refused the Ahwazi Arabs to work in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of tribes, the waters from the Arab areas to the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are diverting.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to devastation caused by drought in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "" "" "the unemployment rate among the Arab ahawzi people now rose to 81%." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of co-operation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist living in London told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"" "" "" "since functionaries and institutions do not preference to recruit Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to make a living outside their home country of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must endure, human rights activists strike an alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and knowing it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still earn less money today despite equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women stumble at a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on gender still continues across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am suffering double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to speak on the skin colour, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and" Kumbaya, my lord, "in order to reach the equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualized violence there is an institutionalised form of racial, motivating violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migrant background are often referred to school as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin colour to have the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind, referring to both sex and skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging to a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical respect a distorted and marginalised being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural enrichment to promote their egocentric programme." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the overlap of skin color and gender. some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins to a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" still lies in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which has been called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than advocating for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">And not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call for separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a woman as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life has neither bypassed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2469">Again and again Nabil Musa travelled to Iraq in the last 7 years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a special concern throughout the Kurdistan Region in Iraq. his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa explaining his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"" "" "" "I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child," "" "Musa says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, the pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had been violent to her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena for abuse, the official announcement of Ada Báez was also of no use.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman withdrew her complaint.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women make a complaint at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to being victims of violence are in general report to law enforcement agencies.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really maltreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institute in Paraguay. "there are different statements and reports, which do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Attorney General's Office had 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of policemen came from the police.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. here, too, 86% of the advertisements were made by women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women talked about psychic mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan woman minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "every woman in Paraguay is refunded because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "she said at the end of 2014 on every woman who has been awarded for physical abuse," "" "she announced at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay is not a separate crime, the law enforcement authorities cannot appropriately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to its estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she gave up.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos. but for two years she endured the mental force - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their posts, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had enjoyed this so long ago from Carlos and did not leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay in order to prove that their former partner abused them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women, all of whom are victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk with others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case, everything began with psychic mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias advertisements for the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a process against her former partner who developed into an impenetrable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft law was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, known as the hashtag # Porellas (# forge).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-EineWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees that it is the case that Femizidis should become a perpetual criminal offence and to punish the harsher as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the text of the law was changed in some points to also win the deputies for the law that feared that the path for decriminalisation of abortion would be levelled, which is generally forbidden in Paraguay and punishable by up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">"" "" "" "the original draft law foresaw most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence currently have to bear, if they simply want to refund and receive a secure accommodation, to impose the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking must take place, so that violence no longer be regarded as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent in the face of these facts, complicates himself and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are kidnapped.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we have to report such a long ad until mistreatment is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been changed, including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>

<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after completing his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, he has held the main offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultans rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular the intelligence service, the public freedoms, including freedom of press, to limit and torture human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict and block peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, image by agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and the lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping establish their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Sámi Healthcare System.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misconceptions of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sámi national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think of the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain recipient instead of being a mover himself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, health care (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa vs. Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that are challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazine articles only make available against payment (the so-called" "" "Paywall" "" "), also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been in the USA salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 sorts, such as Outredgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was only limited by its own ingenuity and the question of how many lettuce types it can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents tend not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crooked leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered to more and more plants such as grain or cartons. as a result of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate exponent of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but in the meantime he needs longer because his work is more and more complicated by more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I have to drank." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go too far on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, no one can breed a new type of lettuce, because all of the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries not to use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and anywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"" "astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salt at the Outredgeous variety in the" "" "glasshouse" "" "of the station and tested whether plants can be grown in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (open source seed initiative) is inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can undertake to freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders allow others to cross their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not to sow immediately - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">A gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi member of the Board of Directors, Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds also play a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds," he says. "those who want to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetables is grown is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to freely make their seeds available to others. in contrast, their approach is in contrast to patented seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Foto de Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool shrinks unceasingly due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights available on plant material, which is thus always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about a third of all carrot features are protected as intellectual property, making it impossible for plant breeders to be used either at all or even more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are still no such estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that large-scale cultivated plants such as wheat are still patented as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those by which their taste or colour improves right up to those, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before, as the changed conditions are much more difficult to predict due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the view that intellectual property invests other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varieties innovate." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by making more material and know-how available to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it different: wait 20 years until a patent is running, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed to plants adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, Morton's main argument is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to facilitate farmers their work." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">Overall, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features: "we don't really create the features ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants they form themselves and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret to nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi executive board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever breeds a variety breeds also its own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whom mass herbicides are needed, breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto are) patents, most smaller seed companies manage to survive without patents - either they reject patenting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In addition, Morton believes that breeders would benefit from the elimination of plant patents: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties on their own in a few years, "he says." for 20 years, it is protected from competition with a patent, which makes it quite simple to me. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the USA seems to be leading in the "open source" breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a "open source" seed program.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol is working on an open-source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding vary from country to country, which is why Ossi's obligation cannot simply be adopted one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patents of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for open source seed systems, states that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems for which the official launch will be launched next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A consortium of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration) has put together a database for seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above them.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the Network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities have sharply criticized for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Leave in spite of this attack and the spotting of the Egyptian law and the constitution to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, to uncover in this part of the world and to give victims a vote.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 web sites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of Huffington Post and Al Jazeera's Qatar network for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of seismic barriers to victims. @ anhri one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpd.5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to the ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he writes for sites and media that are not accessible to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he directed to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which also Ziadas blog is given a home, on the other hand is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the locking by the government and reflected what it means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blog to ban is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and although the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, an attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words: my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. these resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of providers that were possible to circumvent Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed against these actions in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian Army is deployed in the Favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school" "", "" "" "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro" "", "" "" "Thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air-afee to Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for ten years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable and # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the editorial" "" "Extra" "" "known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 published the editorial" "" "It is not normal" "" "in which it announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper said the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">We will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that happens in the civilised standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: it is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, explained that this decision is not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper around the world with a martial law in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper continues writing:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argues that violence as a "war" is arguing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historic and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">According to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro is wrong: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to the statistics of 2015 in the north and north-east of the country. these are the most up-to-date available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the Mordrates per state, Rio is ranked 16th," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">The company Globo, the largest media company in South America, is one of the largest media companies in South America, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the security policy of the state for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to capture a favela by using a massive police force and to permanently stationed a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this led to a decline of violent death cases. however, after several years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also involves serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war. this includes entering into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week it is now time for the police to climb up the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Amid all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly through the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the Research Institute, The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Eastern Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition, based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations, assume that the massacre was committed by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus, leading to the fact that villagers are locally made or transported through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockade, traditional food like meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghouta how they can plant their own fungi as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnida and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the traditional food in Syria, and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, Abo Nabil, said AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">"" "Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that for three years has been fighting to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now more and more" "" "becoming known." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alhuda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the planting of mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila at Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations from CanDo until Monday, 4 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began the" "" "production of fungal seeds originating from the regions" "" "before proving their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tank. when this was done, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mould throughout Eastern Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many district capitals in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant up in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that last week the government proclaimed a demonstration of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>
<seg id="2840">The whole of Portugal is burning in the true sense of the word # PrayForPortugal - nata (@ a _ ataner) October 15th, 2017</seg>

<seg id="2845">The aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire prevention measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was unable to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Sovereignty of the Federation of Farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">According to Pedrógão, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads closed by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria there would have been a similar tragedy as in June, as the streets were locked very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits are questioned in places of high fire risk.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the form of rolling that the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was challenged by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"" "" "" "the government introduced a loosening of the law which allowed construction activity to fall if the applicant complained about means of self-defence - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built" "", "João Sorval further explains in the same article of the newspaper Público." ""</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus drew attention to the fact that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of easily inflammable wood, like in a vicious circle, continue to spread after fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the civil defence of Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October, when inhabitants were seeking information, or trying to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it used the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in October that the servers were not able to resist the assault of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war between the various Mujahedin groups broke out, defeating the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair.</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf was found again in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wage, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar that were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, Afghan refugees in Iran were marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site we worked on.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we don't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf made his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome alone, fell asleep in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high ratings. however, it is also true that the conditions of asylum seekers in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "" "with improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can go for months after the application of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who do not have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained wild life helped Asharaf to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">Having worked for several years in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf caught his entire savings in establishing a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick bite.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In 2017, the film received the Venice City Award, which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghan firms have sprung up, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the Restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome also are Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashark's targets extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and target back to the country, which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are opportunities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forgot my country and I can't live happily if I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also forges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conversion techniques." "" "so they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey by himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this journey.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Citizen report: bill drafts for Egypt permit shutdown of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the evacuation of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo that protested against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Pictures of @ Ciluna27 shared on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen-Report is an international snapshot that highlights challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that shows that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use the social networks within six months of the legal decision on the website of the authority, stating their full name and their ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the payment of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty parliamentary members, is at present the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May, another MP delivered a legislative proposal introducing tougher penalties for the insult of the President or a senior official." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">"" "" "" "under the law proposed, however, such action would be punished with prison and fines, so legal experts from the" "" "Tahrir Initiative for Middle East Policy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "should the law be approved, it can mean up to three years" imprisonment for the convicts. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly freedom has been in danger already for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took pictures of the demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">According to Shawkan, more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested during the same incident four years in prison on a court appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2942">It was recently postponed to 20 May, because the prison administration failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom, according to the human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, pseudo-loading of, among others, weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza confirmed the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi session block at Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishments of the journalist Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested during the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists to interrogate documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated on a leaked plan of action. the President of the Republic, according to the plan, was expressly supported by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, would explicitly declare a controversial draft law to the businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption accused of amnesty, provided that they return all unlawful received funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April raises a light on how presidential plans to support the legislation look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected his sources mentioning the article 11 of the Tunisian Press Committee, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to submit their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new rules of the Government Council of the People's Republic of China, users of social media in China need permission before writing or sharing messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments into social networks. it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these rules only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "can we see ourselves in" "" "WeChat" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register as the" "" "organizer of information distribution" "" "in the Land government." ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government lists a list of online services that "organize the publication of the information." the law also allows the government to charge up-to-date services for removing content and to force them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites are currently owned by websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoisseniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has blocking Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">Turkish court ordered the ban Wikipedias in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to clear two English-language articles, the indications that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications reported that the site was blocked because it became" "" "a source of information that collaborates with groups to address a political diffusion campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked its website. it is thus, among others, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop puffing up</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week of leaked documents, Britain's government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real-time and to install Backdoor programs that decode data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal, but has abandoned other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
