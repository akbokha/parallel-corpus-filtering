this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA heard illegal tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a disa@@ strous US intelligence operation in which the CIA gave Iran literally blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has determined risks and urged him to name its alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and sp@@ ying journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they disclose .
so when the government kno@@ cked at the crack , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they stated for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to crack .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and sources can hide more and less .
instead of judging and split@@ ting cracks , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly concerned his telephone calls ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his return of credit , and even travel notes with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack thought source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , justice has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower coming to a journalist .
we are putting the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitution , because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all .
but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer secretly proc@@ ure information , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy @-@ technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is up to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to bring their ini@@ qui@@ ties . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
or the next environmental officer who wants to warn of the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crime , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; ... &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers come to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ok@@ ay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the very first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend from chil@@ dr@@ ens days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are anxi@@ ously waiting for the next release , and on the next uncovered documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ G@@ ris@@ ham novel .
it seems to be away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we address what is going on ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and conc@@ eal their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this issue in the USA .
probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who came to this dis@@ closures , this scandal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , some US states require less information to provide less information to found a company than to obtain a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the United States allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator preten@@ ded to be an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked ourselves that all of us had suggestions on our investig@@ ator as to how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was handed over to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to regard this as individual cases .
it is not a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to complic@@ ate this type of behavior .
it may sound very dull as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that some have begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years we have seen sho@@ cks towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been gathering in central registers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind .
representatives of both parties have submitted a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bo@@ g@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and strive to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally end the transparency that now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I went back to the farm .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stood and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the Peace Corps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me excit@@ edly about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he is planning that . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in there ?
a wild man sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , embarrass@@ ed at the door and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work he bought from me hangs today in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate runs out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can help to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something about it . our apartment is becoming a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
there are no translations available .
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said our last guest and the door collap@@ sed , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ ek@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether this could be a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one closes when visiting .
via the Internet , they can invite other wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the rocket to fire .
but they do not .
nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can focus on the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence by design , among people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of which degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
keep your thumb up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting next to you .
this silent flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
so who now has Al G@@ ores Handy ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is a candidate for the Office of the President ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine that you would have 150 evaluations who all say , &quot; He really can hold very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to hand off your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had delivered their jud@@ gements before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people most , who are the most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by app@@ rais@@ als .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stands out in common .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get out of yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you tell too little , such as &quot; Hi ! &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one nar@@ rates too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal level of openness , e.g. &quot; great works of art in your home ! I make a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to disp@@ el those prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not been met before .
for us , the business is running very well .
of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have made apartments devast@@ ated .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million aver@@ aged nights had a problem .
for people were right with each other .
when trust works , miracles can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travellers who are prone to heart attacks due to se@@ dent@@ ary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save lives even though they don &apos;t know one .
you go to the hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past .
they let you stay even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with monetary transactions conver@@ ge ?
this is an economical trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now simply called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
traveling nowadays is to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you would like to visit a group there Ans@@ äs@@ sig , would wait to fill it thoroughly and show you a district where you &apos;ve never heard of it ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would arrange apartments for a reason on one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of joint participation ?
I imagine cities that enable society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isol@@ ation@@ ism .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already started . many parking lots belonging to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were im@@ par@@ ted to people whose children had moved out . incub@@ ators programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone , 7@@ 85 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreign or even host tonight .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality had already existed before .
there have been similar websites before us .
so why exactly did ours work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted stere@@ otypes .
I think that &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had such a big impact , I wonder why we can use design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply delay the check @-@ in check at the airport .
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think that most of them would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ ch myself .
no , not as homosex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time , it was a feminist declaration of independence for me , and compared to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted passive belief in my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , doub@@ ted , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was tru@@ sting and slow devotion , deep@@ ening with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I know myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone you perceive you fully understand , and yet loves somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I got married and started as all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
to have an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock turned quickly into ou@@ trage .
why should I do such a thing ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Middle ages ... &quot; ... ji@@ had ... &quot; ... bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh , my God .
not only did my country have been attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others transformed me from a civil society into a susp@@ icious .
the same day we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start studying .
I remember seeing myself -- when we drove sil@@ ently -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was afraid of becoming known as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be slow@@ ed down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings did : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were considered Muslims free and sm@@ ashed .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put the anger of people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing to do with questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we release them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mus@@ k .
they talk about my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
the only question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic cre@@ sts .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make America safer ?
it may take a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop terror .
regular visits to a mos@@ que make people more tolerant of other fai@@ ths , and show greater public participation .
and as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
during the ra@@ dic@@ alization process it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts think that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who det@@ ests their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or have fallen away from faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to their imag@@ inations , if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when one looks at them , they do not push what they read in their &quot; holy scrip@@ ture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality to read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense of their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts , who promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive way for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia is affecting me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity , and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if one reports news in which neg@@ atively about Muslims are reported , they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood ki@@ cked up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two elections .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can indeed be a tool for the manipulation of the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
in the assignment of collective guilt it is not only about having to explain oneself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented in the dental faculty , promising , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was ba@@ ff@@ led and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a young man of my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit to her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited her in the afternoon .
he went to De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we staying safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision as it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we went silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , put my shoes off , went into the house of prayer , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the collected were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non believers who came , not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or join those who think : we are better than ours .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with depth , working in a noble way of thinking , that is an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t fool you . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people appear like an exception to rule , then the rule is often broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billi@@ ard business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air parcel delivery into our social consciousness penet@@ rated , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the public .
by connecting flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the nar@@ row@@ est space .
they can also build self @-@ reli@@ ant structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally respond to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of the possible in an autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in space .
in our lab at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
every plane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are at the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine trying to hit two flies with one flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in for@@ wards flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can ho@@ ver and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
but there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which situation the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . that &apos;s okay .
during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions that advance at the heart of the matter .
one such question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that join forces to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts : one prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically most simple remote controlled aircraft . it was invented short @-@ time ago .
it has only one mov@@ able part , one prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and lateral ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is simple mechan@@ ically , inner life happens so much so that it can fly stable and can move everywhere in space .
but it doesn &apos;t have the sle@@ ek algorithm of the stern starter . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right .
the probability of throwing it right when everyone is watching is small , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inside is an exercise in ma@@ dness , this machine is here , the omni@@ copy with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that &apos;s why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
this will give you the ability to perform tasks ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are available in models , the rest is learned directly while flying .
let us take a look at that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate twin prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise .
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when they assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong , a motor or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or one battery -- the machine can continue to fly , albeit limited .
we will demonstrate this by making a half f@@ light@@ less .
the final demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a pal@@ let of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ cop@@ ters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to imagine new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us , the wage is in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and ench@@ ant@@ ingly our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creations to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
at 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled each other faster in a very far distant gal@@ axy . they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy .
for this short moment , they lit up bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not set them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was emit@@ ted into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us classi@@ fy the events at first .
approximately 1.3 billion years ago , just multi @-@ cell life on Earth was created .
since then , the earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands for us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector LI@@ GO : the laser interfer@@ ometer and gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of LI@@ GO has increased considerably , which greatly improved recognition performance .
that is why it is called Advanced LI@@ GO .
at the beginning of September 2015 LI@@ GO was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the detector was commissioned , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ro@@ amed through the earth through the two colli@@ ding black holes .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this one :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell to my death @-@ sick father .
in essence , these were the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of black holes for 23 years and their through observ@@ atories such as LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a wave of gravity is a ri@@ pple in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ ole into the other .
for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers often perform a really oral dance in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ ole at the meeting of the waves . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after the com@@ ma followed by a 1 . so the LI@@ GO employees were crazy .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured to less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the nucle@@ us of a nucle@@ us . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in constructing such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LI@@ GO . Scott likes to claim that LI@@ GO is more than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
it &apos;s different with sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
your child &apos;s face for example .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to indicate the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now is just Alice speaking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can &apos;t make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampli@@ tude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for LI@@ GO , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we transform wave patterns into sound we can literally hear the universe .
to listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies turn very quickly , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . that &apos;s how it sounds : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LI@@ GO the following : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ des noise &#93; No one who knows what to hear is recognized as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s take a short look at what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve one hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the lasting meaning of LI@@ GO .
Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing the way for an entirely new way of exploring the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can &apos;t see -- practical or fundamentally -- not .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these are op@@ ak .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own tail light .
with gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that there are things in the universe that we have never seen before , which we never see and of which we do not have any idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact LI@@ GO found things that we didn &apos;t expect in the first attempt .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , like LI@@ GO them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of what happened in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the universe &apos;s noise and cir@@ c@@ uses .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I begin to play with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : doing exactly what I feared , removed my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an un@@ expect@@ edly kind . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ tens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak breed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
from then on , I chat@@ ted to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a author . I think things out , aw@@ aken you to life .
she is a dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
she is a dream job .
I en@@ cir@@ cled TV . I produce television .
I make television , in a grand style .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
every shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days , four shows , every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three broad@@ casts , four episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : up to 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my TV series run after each other on Thursday night .
all over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are consi@@ gn@@ ments that I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top of that . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing that ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
she is a dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you are now a company , a country or a class@@ rooms , a business or a household , take me seriously when I talk about work so that you can understand that I &apos;m not just typ@@ ing around on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t understand that a dream job is not about dreams .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nowhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if I put troops on the screen , when I painted on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if you have a high tone , deliver a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable .
there is such a change in me when the work is working well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people assume that when I tell them the sums , that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me pleasure .
don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s what she does .
but the hum@@ ming -- when I began to work and work , build , create and collaborate with television production , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the h@@ um is more than writing .
the hum@@ ming is action and activity . the h@@ um is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz then you can &apos;t strive for anything other than the size .
the feeling of not being able to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called hum@@ ming .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s a genius .
perhaps it &apos;s ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not for failure , and I just know that I love the h@@ um .
I just want to tell you I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make it clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more work there are , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations are there .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country that I create , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need the h@@ um . I am the bu@@ zz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
am I just this h@@ um ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out .
the h@@ um stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the hum@@ ming stopped .
the bu@@ zz of the engine stopped .
I did not love my job any more . the engine was out .
the h@@ um did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no h@@ um .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the hum@@ ming and the h@@ um I was .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you love to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates to be , you just love another and that gives you a bu@@ zz when you know the h@@ um , when you &apos;ve already heard the h@@ um , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , can you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things are made aware of me :
first , I must say Yes to all and second , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I am titanium and my hum@@ ming is bet@@ ting , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
we play and her sisters meet , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of mar@@ rying , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I create , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is going to release , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; releases .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can &apos;t believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming is coming back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a h@@ um .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay on the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the titanium dioxide , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe myself using programs and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the h@@ um is not a force and it is not labor @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the hum@@ ming is the stream that comes from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from all guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t think about playing as much as you are working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to be rather than a home ?
well , I do .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
the fact that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we fly around in the garden , in front of and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst bubbles of soap .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always visit my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me how to live , and the universe of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you keep me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show @-@ figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes there is a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit .
and talking my teen@@ ie daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , there is no need for more .
everyone can get up for 15 minutes , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are possible !
my children are my sensi@@ bilities , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what &apos;s good for you .
find out and preserve it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m frustr@@ ated and I &apos;m winning . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a titanium in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the h@@ um came back in my spare time . the h@@ um then seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the h@@ um , the h@@ um is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinners with friends .
that &apos;s my hum@@ ming now .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it &apos;s snow@@ ing to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who plays trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the h@@ um . the country I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the other , the right bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life in me . less Titan - more I !
the more I feel this h@@ um , the more I know who I am .
I am a author . I think things out , I &apos;ll catch you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have every day to do with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
one of the most well @-@ known is &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; this im@@ plant@@ ates an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circu@@ it@@ ry of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from violent trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas the brain sw@@ ells and causes the cran@@ ial pressure .
in order to save life , the pressure of the skull is reduced .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyse the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to make them flour@@ ish .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to manage .
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they stem from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ Cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why are they left to us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in the same way as Jean @-@ François did
and then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we put it on the point of view of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplantation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we rei@@ mp@@ old these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we travel the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we put the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and rei@@ m@@ bled exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been irrit@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we ol@@ ored in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
you had to take the pel@@ let from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they had achieved a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we injured the motor @-@ motor range in the motor cor@@ tex .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some extent , just like with the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side they see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its initial performance before the injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
now see , when we rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ated the cells : the same monkey , two months after the her@@ m@@ plantation .
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have discovered a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I will soon be able to show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fr . Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely look forward to hearing from you .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these types of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you look further into the future , how many years it will take until someone can enter the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
initially , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply it to a multic@@ enter study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy . democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we see democracy not as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as imm@@ utable ann@@ ul@@ arity .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew of Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
democracy is in fact wan@@ ing with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unmistak@@ ably made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , along with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group are wrong , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy .
without democracy , our societies are mi@@ tig@@ ated , our future ble@@ ak , and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin peaks parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , but who are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one could pay the debt mountain and also produce all the things humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sound after a lot of money until one compar@@ es it to the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely did nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in a continuous loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of the investors , in which they do not invest .
invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances cause o@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my Ha@@ ying with Cap@@ ital@@ ism --
his extremely wast@@ eful attitude . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the Po@@ or as a majority control the government .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it referred to the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal weigh@@ ting in questions of state interests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle that shines very bright , it is also quickly burned out .
however , our present @-@ day liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for liberal democracy only emerged when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our present @-@ day demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time this separation of politics and business began , an im@@ plac@@ able struggle between the two took place in that the economy gradually under@@ mined and dis@@ ma@@ stered politics .
are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of its DNA .
it is because it can be in the government these days , but not in power because the power is diver@@ ted from politics into the economy and the divisions are separated .
I mentioned my hands with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that have dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which they feed , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has chann@@ elled policy so far that it har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the inequality increases , the economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ crat &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not fare very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor achieve a position just as in ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
we need to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re @-@ united section , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary .
the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the one in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines are used to serve people and to put their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ ena &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it take , how could it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples shortly .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income derived from capital and of redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but who do not belong to them . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country in a mutual fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to put it into practice .
today , we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe is at the same time liberal , in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all it is a world in which we can imagine genuine democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Fr . Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ se our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m perfectly chaotic .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very gre@@ ek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your speech you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China now resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism to democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill .
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century , smells vast according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experience as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Euro zone ,
not only Greece , but the euro zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely , to say good @-@ bye to ourselves and the continuous denial that a massive absorption line went through the Eurozone and continues to be massi@@ vely under threat to the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial --
unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro@@ group , have chosen the denial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might delay it for a while , but when change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- serious ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request to extend the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders &apos; side to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been conducting a disa@@ strous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the len@@ ders imposed on this policy by the tro@@ ika : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of the talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone has not survived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Tony met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon TV production company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hair@@ dresser and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t pick any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that addic@@ ted , where after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not concern himself on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to prohi@@ bit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium bul@@ lying , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is there , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he stops a competition .
he picks up a lot of ideas for TV shows and picks up eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch them for free .
and when Amazon comes out for nothing , you get too , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , what parts you ski@@ ps or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
did anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top @-@ show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking for them to find a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does it slightly differently .
instead of staging a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows their course , shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they started a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has thus landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating at this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question now is : what happened here ?
there are two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you are making , you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work then this is a bit sc@@ ary , because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison in the US and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , it can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the most know@@ led@@ geable companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad type , through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year around year around year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the most know@@ led@@ geable companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these mistakes , data streams quickly into decisions of life -- at work , in the case of law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people in@@ concei@@ v@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , put this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the items ; as a second you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all own it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is pieces and pieces to be put together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what else they would otherwise have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they competing for TV ideas , when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they always could say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We &apos;re telling the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a bit of clever@@ er like data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball gets smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
