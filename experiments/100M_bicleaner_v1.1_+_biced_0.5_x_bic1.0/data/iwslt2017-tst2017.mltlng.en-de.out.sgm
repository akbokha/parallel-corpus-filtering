<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA heard illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a disastrous US intelligence operation in which the CIA gave Iran literally blueprints for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has determined risks and urged him to name its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblower and spying journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they disclose.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at the crack, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they stated for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to crack.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can hide more and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of judging and splitting cracks, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, secretly concerned his telephone calls,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his return of credit, and even travel notes with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack thought source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower. but instead, justice has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">We are putting the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitution, because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer secretly procure information, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy-technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is up to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have a chance to bring their iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental officer who wants to warn of the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crime, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers come to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say," "" "Okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox firms in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend from childrens days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are anxiously waiting for the next release, and on the next uncovered documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address what is going on?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and conceal their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for prosecuting and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this issue in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who came to this disclosures, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortune in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, some US states require less information to provide less information to found a company than to obtain a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the United States allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator pretended to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked ourselves that all of us had suggestions on our investigator as to how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was handed over to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to regard this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to complicate this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very dull as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite well that some have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the past few years we have seen shocks towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been gathering in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have submitted a draft bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say," "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and strive to end this kind of intransparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together, we can finally end the transparency that now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I went back to the farm.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stood and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. afterwards he would go to the Peace Corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me excitedly about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he is planning that. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I get in there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild man sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, embarrassed at the door and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work he bought from me hangs today in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate runs out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can help to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something about it. our apartment is becoming a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">There are no translations available.</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we said our last guest and the door collapsed, Brian and I started.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Bleekczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one closes when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Via the Internet, they can invite other wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "this will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to fire.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can focus on the things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence by design, among people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of which degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Keep your thumb up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting next to you.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">So who now has Al Gores Handy?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is a candidate for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name; if he had told where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that you would have 150 evaluations who all say, "He really can hold very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to hand off your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had delivered their judgements before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people most, who are the most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by appraisals.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stands out in common.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get out of yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little, such as "Hi!" you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one narrates too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, e.g. "great works of art in your home! I make a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to dispel those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have made apartments devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million averaged nights had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people were right with each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, miracles can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travellers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives even though they don't know one.</seg>
<seg id="218">You go to the hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">They let you stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with monetary transactions converge?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economical trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now simply called" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">Traveling nowadays is to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you would like to visit a group there Ansässig, would wait to fill it thoroughly and show you a district where you've never heard of it;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would arrange apartments for a reason on one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolationism.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already started. many parking lots belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were imparted to people whose children had moved out. incubators programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone, 785 people in 191 countries will be guest at a foreign or even host tonight.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality had already existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did ours work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted stereotypes.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had such a big impact, I wonder why we can use design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply delay the check-in check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think that most of them would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I decided to ouch myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence for me, and compared to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted passive belief in my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, doubted, doubted, and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trusting and slow devotion, deepening with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever felt that someone you perceive you fully understand, and yet loves somehow?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>

<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">To have an accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... in the name of Islam... "..." Middle ages... "... jihad..."... bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">Not only did my country have been attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others transformed me from a civil society into a suspicious.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to travel through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start studying.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember seeing myself -- when we drove silently -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was afraid of becoming known as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>

<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>

<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I have put the anger of people on the terrorists." ""</seg>

<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>

<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "nowadays we can actually hear people say:" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we release them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close musk.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk about my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">The only question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic crests.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It may take a few parking spaces, but don't stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visits to a mosque make people more tolerant of other faiths, and show greater public participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremists think that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who detests their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor or have fallen away from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imaginations, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology on their" "" "holy book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">But when one looks at them, they do not push what they read in their "holy scripture."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality to read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense of their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists, who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive way for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia is affecting me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if one reports news in which negatively about Muslims are reported, they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood kicked up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two elections.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can indeed be a tool for the manipulation of the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective guilt it is not only about having to explain oneself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented in the dental faculty, promising, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was baffled and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such a young man of my brother become such an accomplished young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who visited her in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="376">He went to Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we staying safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision as it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat we went silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, put my shoes off, went into the house of prayer, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the collected were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non believers who came, not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had the courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or join those who think: we are better than ours.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with depth, working in a noble way of thinking, that is an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you don't fool you. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people appear like an exception to rule, then the rule is often broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billiard business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcel delivery into our social consciousness penetrated, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the public.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the narrowest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-reliant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turmoil and generally respond to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of the possible in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every plane has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are at the highest level. for example," "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine trying to hit two flies with one flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forwards flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters, it can hover and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">But there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft does not matter in which situation the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. that's okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask basic abstract questions that advance at the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that join forces to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: one propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically most simple remote controlled aircraft. it was invented short-time ago.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, one propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and lateral rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is simple mechanically, inner life happens so much so that it can fly stable and can move everywhere in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">But it doesn't have the sleek algorithm of the stern starter. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right when everyone is watching is small, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinside is an exercise in madness, this machine is here, the omnicopy with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That's why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">This will give you the ability to perform tasks,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are available in models, the rest is learned directly while flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us take a look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate twin propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When they assemble them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong, a motor or propeller falls out, the electronics or one battery -- the machine can continue to fly, albeit limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The final demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a pallet of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-copters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to imagine new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us, the wage is in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchantingly our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creations to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">At 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other faster in a very far distant galaxy. they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they lit up brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not set them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was emitted into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us classify the events at first.</seg>
<seg id="476">Approximately 1.3 billion years ago, just multi-cell life on Earth was created.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands for us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector LIGO: the laser interferometer and gravitational-wave observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following years, the precision of LIGO has increased considerably, which greatly improved recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">That is why it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detector was commissioned, the gravitational-waves roamed through the earth through the two colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this one:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of My Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying Gravitational-waves of black holes for 23 years and their through observatories such as LIGO measurable signals. what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravity is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stole into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative purposes, lecturers often perform a really oral dance in courses on the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stole at the meeting of the waves. the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. so the LIGO employees were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured to less than one thousandth of the nucleus of a nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in constructing such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott likes to claim that LIGO is more than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">It's different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">Your child's face for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to indicate the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now is just Alice speaking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we transform wave patterns into sound we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been working for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies turn very quickly, you hear the same chirping with an additional key change. that's how it sounds: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LIGO the following: [surrendes noise] No one who knows what to hear is recognized as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's take a short look at what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo is paving the way for an entirely new way of exploring the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can't see -- practical or fundamentally -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these are opak.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the Big Bang is covered by its own tail light.</seg>
<seg id="541">With gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are things in the universe that we have never seen before, which we never see and of which we do not have any idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact LIGO found things that we didn't expect in the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, like LIGO them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of what happened in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the universe's noise and circuses.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>

<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I begin to play with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: doing exactly what I feared, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpectedly kind. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kittens" "", "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>

<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">From then on, I chatted to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>

<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">She is a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I encircled TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, four shows, every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three broadcasts, four episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: up to 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run after each other on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are consignments that I have created myself, and not only produced, so on top of that. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">She is a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you are now a company, a country or a classrooms, a business or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work so that you can understand that I'm not just typing around on the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I don't understand that a dream job is not about dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"" "" "" "it is as if I put troops on the screen, when I painted on a canvas." ""</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you have a high tone, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that when I tell them the sums, that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, that's what she does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the humming -- when I began to work and work, build, create and collaborate with television production, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The hum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The humming is action and activity. the hum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz then you can't strive for anything other than the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called humming.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's a genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not for failure, and I just know that I love the hum.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more work there are, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations are there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country that I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the totals, the totals, the totals.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">"" "" "" "I need the hum. I am the buzz." ""</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this hum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The hum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mom is a single institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The hum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no hum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the humming and the hum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think," "" "Today, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do it, you love to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates to be, you just love another and that gives you a buzz when you know the hum, when you've already heard the hum, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states-waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mum, can you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things are made aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to all and second, she didn't call me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no one any more" "" "kitten." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am titanium and my humming is betting, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters meet, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and lack of marrying, I can't do anything except watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is going to release, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" releases.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can't believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming is coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a hum.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay on the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of work, the titanium dioxide, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe myself using programs and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The hum is not a force and it is not labor-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The humming is the stream that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from all guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the humming again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't think about playing as much as you are working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person prefers to be rather than a home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I do.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">The fact that I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We fly around in the garden, in front of and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst bubbles of soap.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always visit my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the universe of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it!</seg>

<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show-figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes there is a Marienkäfer or biscuit.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking my teenie daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>

<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are possible!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my sensibilities, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the buzz, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>

<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the humming, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have every day to do with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">One of the most well-known is "deep brain stimulation." this implantates an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuitry of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered from violent tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in skull-brain traumas the brain swells and causes the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, the pressure of the skull is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyse the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to make them flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François was able to manage.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are immature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They stem from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called DoubleCortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they left to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing, however, is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in the same way as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we put it on the point of view of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimpold these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we travel the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we put the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and reimbled exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been irritated.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we olored in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take the pellet from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had achieved a stable level of dexterity, we injured the motor-motor range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some extent, just like with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its initial performance before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see, when we reimplantiated the cells: the same monkey, two months after the hermplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have discovered a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon be able to show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Fr. Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely look forward to hearing from you.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these types of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you look further into the future, how many years it will take until someone can enter the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy. democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as immutable annularity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Democracy is in fact waning with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unmistakably made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, along with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group are wrong, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Without democracy, our societies are mitigated, our future bleak, and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of extravagance, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin peaks paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, but who are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which one could pay the debt mountain and also produce all the things humanity desperately needs, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, England and the eurozone, 3,4 trillion dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sound after a lot of money until one compares it to the $5.1 trillion, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely did nothing to inflate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is staggering wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in a continuous loop, advocates the pessimism of the investors, in which they do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily, the circumstances cause oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Haying with Capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely wasteful attitude. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents, and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we proceed: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the Poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy on account of these exclusions." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it referred to the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, that they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal weighting in questions of state interests.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "while Athenian democracy hasn't lasted long --" ""</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very bright, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present-day liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy only emerged when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present-day democracies, since the time this separation of politics and business began, an implacable struggle between the two took place in that the economy gradually undermined and dismastered politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because it can be in the government these days, but not in power because the power is diverted from politics into the economy and the divisions are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hands with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that have decimated the animals from which they feed, decimated that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has channelled policy so far that it harms itself by the self-caused economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality increases, the economic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "democrat" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not fare very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor achieve a position just as in ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">We need to redesign the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the re-united section, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the one in "matrix," in which machines are used to serve people and to put their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of ancient Athena "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it take, how could it look like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you some examples shortly.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income derived from capital and of redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but who do not belong to them. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country in a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to put it into practice.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, in particular against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time liberal, in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all it is a world in which we can imagine genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Fr. Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which is called Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, that's why I'm a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I'm perfectly chaotic.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your speech you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West's view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"" "" "" "in our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I can say so provocative, China now resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism to democracy -- that's a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill.</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century, smells vast according to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experience as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guessed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Euro zone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the euro zone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely, to say good-bye to ourselves and the continuous denial that a massive absorption line went through the Eurozone and continues to be massively under threat to the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Eurogroup, have chosen the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism, you might delay it for a while, but when change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- serious...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request to extend the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders' side to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions running through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been conducting a disastrous program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>

<seg id="1031">For if it does not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Tony met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a hairdresser and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't pick any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that addicted, where after watching a relay, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not concern himself on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to prohibit "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium bullying, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is there, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something like that, so Roy price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he stops a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He picks up a lot of ideas for TV shows and picks up eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And when Amazon comes out for nothing, you get too, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pause, what parts you skips or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Did anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top-show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking for them to find a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does it slightly differently.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of staging a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give the shows their course, shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they started a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has thus landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating at this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question now is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">There are two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you are making, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work then this is a bit scary, because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, it can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the most knowledgeable companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that they can predict outbreaks of flu, the bad type, through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year around year around year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the most knowledgeable companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these mistakes, data streams quickly into decisions of life -- at work, in the case of law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people inconceivably use many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, put this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the items; as a second you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all own it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is pieces and pieces to be put together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what else they would otherwise have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they competing for TV ideas, when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they always could say," "" "We're telling the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a bit of cleverer like data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball gets smarter and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
