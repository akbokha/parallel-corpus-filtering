Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
a mad@@ man institution , where young people are to meet today .
a chapel , which is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers are cultivating the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows that , because the car Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a circum@@ fer@@ ential road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but very insi@@ ghtful .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that you can &apos;t recognize as such .
for cities and municipalities , detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; original sheets &quot; for cities and municipalities , were incorporated into the large map .
these were created according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying authorities between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops departed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a covering Bavarian map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , set up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the official document for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , to be found on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek &apos;s website .
the comparison between early and present is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is under@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbers from the so @-@ called &quot; original recording &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots are no longer evidence of farmers today - but farmers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is distinguished north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the October festival in 18@@ 10 , was actually still a meadow - and no concrete sc@@ aff@@ olds .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the original sheet , in the area of today &apos;s district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one not only reads the street names &quot; on the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district of Munich &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
starting in 18@@ 72 , Dr Bernhard von Gu@@ dden directed the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist , who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the ank@@ ering of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Irish &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
there was room for 280 patients , later extended to 500 places .
sometime this capacity was not enough - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ric divisions , has been located there since 2006 .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um are now meeting at the grounds of the former Au@@ er Institute .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
West lies the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built - architec@@ turally inspired to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ zy , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger Street was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days pre@@ occupation and on April 5 , 2017 , the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn ( S @-@ Bahn ) railway line takes place .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
Om@@ bud@@ sman publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Adv@@ ancement of Far@@ ms has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to pay special attention when travelling by the state , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist incidents occur in the entire state and are noted here , &quot; states the Group &apos;s opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently adopted Bill of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discri@@ min@@ atory complaints , as well as the authorities of the state , which are dispro@@ portion@@ ately targeting minorities , prompted the group to issue travel warning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are s@@ mitten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear discomfort in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being charged with a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report of the Mis@@ sour@@ i Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office , which shows that in the state , black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and employees about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring chew@@ ing money or let their relatives know they are traveling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime reporting program , which classi@@ fies the state regarding the number of such violations to the 16th position of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to su@@ e a company for living or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States adopted immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial pro@@ clam@@ ation by the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ bach Wei@@ de@@ fence Project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U members Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac gave themselves a picture on the spot .
at the right gra@@ ve@@ yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first provided insight into his farm , where he manages 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommod@@ ated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwarzw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing route for him for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste comes exclusively region@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also the Chairman of the Fis@@ her@@ bach Association , he called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electric fence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot manage to profit in such steep areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green areas ensure a lot of work , much must be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and took care of this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he did not conduct bio @-@ business .
for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad of the leader &apos;s support . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
one hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be dra@@ fted for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have is people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants .
the area of conservation is therefore 40 hectares , which are not allowed to be for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
between the total cost of € 71 500 , half of the company was subsidi@@ zed by leader , a quarter bore the community of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ women it is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also for Peter Weiß asser@@ ted : &quot; here , the best food is produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Clear@@ ance Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg permits state funding of electric f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in addition , the area to be tough should not be tractor @-@ driven ( inclin@@ ation over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
the petition of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the fishing bach electric fence project in 2018 .
the cost of disclosure is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump welcomes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller resor@@ ted not to the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty im@@ mit@@ ters would have liked him if he had done it .
but he touched upon its importance , and in particular the importance of which it was written , as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the memorial was completed , his base was added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to mention a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was later added and is not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is know@@ led@@ geable , but as he formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus &apos;s stirring words , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely , and the miserable refuse of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable garbage &quot; was to be seen better on our screens .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump @-@ USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus and her friends , who used to place their words at the base after their death , knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American Rep@@ ublic@@ anism by presenting the female embo@@ diment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic portra@@ yal .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ formers .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American na@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus has changed the meaning of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone but rather an early neo@@ conservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not ligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh encountered here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .
the big imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognize .
their torch should not ligh@@ ten the way , but infl@@ ame the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black celebrates Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the Scottish cont@@ ingent of the world championship leader will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special has developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics needs to learn something from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als nom@@ ine@@ es , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who are competing against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their captain speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in quite naturally were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbeliev@@ ably &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the middle @-@ distance runner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leads along this road and has set up five British and two European records last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part at 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 metres , is another Scot@@ sman that is to be seen after a great season which included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the team captain says they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also be mixed with med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me make it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
what concerns my speech as captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blo@@ gging critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long for the newspapers to strike him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he whis@@ pered in the cri@@ tique , of course .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan to Mary@@ land , who has to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this at the beginning of this week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said a lot of people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair @-@ free head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum , which is considered officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokes@@ woman Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , not a troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I polit@@ ely argued that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical disgu@@ ises and to arrest and silence protest@@ ors .
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mile@@ stones in this question occurred last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County got the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be that difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the Aff@@ ord@@ able Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers beat up on his leadership .
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on the Am@@ ity Treaty , trade and shipping with Great Britain over@@ came his office , according to historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former European no@@ . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led links up to the final round last year , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state .
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the American @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who after his 50@@ th birthday earlier came to the European Senior Tour this year , returns to the action on the home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fewer lung cancers due to passive smoking
over the past two decades fewer people have died due to a passive smoking of lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; said Hei@@ ko Becher .
in comparison , he drew up his own study on the subject of 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonably at the time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the manager of the farm Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which is constantly obstruc@@ ting construction work , is a big problem for St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s construction site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut @-@ off gri@@ ds is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hein@@ ze says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular service buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ st@@ z and Tim Ko@@ st@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ st@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ship in the rest@@ less Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called not@@ a - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the bon@@ ded tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. to wash clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a shel@@ tered room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the High@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders should vote by public lifting before the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea embra@@ ced the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is desolate . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ia and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transport .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and from corru@@ gated iron roofs , which have been tran@@ sm@@ uted by rust to various yel@@ low@@ ish @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indonesian have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans rever@@ ed a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we weren &apos;t used to wearing these clothes , &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but there is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port amounted to $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , the estimated 78 billion US dollar has been estimated to be valued at an estimated $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the provinces that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy are threatening this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal lands in the 1970s were based on the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for Gen@@ o@@ cide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we value everything &quot; in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric blows are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts have increased , because Pap@@ u@@ as resources provide an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing since Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den can@@ te@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to keep up with this .
&quot; migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market more che@@ ap@@ ly than the local ones , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai immig@@ rant who moved to the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native lands - the mo@@ m mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in the country during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter insured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but little has changed in Papua and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we agreed to Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ov &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols off a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorbike .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers fired on their tone and later returned with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their ri@@ fle but@@ ts , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child who was 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ uli@@ a was so badly beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua people , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita dance - running around in a circle and im@@ i@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started to spin the stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TI@@ ME document , which was not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I suddenly got fired into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his multic@@ ol@@ ored wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame does not always know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indonesian only we@@ ars a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings was &apos; filtered &apos; on the following day after Jak@@ arta .
three weeks later , in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic ab@@ uses in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he has a judicial mechanism to settle historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must pass through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , accused by the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of violations of human rights in Papua are already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims opposed such claims with a gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the past three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot dead villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between the villa@@ gers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited village residents prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indonesian param@@ ili@@ tary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killing one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so terri@@ fied that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injuries were quickly delivered here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the TI@@ ME . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called on the officers to hold accoun@@ tability and withdraw the police bri@@ gade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trouble maker for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and ab@@ duc@@ tions of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time economic ine@@ qualities between the native regions and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua people rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , international media coverage remains ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalist Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua ( Papua ) , although they were given the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov &apos;s electoral campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia &apos;s uns@@ ett@@ led eastern provinces of Papua and West pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injury &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; there is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
the local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but wanted to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai committees , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Management .
he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other parts of Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led to a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried on a terrain just opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus , with a head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fires capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is accidentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch@@ el tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the alarm and the cries of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; told a resident who named his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) cleared the fire and cooled the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can rev@@ ital@@ ise questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the gate building after its brand in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the cla@@ dding , the exterior cla@@ dding for decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said they believed that the system of plates for insulation and cla@@ dding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has passed the General Assembly with his Davis Cup coup .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal to play Davis Cup single was only supported on two sets of profit for this sport , not spar@@ sely supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although they often have a very long , but also very appreciated five @-@ pack classic remain the traditional rate .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our membership has not accepted the complete reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will continue to work on improving the applications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not until the vote , after many obj@@ ections , the proposal was already made to fill the finale at a neutral place .
only comparatively small details will be introduced in 2018 : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host &apos;s right in the first round in the first round in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the Organ@@ izer , the demands on training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items to the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey among passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ate or un@@ consciously illegal items passed by the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while inad@@ vert@@ ently carrying out forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had been bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had gone wrong with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted they had know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent were m@@ illenni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent that were members of Generation X .
the most common objects that were intentionally dischar@@ ged to T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
more than 3 percent admitted unknow@@ ingly carrying objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents were also confir@@ ming that they intentionally brought illegal drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it had asked travelers all over the country to find out how many inad@@ vert@@ ently had smu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that the people who were most likely smu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - were the ones who were the most frequent flying .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complex and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they can take with you or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the bulk of the items confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers can cancel orders
&quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is pleased to announce the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has already suggested that some of the customers have already with@@ drew their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ tuous figures for increases in sales and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k , for the first time , betra@@ yed a different , less brilliant figure at the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly assessment : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months Mus@@ k often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics had repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays € 1000 ( in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely back .
currently 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are charged , mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , that the cancellation of so far roughly twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be together - 500@@ ,000 will be , a million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day .
those who order &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never yet tested production lines with maximum relief without any major interrup@@ tions .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if there are more delays , the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in dro@@ ves .
EPA &apos;s chief P@@ ru@@ itt with@@ drew from the dela@@ ying of the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
a day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities towards more responsive than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline which ran for states on October 1st to comply with the 2015 standards for down @-@ to @-@ earth o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the compliance with one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or ham@@ per@@ ing economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was appointed by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , has long been a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly tried to block or delay regulations that contra@@ dict the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al at O@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often failed to meet the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waited to be accused of groups of activists and others and agreed to implement an appointment for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in a regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nonetheless , the EPA &apos;s opinion that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the O@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States , who had su@@ ed EPA this week , said the group wanted to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; revers@@ al of EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their congreg@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting Smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of the public health sector and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cru@@ ising of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ our celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ de Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ de Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen is invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4 : 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ de site is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z ser@@ en@@ ade can be enchan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ arc made to their concern .
Walter Martin@@ i stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ customised book : &quot; Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with its parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
in addition to the former parish church , the wor@@ ding of the document , besides the former parish church , was also a beautiful courtyard to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way around .
so there were also people there .
as evi@@ den@@ ced from the description of the Upper office of Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; is the third , the main settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps from around 1600 confirm these historical conditions .
the Law of Pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval own church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and furnished with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ eath this church to the church .
in doing so , the right to use a priest or the bishop was to propose a new parish priest .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger ones of the two destroyed at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell was first heard in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed out later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were inserted and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting @-@ place for the dead from hearing @-@ silence .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ary church was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was allowed to stand .
during the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 a storm broke down the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the present tower still existing today remained as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ all@@ enberg and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius plant by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ ner Rent@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as success@@ ors of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as organizers , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ arc invite the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade to the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade .
it is designed by Com@@ bo des Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
for the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade there is a trunk before the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers provide fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade is only held in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of significance for tumours and listeners .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ arc are particularly committed to the care of their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martin@@ i re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to have permission from wind turbines to be checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirements for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim fights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was illegal .
the association argues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , since at that time in Vier@@ sen only at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal has existed a wind force concentration zone .
in this area of concentration , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had already decided a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette only a few days before , but the district government of Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve it because of a defect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again approved the wind concentrations zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been received by the district of Vier@@ sen last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to examine the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ ing . &quot;
the NEW re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans the construction of four wind turbines on an area on the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are estate .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - that is equivalent to about one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ sen@@ iors .
the NEW Re plans to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Kreis Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more people were easily injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car drove the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ aer and people from the region are expected to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the commercial club and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the city centre .
as the president of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ shopping &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ tise customers , which offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket cargo .
a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their apprentices@@ hips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the inner city &apos;s shops will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action @-@ weekend , so Christian King .
the City Council and the Trade Association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gewerbe@@ verein &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Gewerbe@@ verein ) and the city enter into another stage of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attrac@@ tively city centre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the well @-@ held Sunday , talks with all the trade @-@ makers and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ developed or re @-@ developed .
this includes both spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the inner city while shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven the city center - to land@@ lords , businesses of the whole city and associations .
it was possible to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly wi@@ dened , King said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; Heimat @-@ shopping &quot; day will take part in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adverti@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can have a direct influence on his own business .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ neapolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them heavy .
according to the fire bri@@ gade , on Wednesday ( local time ) there was still a vulner@@ ability in critical condition .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
an initially missing person was also found dead later .
the dead were employees of the school .
as a cause of the accident , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .
only a few people stayed at the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy during the holiday period .
Tr@@ ump replaced after so@@ aked scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a proposed boundary wall .
the US president bu@@ cked him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ amp to make Mexico pay for the project .
his first call with the Australian prime minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull has also been published and unveiled a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would make him look like a &quot; dep@@ p , &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump termin@@ ated the call after he said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moore &apos;s Ford @-@ massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ long Ford Mer@@ cury passed through a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and rum@@ ored on Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , was able to reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long turn on his cig@@ ar and scrut@@ ini@@ zed the wind@@ shield .
inside , the occup@@ ants ho@@ ver@@ ed in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this man --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man shou@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost everyone in the audience really ki@@ cked out a si@@ gh of si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists have come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our congreg@@ ations , even though we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps to organize the job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia and a lifetime civil rights activist .
for him , the post @-@ position serves as a dramatic appeal to action and represents an annual reminder to the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation unless we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician lays a blanket on the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ching on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files obtained by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ making process .
but no one was ever tried .
although the susp@@ ects remain in the open for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens of Georgia for the first time to vote in the election campaign during the summer .
about the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com has a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight , allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed from prison and approached Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b ring@@ ed the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , evi@@ den@@ ced evidence and covered the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a vote @-@ right massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself register and if you vote , then that will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is descrip@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant and rooted in a kind of deep racism which many would like to believe that he is no longer in America .
it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are then confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I &apos;ve gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - entered a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director of Gre@@ ene .
he has played the role of chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester sha@@ kes and push@@ es him , fur@@ i@@ ously , that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he , win@@ king of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out laughing .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- they &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors thunder@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends ab@@ rup@@ tly and quickly .
there are cries , shots and then still@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman , dressed in a grief @-@ dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie holidays mour@@ ning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their voice is breaking at every second word .
about a hundred meters behind , a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ pes out sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is divided equally between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced all nearly eight hours of humidity in Georgia when Broo@@ ks drives her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse name .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the clan member .
Nick Raz@@ oli embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know it &apos;s not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair from Atlanta is talking excit@@ edly about the reproduction with a black pair they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski was struggling to find words which feelings the performance left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do what they do because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really matters to me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today , this is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds courtyard at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is in some ways inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bay@@ reuth

the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with the Wall of the Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ gue and Ela@@ ston &quot; logo from G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine @-@ daughters pose as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which is moving through his &quot; ring &quot; production .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three Rhine @-@ daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the audience thank@@ ed the ensemble with thunder@@ ous applause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ m@@ ingly , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bow to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in the face of the great heat in casual casual clothing .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team team .
in 2013 he had to let a g@@ ist of the Pfei@@ f@@ konzert out over himself , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing , in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ k@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one real@@ ises that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has grown together in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the d@@ pa performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of what has grown .
I draw a positive summary .
max Quanti@@ ty works as a volunteer
they work in many places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I am helping Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I worked at the school in the open all @-@ day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I did a high school diploma .
and then a civil engineer studies , let &apos;s say , successfully demoli@@ shed .
I realized for me that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what you do .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point perhaps also , really .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social science in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ n Her@@ ne , a social worker training and studying at Ham@@ m at the university of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different places of work during the volunte@@ ering service ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are doing his FS@@ J .
one can do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics here .
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is like that .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as a further restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the job cuts , which General Manager John Fall@@ on were mainly announ@@ cing for late 2018 and early 2019 , are in addition to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in May to revi@@ ve a business which was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the Ber@@ tel@@ smann partner , said that the outlook for the business year was unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter have been injured , announced a statement by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence inflic@@ ted on Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was to happen when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby district of B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a chi@@ ef@@ ly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide rate in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns decision to delay the Smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA in June to determine the O@@ zone regulations - in which emissions are to be measured in some of the country in order to establish where inc@@ isions must be made in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay one year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to re@@ tract a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is intended to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the impact of democr@@ ats and conserv@@ atives , wor@@ rying about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : with two opposing voices , the municipal council of F@@ ish@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will continue until the area belonging to the church has so far been part of the community , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be done by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common area .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council flo@@ ats to view such a communal space as a meeting point only for residents of the senior citizens just as they enter into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knit@@ ting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget in the past fall is due to funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the refurbish@@ ment area .
the establishment of a common area would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , capable of promoting 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed resolution is to signal the investor that he does not want to throw a stick between his legs in this respect , stating that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ er - which is similar to the surrounding building - as well as a pul@@ sed roof - which would reduce the height and make the building more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer thinks that this addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , it happens to the body .
it &apos;s not that easy in the common room .
Daniela &apos;s reputation points to the many of his own buildings with which you can &apos;t move so much , but now you lean into the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I &apos;m so hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger insi@@ sts on the common room - but absolutely against a community participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area one does not grant a grant , but will receive a real , in the case of doubt , market@@ able equivalent , is the counter @-@ speech .
there are three pro@@ pon@@ ents of Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s proposal to track down the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we summari@@ ze the decision , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cyclists is thrown on the road
while crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and seriously injured .
as the police told me , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling with his bike on the bicycle path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from direction Hil@@ den on the way .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the road at the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a car leader in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road , he obviously did not care about the opposite .
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the road .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a retreat .
FC Bayern Munich must abst@@ ain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with human resources , FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season .
seven pros are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
human resources at German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti won &apos;t have to do without the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , adding : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I trust my team to show these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play smart , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the German football heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
walking in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the nation &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to emerge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommod@@ ates the need for information for many visitors , &quot; &quot; &quot;
it combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase up to 2018 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question boxes of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be completed by the Internet .
for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Star@@ Path train is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ t@@ path the viewer experiences a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star lights up more light than another , although it is far away .
I will also tell which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since 2003 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Planet@@ arium Göttingen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiative of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has had something similar to the planned star @-@ throw - the planet path . &quot; &quot; &quot;
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ ae leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Community Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned at the end point exactly in the distance and the scale of one to two billion .
the Earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away , measuring 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet path is a good four kilometres .
while the light from sun to the Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed @-@ star would last for half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a potential show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting pit@@ ching battle in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , the hall@@ way went down to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing Organization super fe@@ ather weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s win by unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ year @-@ world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you a lot of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; on 140@@ pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to get down on lightweight .
and he must move to light weight tra@@ ilers &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
one Ukrainian soldier injured in east Ukraine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later openly expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best finance package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he cher@@ ishes Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday combat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko gave the generous praise to Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the triple fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to do the co @-@ Off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could sense the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight which must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top warri@@ ors , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after tire plac@@ er
during an accident on the A@@ 7 on Thursday afternoon , four people were badly injured .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his car shortly before the end of the market at 16.@@ 30 hrs before the market broad@@ band .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the slope , where it over@@ turned and then fell on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the north for about one hour , then traffic on the left side of the road was passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
and@@ re Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optimi@@ zes the def@@ ences in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result even if the two opponents were not against Br@@ uns@@ wick at 2 : 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three @-@ chain is to be further optimized .
and one goal after a free kick , the For@@ tun@@ en don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one will stand next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team gets better after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain than with the four @-@ chain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will operate in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ chain in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gi@@ ess@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ising and we do not make so many play mistakes in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann will drive to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can focus on the cup we will certainly be able to speak of a good start of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight game days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the Au@@ e players might even be a bit fres@@ her because they didn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against one of the as@@ cen@@ sion favor@@ ites in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 % as they are currently standing , &quot; says the Fort@@ una &apos;s interior minister .
the visitors from the Rhin@@ eland leave the Rhin@@ eland as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep it away , only because we are entitled to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s head coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; making such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish right @-@ wing asylum application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of tested individuals are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ Gaz@@ et ) commen@@ ced the tests last year .
during the asylum process , they should make the assessment of age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years of age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable over the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see much difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person has been assessed for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the studied person is 18 years or older &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biological age in this way to judge is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is incorrect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest risk is if the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 percent . &quot;
full on the plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg are progres@@ sing well .
a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good in time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Building and Transport Department at the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three bridges between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is planned for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is comp@@ lied with .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete which is cla@@ d@@ ded with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it is now in the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .
the two other bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now on Wednesday morning on the northern side has got a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border fastening , which is also used as an operating path .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap should be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should proceed .
the special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
particular finger @-@ t@@ act feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed of the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished first .
for the bridges between the building yard and the bus@@ h@@ ings in the direction of Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the cost of the three bridge costs is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colourful protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is hard to recon@@ cile .
the parties represented in the C@@ ret@@ an Republic ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , lef@@ ti@@ sts ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows peac@@ efully on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle of Ron@@ del invites to a great election campaign .
and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now taking place on the parking lot beneath the R@@ ond@@ elles - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those coming to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that is there .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age @-@ German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered many police officers to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing their presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes is reported by the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic ice , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ es not enough parking spaces exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the Ron@@ del , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the right people &apos;s right , the main thing is that it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what it does : around 20 o &apos;clock a band plays for entertainment on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , several speakers in the Stad@@ thalle , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ woman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the top candidate for the parliamentary election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch keep their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ lach Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos morgen , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo @-@ positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
this is Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ er at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo voice of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new ro@@ be , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; World Music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of jazz singer N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating total work of art .
this core of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram made it especially written for the two musicians and more : the H@@ ash@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly talked about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheeses , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
argu@@ ably the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was Robert P@@ att@@ inson &apos;s &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague , who ultimately worked out bit@@ terly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine asser@@ ts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with everyone I have been writing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never be@@ wil@@ dered me or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered under the loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school years she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , scared and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public does not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to act in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself in front of the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed themselves from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of contempl@@ ation ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic Gover@@ nor . &quot;
the demonstration broke out in jub@@ ilation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally before .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
Justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , incoming message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing scandal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , commen@@ ded on Thursday what he described as an offensive excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be included again in the sport .
Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics CEO Dmit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have been stra@@ pped away from competitions gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 following a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) on state @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress have been pleased that the Russian Federation has realized within itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made but Congress supports the Task Force &apos;s recommendations that this is not the right moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the director of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still insufficient and prohibited trainers still work freely , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral ceremony for soldiers killed in Mali
during a funeral service in the northern Hessen town of Frit@@ z@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
the minister of defence Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the still un@@ solved crash case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two opposite drivers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their profession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter on Thursday .
at noon only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that began the funeral service in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , as well as politics .
among them were Hess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the German army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
roses laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ es and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann took up the flight operations of the helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belonged , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew couldn &apos;t turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubt about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of the Le@@ yen : the deployment was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are being buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not give any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this is what the Royal House shared on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Dom@@ kirche of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and she continued to call it in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , remains unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik has never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he retired in 2016 and also re@@ fut@@ ed the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
while his later wife under@@ took the sympath@@ ies of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a hard time in his almost 50 @-@ year reign at the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik vo@@ iced his remarks about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of knit@@ ting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of social @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wanted rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is following the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a swift re@@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was because of the Parliament &apos;s resolution on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising resignation of a Green Party member from their state parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the state election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CD@@ U and the F@@ DP .
El@@ ke T@@ westen &apos;s previous Green @-@ Members endor@@ sed their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained in Hanover on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to commend his group to include them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats .
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is regularly elected on January 14th next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ Green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government must now decide if it can continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Weil finds it essential that the land@@ grab resol@@ ves as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on further action on Tuesday .
the State Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the State Parliament chooses to trust the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be examined legally clean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all questions will be discussed in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little kur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian herself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a ba@@ ili@@ ff of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their land mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that she returns her Land@@ tag@@ sm@@ and@@ ath she has received over the green state list with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen exceptionally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided not to have any pron@@ unciation in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of El@@ ke T@@ westen to CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group chief on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to quickly choose the rural day .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her late vanity and in her fru@@ stration , the politicians place their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD general secretary Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony ren@@ ders this dirty intri@@ gue and attempts to strike it out of it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ ests of fal@@ si@@ fying the result of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with personal career gifts .
at that time the CD@@ U was the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in parliament .
farm Minister in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from cast iron , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp printed .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless my house has turned off immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the dis@@ may of Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
the trade has just as much concern to the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and harmless .
if the resi@@ due @-@ level of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time not the factories are to blame .
do factories and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , the production plants do not meet any immediate guilt .
rather , they must expect economic damage due to presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there is too little control in the serious case .
is it missing only on the staff or on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 per cent excluded .
precisely because of this , a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the state attor@@ neys in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be available is of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete education from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular bur@@ gl@@ ary in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able foods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fake means that manufacturers , dealers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ sustain@@ ing animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are solved quickly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expenditure of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules that were launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G eventually must demonstrate that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) in order to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar receives a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can easily make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring it into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich family of Qatar .
clubs may use a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to object to legitimate income sources that allow them the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P reporting period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to € 30 million .
and even though Plat@@ ini is dis@@ gra@@ ced by the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , his successor , Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract so that the revenue streams can be reported for the next five years amoun@@ ting to 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of pen@@ alties in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise regular 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing was to exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not qualify as a legitimate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G Pay@@ ments could come to N@@ ey@@ mar via payments from the organisation committee of the World Cup 20@@ 22 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Q@@ at@@ ari 20@@ 22 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be ambassador and a kind of manoeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to find out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to try to avoid any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory discussions with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s removal by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the fair play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is on the ver@@ ge of a possible ending : the airline re@@ writes the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on the news agency &apos;s request a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman .
round 17 million small red @-@ white chocolate panels to 14 grams are distributed per year by the flight atten@@ d@@ ants from landing to the passengers .
Swiss does not want to give any information about the cost .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual sales of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect at all times : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ cking manufacturer .
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants use the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y plans to renew the treaty on spring 2018 .
for the s@@ das , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
chocolate tablets circul@@ ate Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before closing a contract with Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss made the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the launch of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works together with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights the customers of the First Class are p@@ am@@ pered with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class nas@@ chen passengers Scho@@ g@@ gl@@ i of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ g@@ erg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y will also be distributed on the short circuit , both in business and in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneers of David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an embo@@ diment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as a franchise it feels like the time would be short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; did not work surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for talking lots of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors playing hor@@ ny children who will grow up - they still have the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
ten Years L@@ ater , with his adults playing adults now , is less emotion@@ ally u@@ pro@@ oted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the irrigation principle , including a reef on Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle . &quot;
at one point , a character per@@ ks by an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy @-@ evil plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of the franchise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ on &apos;s under@@ lip of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it is the moments of random ma@@ dness that could inc@@ ite this franchise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I regard as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show how to visit the movie premi@@ eres of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon meanwhile reminds of a different type of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its east @-@ west @-@ west ring combat icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980 &apos;s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingenious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan @-@ mask is included - that it plays often like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy isn &apos;t fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been edited to a lesser extent , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian authors were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office announced on Friday .
fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials assured large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
at the same time , two people were arrested in Italy at the same time .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two will probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of over 300 police officers were deployed .
the Mafia members are accused of organised crime crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the Prosec@@ ution established Kon@@ stanz against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .
between the State attor@@ neys in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale deployment was accompanied by four function@@ aries from Palermo .
the investigations were targeted primarily by Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the band &apos;s account .
fashion lam@@ ents big gaps in the for@@ eig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions on asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the representative for the Federal Government &apos;s refugee management , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the regional registri@@ es .
in the case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; partial serious mis@@ decisions &quot; in an analysis which is present in the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million people from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 for@@ eig@@ ner authorities in Germany .
because the data were not adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 was found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer should appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can significantly slow return processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , in the statistics of sufficient tax@@ able people , EU citizens are also included , who do not have to go abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false attri@@ butions , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distorted debate on dealing with sufficient tax@@ pa@@ yers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugees families back to Italy with less than 16 years of age when they have arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this goes out of an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this paper means that BA@@ MF addresses such methods &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , as the newspaper in reference to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state that they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a migrant continues to another EU country , the state can send it back to the inv@@ ader country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the grounds of this , the ministry is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the absorption capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there within the framework of the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful reception conditions and endanger@@ ing the child &apos;s welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ eg@@ chen@@ bach provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
especially Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now shares 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , during the meeting of the council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our body is laid out and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who provide their blood for strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Chief Executive of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Klein@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher talked about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K circle manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change into the theatre has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ straw@@ berry were among the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half so many are booking Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave each 500 milli@@ liter of their life @-@ juice ten times each .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulations over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it held interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members being allowed to climb this month as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly average annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and to 1.6 % in 2018 , and warned that the pressure on fiscal income should continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alled that in the next few years interest increases would be needed to cur@@ b the inflation @-@ heated inflation and it said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected at the financial markets .
members also agreed to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ oth Business Package , which was published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it was said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds worth more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forec@@ asting of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden the consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at interest rates , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts revised upwards for this and next year are in comparison with the 1.9 % forecast for the next year and 1.7 % .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent disap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the increasing expectations of an increase in interest and the GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to lie at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the Bank &apos;s end of the year .
the latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and low levels of sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening is first even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy could not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the income gap in the coming years , but added that wages are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to recover at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the sin@@ king of the fun@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates rose , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected to attract it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that transgres@@ sion in relation to its target of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage bro@@ ker , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in the swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as len@@ ders want to search for business and end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing de@@ als exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages end , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a battle in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis performed before sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service for a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court of Justice that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him .
the move announced on Thursday was acclaimed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be the first to make the registration of people possible , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in whole UK in April 2018 .
pre@@ dispos@@ able proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV medications taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medications in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as long as two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who are eligible for treatment belong gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
suitable participants are identified in clinics , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the drugs this week following an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence as assessed and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing one of humanity &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled individually and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , which leads to the bet@@ ter@@ ment of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV can be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine has been proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and delayed implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is conducted as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they will contribute to the end of the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living a great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed her bags and sold it .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I searched for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted storage space and a mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi of Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms above each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is rather complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed over each other without having to bend us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezzanine there is a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille L@@ ights illumin@@ ate the style of the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut up the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ fan of the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor - or what your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious benefit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square met@@ a of something standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation with one of the biggest real estate imperialist Vic@@ tori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict on separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth of more than half a billion dollars since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
founded there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate and the De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her deceased father , Col@@ in - described by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
one court file states that this means that Col@@ in has property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions designed by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in an Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed medi@@ ators , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , like Paul says , has excluded him .
Col@@ in argues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul of managing some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian legacy prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ it@@ te , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held by law firms .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property , where Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ load of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says he started there when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna de LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with good care to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S Group , with Col@@ in claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept himself very shy , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography of 2015 , Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire is the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by text message to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t really say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ umps of new Chief of Staff are planning to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a smoo@@ ther course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House met on his first day of work with leading employees , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House he wanted to repair : poor information that got into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television reaches back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; police Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to t@@ umps Twitter habit under control , according to six ex @-@ election campaigns , is to ensure that his personal consumption of media involves a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . that &apos;s okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; t@@ umps Twitter habit has ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials do not know what we do not know - that , without their intervention , tr@@ umps would have contained more fuel .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump didn &apos;t send .
if his associates managed to keep him away from him several times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , which are composed of competing parties , are trying again and again to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors to provide doub@@ t@@ ful information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former dump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative media clips , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they come from .
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mal@@ ici@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impulse self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population is asked and hoped for .
the police all over Europe sent postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
as the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy @-@ crimes are not well @-@ known , references from the population are hoped for and requested .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Adv@@ ent calendar from winter .
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting destinations were hiding in holiday destinations called Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online spec@@ s could so far be arrested , at least eleven of them on the basis of references to the publication on the Internet site .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos; range
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners in the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on the war @-@ foot , who negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn from the municipality to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ hull that is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense line and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry citizens have pushed the council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous villa@@ ger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem .
the travellers stayed there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably today even more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long teachings to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local charge if the Council can &apos;t stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inhabit@@ ant who didn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an in@@ fu@@ elled camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to open on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the Atmosph@@ ere Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH as of April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue by the local tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of the dramatic rise of numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and was already talking about serious interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ ise enh@@ ot@@ els , headed by Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , with its seat in Bad Berg@@ nick , acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ nick and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , construction shuttle containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renov@@ ations are made .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room belong to the equipment .
one does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an elevated inner city level , Sch@@ erer says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its 60 rooms has a wide position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already conducted conversations with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , as Sch@@ erer did .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine precisely .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external installations are also brought forward to the fore , this is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace that is open from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair with US President Donald Tr@@ ump , a Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the panel has included the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended his investigation and intensified his investigation .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there are already first invitations to the board in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump@@ le &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence agencies have long accused the Krem@@ lin of interfer@@ ing with the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were agreements between the Tr@@ ump @-@ Campa@@ ign Team and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are to be standing who acted as advis@@ ers to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans during the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also scrut@@ ini@@ zed more and more tr@@ umps for private and business environments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump has personally moved to the centre and investigate whether the president may have obstruc@@ ted justice in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to check the present evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to raise charges .
Grand Jury is therefore also referred to as indic@@ t@@ ments .
most of the time they are turned on when the cases are larger and controversial .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office to invite individuals to interro@@ gation under oath .
according to CN@@ N , invitations were issued that revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ ump consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the interview .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the introduction indicates that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on to decide on the charging of an indictment .
however , the suspension of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
amid the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; Tr@@ ump said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the Democrats a possibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special consultant , T@@ y Cob@@ b , explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
however , this work usually works secretly , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House supports all measures that ha@@ sten@@ ed the work of the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he was not determined against the President .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was called in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this r@@ att@@ ling , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he wanted to h@@ amp@@ er the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a set of investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator and its employees .
that triggered spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theore@@ tically could be fired on ur@@ ges by the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented legislative dra@@ fts on Thursday , after which the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator could no longer be released so easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ice mountain in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg from the just seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has been solved by the ice shelf .
he shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , weigh@@ ed over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometer , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it is mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice @-@ gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
it does not pose a threat to humans .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the abor@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for around 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this may be related to global warming .
the now broken pist@@ ol has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers .
it is thus growing ever further into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e was the balance of wa@@ xing and breaking up a few years ago .
a complete hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is falling apart there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is in danger too , because the front edge has never withdrawn so far as it is at present .
in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece breaks down at one point .
the melting of ice shelves and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and ice as much water as it gives after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth @-@ largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the wi@@ dest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also affir@@ med .
among scientists it is debat@@ able whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf will grow again or fall back in the long run and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; Our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers do not trace the abor@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , however , many king@@ pins of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past decades .
this long tip of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has heated around three degrees over the past 50 years and t@@ ames it to the areas where the temperature is fastest .

because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U calls for the employers to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new positions in the administration have per@@ v@@ aded into the administration .
more than 1100 employees and function@@ aries work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very desired .
there have been around 6@@ 20 applications for the number of places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at the moment , there are still 50 un@@ occupied places by the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is said to work out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers but to counter@@ act the candidate &apos;s short@@ ages in the future , it is said .
the overall concept should focus internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for newcom@@ ers and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition among public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this requires a high number of employees who leave the service for reasons of illness or age .
so high time for action , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ les , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he made a big surprise already in the C@@ ret@@ an &apos;s Day when he publicly challenged the personnel expenses and ba@@ ff@@ led the rest of the parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be examined , which allow a withdrawal from the local employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfying solution in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated cities - should strive for a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff bill for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exact prescribed , increases or more money are only given when one changes to a higher level oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone of NGO Mig@@ rant lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat by the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team effectively worked with human traffi@@ ckers in a way facilit@@ ating illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on the detailed proposals of the Italian prosec@@ utor Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations currently collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that his crew takes ding@@ h@@ y migrants on board , which are supplied to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting supposedly occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the act of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ riding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must above all have an Italian police official who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate Organisation has MS@@ F .
Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month over economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga sto@@ ops for e @-@ sport
do the sport stars in future sit in front of computer consoles , rather than struggling to compete with wind and weather over the stadium speed ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments inclusive of high charges .
these have also recognized the first feder@@ ations of the Federal Republic which are increasingly involved in this area .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sports Department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to attract new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organis@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in which gam@@ ers compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular that young people will go to the stadium even in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially Asian countries .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , you could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation of FIFA are being challenged at a competition level .
long ago , as in normal sport , le@@ agues have long been established , in which the pros compete against each other .
and at the Asi@@ en@@ spiele 20@@ 22 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ć has also dealt with the question for a long time .
e @-@ sport is a sport for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne because he is competitive and show many biological and physical responses , which can also be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction to reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also their body and mind nutrition .
&quot; the fit@@ te player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problems as well : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to carry through on online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports lack@@ ed .
the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are on the move internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ it@@ te and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts the e @-@ sport fast growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tour@@ neys .
sales are expected to be around 130 million in three years .
this is little against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the German Bundes@@ liga .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ it@@ te advis@@ ers write .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; international are already many countries already . &quot; &quot; &quot;
major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
in Europe , too , things are happening .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rob@@ ó .
in the Netherlands and in France , according to D@@ utt , the football @-@ first league clubs are in the meantime obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany la@@ gs behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall into nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer sufficient today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only football stays the way it has always been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , due to the texts that Conrad Roy stri@@ ves to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to commit suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on par@@ ole .
Carter was convic@@ ted in June for the negli@@ gent execution of Conrad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
she had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she did not take responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that they completely depl@@ ore &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a public prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no day at which I am not mour@@ ning the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I am with everything . I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain , which we will carry for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer the only person I have been with since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to claim another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , hop from a building , get up yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .
in moments of suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is switch on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Carter was seeking atten@@ tiveness by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mir : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
it is no accident that Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ley was allowed to run as a captain in the Audi Cup .
FC Bayern will have a big season for the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
something else was different in his room in the cabin , that was Joshua Kim@@ mir immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made the rush to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the level could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Nap@@ les .
but Kim@@ ber@@ ley was also able to interpret the sign from the coach .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a leader in the C @-@ El@@ f qualification from youth players , deb@@ tors and just out of vacation , but he .
sugar is best distributed to those who are given a lot of trust that one wants to keep in a good mood .
so those who were chosen to take part in the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ ber@@ ley confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old entered the field as a Mini @-@ Lah@@ m .
to the right back , that is now its position , the white binder on the arm did the rest .
and at all Kim@@ i worked in this launch pad like the one who can take the ru@@ dder at the best in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ rehear@@ sed tro@@ upe .
he had a look at the whole while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal ended up playing his missing fitness ( hardly folded ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ che hopes to get out of the performance of the Asia trip on Teufel , and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le do not fall neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ ko@@ t .
© Warner B@@ ros@@ . Entertainment Inc .
Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ olos , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted sovereign@@ ly .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le was also successful in the building for a couple of times .
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not as we were hoping for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance when making debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how unusual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers is to be seen after the game .
for example Ru@@ dy did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but definitely six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good @-@ bye to his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new anymore .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies

Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller has announced himself about Twitter shortly before the game and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies wishing all the best .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : business pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs , Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) , is in office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cham@@ bers and companies from the region speak to T V on a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest down@@ turn sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the Ministry is hoping for a planning process until 2021 is to stand construction law .
the West Bank of Trier also plays a role in the plans of the country , which stands in the urgent need for the federal transport plan .
the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says the ministry spokesperson Cor@@ nel@@ ia Hol@@ tmann .
nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier seeks to promote the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sack@@ ed for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro for the passed master examination and 2500 euros is provided if graduates learn to become independent within ten years of the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction will be quick to create facts , at the same time out of the country on the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , head of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
up to now only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire Wis@@ sing at Landes@@ betrieb mobility .
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U faction vice Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf also points to calculations of the Court of Justice , the country invested more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept of how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is further broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies rated net supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
on the other hand , ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the Wind Power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she had already cleared the field because of in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi should change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers are faced with a counter reaction
one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software into more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the chairman of the BMW said that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is a resident - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to comply with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des emit@@ ting diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install systems for the neutr@@ alisation of exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen when authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could burden Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message .
if there &apos;s a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building instruction wants to clear up .
a large inf@@ otainment system is visible on the raft .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding for the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a protected wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , the raft crossed the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ dil@@ los &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n@@ oses and laughter against suffering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most popular cartoon carto@@ ons , the no@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an even records and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist , he suggested himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table , works every day for almost ten hours .
about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ ll characters continue to spread widely throughout the world .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ fold as a counterpart .
his figures speak for the first time in the 3D film that is supposed to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he rather puts on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced verb@@ ati@@ m .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of dro@@ ught and because of the disease @-@ borne insects , which scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , prepare great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which in the spring has brought much less rain and much more in the autumn .
this has implications for la@@ ven@@ der service life .
there is also a small c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro bacter@@ ium that transfers d@@ warf ci@@ st@@ ads , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have developed smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened ones .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 th anniversary this year .
the highlight of the festival is Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
shop@@ keepers , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ab@@ onds or a land sk@@ ater should be experienced in the inner city on these days .
the assassination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to monitor their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children to the office that were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings suff@@ ice .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s salary list or car@@ tels , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accumulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 years since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 .
among the latter is their editor and their inspir@@ er of Fe@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his many books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the 1930s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Special Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders connected to drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely brought to justice .
in Fe@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is still more tre@@ ach@@ erous .
without information about the murder@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the reason why we di@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is virtually nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the gra@@ ve@@ yard is full of ornam@@ ented , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings , which are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a car@@ tel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of the odo@@ ce , has broken the blame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first there was in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival car@@ tel fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
in 2003 , he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined forces with five colleagues for the establishment of the company and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper has earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and revenues and advertising have increased .
repor@@ ters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Fe@@ odo@@ ce , she received prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for their Cour@@ age in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it was leading .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J @-@ award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ p@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take on the task you are assigned as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fe@@ odo@@ ce @-@ Team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the spaw@@ ning bird , who could curse a port worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , always sitting at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine per@@ dition ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and landing run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
entr@@ ust your own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells weird , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the artist Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happens with Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle @-@ class neighborhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who the governor described himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are in fact under control .
for the issue of this week , he li@@ cked out three major stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former well @-@ known Bo@@ xer Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to government spending concentrated on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s home town .
and there was a group that carried out a kidn@@ apping in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosecutor .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this pub , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
just a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez , as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping , would have seen the readers of Val@@ dez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was devoted to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that prot@@ ested against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees had become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ters Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez took a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for a further journalist on the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ mission disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is theirs .
journalists have become lou@@ der throughout the country by typ@@ ing in organized protest &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
since then , she has asked her to be re @-@ classified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
obviously the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kar@@ tell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones are located next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lav Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue , as did El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the murder of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug car@@ tels with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted like the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .

din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian clim@@ ber were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; din@@ osau@@ r found ever , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ r , living in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has ba@@ ff@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something out of the surrounding rock out of place , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years exploring the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ ater , although it is covered with arm@@ our and resembles a changing tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a screening technique known as a counter@@ balance , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed us to get better into its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours searching for it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the head of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it suggests that din@@ osau@@ rs are hun@@ ted by enough pressure from din@@ osau@@ r din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs might have been around the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal on information about his life , including his con@@ served bow@@ el , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , ran into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank to the sea floor on his back .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much farther inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost as close to the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge geo@@ des , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he was buried in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ kept ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips which hung from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ glut@@ ton has been sw@@ ung through the western Canada until a flooded river is floo@@ ding it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the houses still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of maintenance is as &apos; rare as a gain in the lot@@ to .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that bear the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales at its sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
a violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : just under 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , miles @-@ long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) some 20 people were injured at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first information the police were at 17.@@ 00 between the junction points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into one another .
the exact number of the last pla@@ gues does not occur at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of light to medium @-@ heavy injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large range of emergency vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometre retreat was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z journalist , it also came on the counter track to massive disability - due to numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade noted the characteristics of the vehicle hand@@ lers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. another accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : the Group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : there is nothing happening in the train and sleeping .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a genius mind .
and then : exhau@@ sting .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ hi@@ ber@@ ed or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspections .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the driving ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the offer comes , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available at many other long @-@ distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railroad speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the railway ticket de@@ valuation without a conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - which anyway most passengers do .
it is also necessary to purchase the DB Navig@@ ator app , which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one goes to the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seating area Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket inspection at Platz Y he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , simply check in the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ Universität Marketing Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often drive train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the greatest off@@ ences .
because often you have , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents you need to de@@ grade online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card or any other document you have to show is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the part or large room and delays in controlling one &apos;s own ticket and the conductor takes the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is also only on the connections of ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further mer@@ cen@@ aries on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to her core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ roll@@ te by Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police killed just a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ ler @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly re @-@ riv@@ eted on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ ets the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body , which was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she used her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive in the evening .
there were photos of police tape and people shou@@ ting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video she said , another polic@@ eman ass@@ ures his ri@@ fle and shou@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm she took her 6 @-@ year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ uson the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ uson is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as as of the 11th century .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence arising from the viewpoint of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell and her daughter , who wore a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , went to F@@ erg@@ uson , they discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ uson because the police killed an 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take it with you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ uson was located at South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism completely changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was President of the Min@@ ority student Nur@@ se Association as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis and concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r only wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a question came to mind from Fer@@ rell : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and their ability to resist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt &apos;s in@@ mates .
his commitment brought the project closer to Fer@@ rell , along with six other indigenous people followed the Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets team in the years after Brow@@ ns firing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary isn &apos;t someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are represented , because so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ara &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have marked the film &quot; Black@@ watch Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay men must bear the main burden of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is no affir@@ mati@@ c type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film because of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , F@@ erg@@ uson &apos;s communications cameras have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway during a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels obliged to this memory since she went into the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ uson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers talk about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has been dividing the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold leaves the subject hardly any .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , the rest of which profit from the other shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian prec@@ inct is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be an end .
the makers of Galerie @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a Mark@@ thalle into the new building - in addition to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with the opportunity to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been buying almost every week in the farmer &apos;s market for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women of the country love to be very happy again and again .
we also discovered the but@@ ch@@ ery for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery , pay attention to the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but probably the new project should not be very low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of it in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
as there is not even a weekly market place , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is reasonably priced at the top .
as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are rented by larger companies only , because the renting there are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit me together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall sweep away during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spec@@ tra@@ l Bit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gallery start selling all the shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and there is no need to buy a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market hall there is no room for meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ity of many - as I think .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ lifts and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence officer served a 35 @-@ year sentence after making public diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming St@@ resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline harmon@@ ized her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ lady and a pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born in Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison their image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ and @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ in@@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the big success of her 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons . &quot;
she produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg on a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her intimate mo@@ vers became an un@@ equal letter of spectac@@ les , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a comic &quot; supp@@ ressed images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the president would transform their judgment and they were able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama , in fact , only a few days after the book was released , would demand Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and heavy , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually remedy .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality , and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hopes to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how astonishing similar , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing how she emerges with a hands @-@ on hand in the hand of the United States &quot; discipline of discipline like King @-@ Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they declare your speech , then they have won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ as , who assemble like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic Hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that shaped Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
professor of North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University because of murder
a nationwide human race is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University who are searched as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Police Administration of Chicago says that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the site of the event , and Det@@ ectives are investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ ility , vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an email statement that charging them would now be in absence and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ ara . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative agencies in every possible way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Administration , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs and our efforts to locate them strengthen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi stated that local , regional and national authorities will help to find susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building supervis@@ or of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
security cameras confirmed that loading and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand Plaza management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and resear@@ ching a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice President Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian vice @-@ president Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has been entitled to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA driving plan to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ entry of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of dop@@ ing approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in regard to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ ed to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from implementing dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping scandal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA CEO Olivier Nig@@ gli commented that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; to be deployed again .
Al@@ di sold no eggs for now
these divided the company groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could be assumed that no health impair@@ ment could be assumed , it was said in the message .
from now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly tested on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ine anti @-@ lice material .
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency in his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness on your e @-@ commerce startup , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trau@@ mati@@ ze the process .
&quot; there was never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she called people out of the world for help .
a new Human Resources start @-@ up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , offer special groups and demo@@ graphical groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow managers to b@@ ypass and direct themselves to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive Officer of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T won .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ail@@ ments and which managers have low con@@ tainment results - so you can drill down why .
companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you will not be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als ever since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth by 2020 according to the financial website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ ever@@ in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
the Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent offers tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth @-@ maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that employees can report bad behavior .
and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has gr@@ asp@@ ed regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , &quot; said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has appointed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practic@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Commit@@ tees in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry on @-@ line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology for monitoring ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer their software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to win the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
g@@ lit@@ ters secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are more expecting their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only deplo@@ y@@ ments .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you spend your time with a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is hearing their voices and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
data on employee engagement in the workplace culture experts is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can grow dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ fy employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hab@@ t you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to take care of it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t says .
and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gets a new insight into the employees and hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the bru@@ ises
it &apos;s about 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ players enter@@ tain on one side of the new training areas of the team on campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot @-@ tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled at the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Aqu@@ arian Football Center in the morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real pedal mill for the guys , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the broo@@ ks postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six game times conducted in West@@ wood practical exercises .
20 before the start of formal game preparations for its start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we place this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ e@@ ously spread , they are great people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is due to the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been cleared with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective net behind a door@@ post , no easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room and then setting up to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fal@@ si@@ fied messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and then show their results in the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible mis@@ al@@ ign@@ ments and send them to factor audi@@ tors that may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hate @-@ filled posts like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to finding out what stories are being cont@@ ested by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze @-@ music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the irrigation river valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ fully . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ y May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found emotional emotion@@ ally .
&quot; I have only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thumb print !
and letters sm@@ elled for smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome gru@@ b &quot; ) it seems all too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted water@@ pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape painters , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
then at night he d@@ rank whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees were just beginning to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it in the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent who owned something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des said , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; boys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge into English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Car@@ ver that the Dar@@ rell family hid for seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , depicting the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , who produced his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; lords seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys , with a talent to adverti@@ se Er@@ binnen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences after the end of his commitment in the castle .
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : covering 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the eiling of the 301 @-@ year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes on her website that was un@@ folded yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is competing with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a medium five @-@ digit amount for its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
Turkey &apos;s military reforms - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pension and transport in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting did not take place in the headquarters of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the head of the head of the government , the five vice @-@ directors as well as the Ministry of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the meetings .
as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were over @-@ numbered .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed .
since the coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired in 16@@ 9 out of the 3@@ 26 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a put@@ ative of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved directly in the coup attempt , this week has been negotiated in Ankara .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had described the crash test as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but did Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discomfort in military headquarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ rest ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the large @-@ scale printing in the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was firing a number of 7@@ 3@@ 95 polic@@ emen , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als formerly used to be the real masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform specifications of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is targeting an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the attempted coup attempt , would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years .
if this is true , such a development could not leave Nato cold .
in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after pur@@ gations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the Green Card rules
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , more stringent regulations governing the obtaining of vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way citizens are spent in other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media .
ministry wants to rehabili@@ tate track for race pav@@ ement
over the past few months , the future of the sh@@ utt@@ les sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested over the past few months - now it is to go quite fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the end of the year , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourist train &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built on the ailing track . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to secure the future of the racing sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work on the track will begin this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ e the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Minister of Transport Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the route was estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country took over 75 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contract on which the shuttle will also be ordered in future by the country will be finally agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the race ste@@ g @-@ Shuttle should be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , a pilot plant has been used to test whether the route is used by a large number of people to regularly order them again in the future .
the track is also in parts strongly yel@@ low@@ ish .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
just as you thought that it can &apos;t be even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots comes .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , emer@@ itus professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take her as@@ cen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger@@ nail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it gets more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the real B@@ oti@@ x robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing like sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this as@@ cen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female traits , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , troubled one of the most .
on its website compared to True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it said on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy .
their rise and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something Dun@@ kl@@ eres and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional en@@ core .
most men , of course , will not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R records their rising popularity , they remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what transp@@ ires from the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly sophisticated sex robots come up in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexual ass@@ aults .
the most app@@ alling aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The maid &apos;s report &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the ent@@ win@@ ed body and the out @-@ of @-@ eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want it to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , taken to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they can &apos;t separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ary or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to put it in the phrase of 2017 : ma@@ ids
d@@ umps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human understanding
it has become a tru@@ ism of the tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers with advice in the US about how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all preten@@ ding to have our filter bags burst .
less noted is the power to bring m@@ umps , families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which they strug@@ gled for decades for politics , suddenly and quite stran@@ gely on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is also related to the fact that this also involves considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push all of us to the right .
when we talk about &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his kit@@ tens will no longer rep@@ el us .
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the Right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards .
today I find myself attacked by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return saw ) - both of them in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact appear to be a very mild crime .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cra@@ mp@@ ed and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the per@@ pen@@ di@@ cular music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disap@@ point : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Top@@ ic Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not one - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked for it .
on the other hand , in a department store , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic , while I was tired of making my credit card rich with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us for the second time left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was hospit@@ alized due to the treatment of cuts to his hand joints , which he re@@ port@@ edly suffered from the prison authorities in a case in his cell .
after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to death by an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin at his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der who hid in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to present this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they were too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ t@@ ank@@ ers from F@@ aro@@ l and E@@ öt@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the college students will go to high school in the future , four at the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , Mrs. Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ öt@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of school dis@@ miss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eag@@ les growing up in the h@@ ens , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the h@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of a hen c@@ row , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making him a chicken sm@@ ashed , the eagle broad@@ ened his wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
after that , classes three and four showed a hen &apos;s dance in Y@@ von@@ ne Frank .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ dd@@ les , the cylinders were wearing to raise the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kit@@ ten is different from the other kit@@ tens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished all four people that he feels accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a letter of appreciation to the colleagues , the former head of the school , Michael Müller , who always starts with teaching passes , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the time for cooking is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher explained .
after two years of teaching , she only divor@@ ced her students , because it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ wheel @-@ cool@@ ers .
finally , all students completed a song of summer time and holiday time .
at the same time , great joy broke out with the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulgarian arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced , quoted on television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal refugees detained in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police , including the two Bulgarian nationals .
on the same day they were released whilst an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camping and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the campaign ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
BMW , Daimler , Opel and VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars at the diesel summit .
they are intended to improve the emissions of emissions from emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives ratings :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the software updates negotiated are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler announced that it will write to each person concerned .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the framework .
how long will the retro@@ fit take place altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this is the result of the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update last ?
retro@@ fitting could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming it could be to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ orists who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE indicates to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin would .
is there a massive decline in price of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but it is precisely in the regions where driving b@@ ans are threatening .
so far there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the A@@ ce reveals to wait with a sale yet .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Award Gala is one of Washington &apos;s gl@@ amor@@ ous events .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) as well as the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lage ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and attend the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the winner Le@@ ar , who has become a progressive TV series , already announced that he would refrain from taking part in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that weighs on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the talk with Tr@@ ump to make clear her point of view .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .

Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach City Buil@@ der , will reti@@ re next year .
the job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been a town builder for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he teaches in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it is surprising that so far no application has been submitted to the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this should be enough time for a revision taking into account regular periods of notice .
since Has@@ lach is acting as a sub@@ contractor for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant has to present appropriate degrees .
this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could no longer fill it , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but clos@@ eness to the citizens is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reported a good working atmosphere as well as good mood among the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure of the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ el@@ ho@@ fen parking area have been initiated .
the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , the stadium renovation is still an issue .
the latter alone will cost some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work here is fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a city builder there is great scope for design .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and garden landsc@@ aping , many things can be re@@ acted very flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble is listed as an ensemble , it is important to &quot; keep an eye on what fits in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city architect emphas@@ ises .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister will bear great responsibility anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a client , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything is going through my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of service in support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been with him for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wants his successor for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good company climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if you would like to get to know Roland W@@ acker , you should have completed an academic degree as a graduate engineer or a b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s degree in architecture according to the town of Has@@ lach .
the municipal authority under@@ goes high@@ - and civil engineering , construction management planning , property management , municipal property management , urban depot with building yard and city gar@@ dener , as well as the underground building rights authority including monuments protection .
bicycles to be thrown on lines : road track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway slide show in the area of the Le@@ oben Strasse ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships .
these were so heavily damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night .
near the crime scene , a red sco@@ oter and a bike rider had been watched by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ st@@ reich &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch at the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rator would have put himself in great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility , as well as the delay and the costs for rail replacement traffic , P@@ ön@@ alen &apos;s railway customers could also come to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were rec@@ tified on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern route could be guided without obstruc@@ tions .
nearly ten people had dropped out Friday morning , two of them entered the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch some 200 meters of overhead cables had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the inc@@ urable state , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found out that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium tends too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium inside their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of l. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han encourages more toler@@ able , less inflammatory bow@@ el mili@@ eus if the same system also s@@ wir@@ ls in people .
the post @-@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same family , which was kept separate , did not .
it suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced in DNA and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were created by the L. Stick and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers led L. cross@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then passed small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice &apos;s feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice and that most of us L rep@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han side products from L. rep@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. Qu@@ reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million Po@@ und signing of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the H@@ alter role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira have mar@@ ched at will .
matic , however , was excluded from the pre @-@ delivery Asia tour of the blues and took only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve prior to the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start XI for the start of the season .
the Independent disclosed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wished three more new commitments but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. airplane manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in the US state of Mich@@ igan and moved in the shape of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , that is several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such commerci@@ als earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind whir@@ ls : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked at Berlin with a certain concern .
only there was no fire from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the League - that was the most important wish of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has fundamentally changed .
since then , the employees of Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House , with increasing horror , observe events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were set@@ backs .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber on the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Green Party member has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the election of the State Parliament , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from the CD@@ U and the F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ westen to give back its mandate .
the transfer to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal managing director and election campaign manager of the Gre@@ ens editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner sigh@@ s when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after the tak@@ eover of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen there .
it is the provisional high point of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades cal@@ med down at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this became even worse - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into stag@@ gering , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te beat the party smoothly .
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously til@@ ted again in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next set@@ back .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD governor , lost his nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he did everything wrong after that , what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
© Warner B@@ ros@@ . Entertainment Inc .
because of the VW exhaust @-@ gas scandal and its role in the Supervisory Board , Lower Saxony &apos;s prime minister has been in criticism for a long time now .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because in recent weeks , Weil tried to set accents in the federal state .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not concealed by comrades in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they spoke of Weil a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
because of the parti@@ san pressures of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens , there is basically no fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not even Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the time being , comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , how Mrs. T@@ westen combined her own career interests over the interests of everyone else , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen is not chosen because of her person as a direct candidate , but has been elected to the parliament via the state list of the Lower Saxon Green Party , according to the de@@ pu@@ ties of Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters aged four years ago was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Weil on the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the lower @-@ Saxon SPD as the leading candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there have been more or there have been further commitments of the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding for local people III
those who want to renov@@ ate their house in the years may soon get support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives St@@ eg city development on Wednesday in sensi@@ bilities were informed .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been sens@@ ations in rehabilitation areas .
back then , in the refurbish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the refurbish@@ ment area between 2005 and 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , previous refurbish@@ ments are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote inner development , and not only to open up new construction areas .
on April 4 , the government pres@@ i@@ dium Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a refurbish@@ ment area III .
the sum of the funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 euros come from the country , the rest of the community &apos;s feelings .
how is a san@@ itation area now created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will continue to investigate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area in general .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could be postpon@@ ed again .
the jet@@ ty was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal states programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be objective @-@ related , that is , per property , carried out .
the area of rehabilitation would then finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for the funding period has been running since January 1 , 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
even until September this year , however , the assessment would only take place once , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the deadline is to take place as soon as possible , so that the renov@@ ations can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that each commun@@ e had to carry out the said preliminary investigations .
the aim is to evaluate and decide when the urban@@ istic gri@@ ev@@ ances are to be assessed and to what extent .
there will also be a san@@ itation note in the land register for the respective property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann , once more , will come again and get a picture of the situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel emphasized that the project was a key success factor for the project involved .
therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which includes , among other things , the structural condition and refurbish@@ ment views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey Ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , distribution and habit@@ ation of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business arch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled when business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is to be noted that Got@@ o pointed out that a filled out questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler also emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; func@@ tioned - whoever comes first , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first .
you cannot reserve funding for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the audience a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between the thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ ing an@@ aes@@ thes@@ i@@ ologist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to make sure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra cost of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built in both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the White House advertising costs pay thousands of tax@@ pa@@ yers
the White House decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military &apos;s data left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the President is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials from the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was exhibited next to a yacht in Ma@@ ine , a fire truck from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the Military Bureau of the White House called for the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the Chron@@ icle of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the Assistant Nav@@ al Officer of Aviation .
the news showed that on July 17th the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long remained until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 was cleared this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second crew was required for the return flight due to the restriction of the service hours .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground on the plane during the time .
the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME did not reveal whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act provides federal states to use state property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the destiny .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the command@@ ant wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was referred to as the official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform the health reform that was going on in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but its use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thrilled by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows products from all 50 states manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn areas to set the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicopter units also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; Non @-@ Pres@@ idential Com@@ missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman for Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to reports from the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flying lesson .
unit records list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the refund rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at this time , the former White House press spokesperson , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course it is appropriate to highlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter than he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down into the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky job
leading the second Tennis Bundes@@ liga is the leader of the Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss arrives tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ular third Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V .
despite the still flaw@@ less balance sheet , the top @-@ not@@ ch of the Second Tennis League has retained the sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in a similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the post@@ erior pole positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorf S@@ V mainly the imports from the high North are concerned .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to missions in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ rot@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the north is practically inde@@ b@@ ted .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the Fren@@ chman is not active in the Chall@@ enger Tournam@@ ent at the Italian Bi@@ ella tournament , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , playing at the tournament in the Czech Republic of Liber@@ ec , is making his first commitment this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chi@@ lean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ three V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky at the A@@ TP tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he was also to be present in Kiel , as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the Club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also return to the team again .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , does not fill the cad@@ re from the trainer at Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law on the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrapped up a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft envis@@ ages pun@@ ishing European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors from the local O@@ MV , which co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian East @-@ Soul group Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies , are accordingly troubled .
the threat is enormous .
however , it is too early to estimate the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen what the group could resist and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ co Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put in the center of the charts by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which is revealed by Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars killer , the Net@@ fli@@ x series is not over yet .
the seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug traffic in the world : the Cal@@ i Kar@@ tell .
led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the car@@ tel , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Am@@ mann ) is their head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , who invites U.S. and Colum@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ co will begin on 1 September .
role backward : the city provides 46 kitchen@@ ettes
the town organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with strong contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the urban day@@ care centers .
on 1st September the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of Youth Wel@@ fare Department , this is a good news : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
cooking continues to be out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and delivers freshly cooked ch@@ illed .
the town runs 46 day care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , and in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past kit@@ h year 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are served 45 weekly hours eat in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid for 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay until 2@@ pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff have kitchen service from September 1 : they heat the cooked foods , complement them with salad , raw food and fruit , portions the meal individually , give the food , clean up , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees are assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are double @-@ group@@ ed as well as seven @-@ line facilities - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - is done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of kitchen performance , also the charm that it turned out to be the most economical in the cost @-@ comparison of the city as the most economical , it is said from the Press Office .
and that , though 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight with around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative when all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are chann@@ elled in the Council elections in the provinces . three women are chann@@ elling for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women &apos;s role cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition of international fighting to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make a commitment to the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow , at managers of bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which , in addition to other products , produces hob@@ no@@ bs and r@@ ich tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call for &quot; concerns that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we have no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross from the general site manager is deeply concerned with our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers strongly focus on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production down@@ fall , the eastern end of Glasgow is desper@@ ately needed for a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland just yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it because we value the continuous commitment among staff and union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we regularly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are fully aware of the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production . if our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; side of La Liga &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likes to regret his interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not dimin@@ ish in her persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after leaving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release his release clause , but did Barcelona warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach heated the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world &apos;s highest @-@ paid professional athlete . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar forced his way outside , although a spring near the Catal@@ ans board insisted that the club has always done its best to care for him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City celebrated an interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi held a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circum@@ stance , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price deals for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW came from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese .
in the vicinity of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane so that he had to switch to the right .

interview : &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen account is reli@@ eved by Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases is reli@@ eved by Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; We are the Church , &quot; declared after publication to the German press agency , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former Regen@@ s@@ burger Bischof and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral @-@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would be very useful for the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their wrong assessment of the processes at that time .
on the other hand , the Vatican magazine &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; critici@@ zed the fact that there was &quot; double standards &quot; in reporting on violence among the cathedral @-@ cats .
in regard to the ass@@ aults in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is a &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future . however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ an and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee , is striking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are happy to go on to the church and that &apos;s a gr@@ ind fres@@ her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strikes have been a normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on mis@@ use cases , also Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appeared .
the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger , writes in 12 languages .
&quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber who was entrusted by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is said about Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; so , in summary , it can be said that in many cases , the domain master R. has been used in many cases of forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be even more intense .
in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , however , many victims count on the fact that many victims valued the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview , Mr Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , is reli@@ eved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence on protection of protection from the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , many students stand out for their &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ ery and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became handy when a domain spar@@ ed no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole length of 440 pages long from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all .
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool were also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside its sphere of influence .
you can at best throw at it , experience it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger described him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; intel@@ li@@ gible , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who supplied the boys regularly with cakes , biscuits and candy and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also sometimes led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ bru@@ chen .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just pop up with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the floor , but also made ear @-@ cow@@ ards split and over@@ ly che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he has already admitted many years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his honour , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period , in the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you know such methods of breeding ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state high school .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , they are Bag@@ at@@ ella .
one wonders if it is not with his acquain@@ tance and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI has to do , that many media r@@ ushed straight to him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , the report showed a lot about the topic of abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will George R@@ atz@@ inger lay out any involvement or complic@@ ity in sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claim to have entrusted themselves to the domain master .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the const@@ ern@@ ers on behalf of the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .
what is the evaluation of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely insights and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ rator .
I think it ... even for really absurd to assume that all of the people of all things have opened themselves more vivi@@ dly or even more clearly , than vis @-@ à @-@ vis their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trusted teachers , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the run @-@ up to the students and / or their environment , they were not confirmed in the context of the examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any complic@@ ity .
in this way , he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to an ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate a good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; watching &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in the coverage of a huge deal of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is , in turn , an abuse of the report .
it is separated clean@@ ly : between the primary school and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , let us say , other accus@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the cathedral spar@@ rows .
all the aw@@ ful test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys were can@@ on@@ ized and portrayed by sa@@ di@@ stic teachers , were all in the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have had to prevail .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do because he only got the boys face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paradise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims valued the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
at most it remains the repro@@ ach to have stolen away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then back in 1993 .
did George R@@ atz@@ inger stick his ears consistently in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , which even re@@ produces the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the punishment will continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press release , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test convi@@ ctions were banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they were in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows well .
it was also difficult for him to estimate where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been crossed .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 , the punishment of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis maintained that it was unfair to apply the present @-@ day pedago@@ gical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of judging the past of today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess is already right .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and not for what was broken down in the primary school of ad@@ versity and violence in innocent children &apos;s souls .
that &apos;s all really aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be worked up .
but at the same time I must take the protection of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , thus sla@@ ying the ear and the ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has shown Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of test re@@ pris@@ al also come to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI said from his perspective , that the cathedral @-@ cats only played a secondary role .
nevertheless , I do not at all hide from the fact that there was a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the earlier rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
with cookies and candy alone , you do not make a big singer and stand before any success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and overcoming .
what kind of person did you have for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , gra@@ cious , deeply believers and heart @-@ hearted people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do anything else just a fly .
I get regular contact with , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his gradu@@ ation , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are thank@@ ful to him today that he en@@ riches their lives and has brought them to the world of music .
and that he always is a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ability , to which they still look up today and which they almost ven@@ er@@ ate .
and please , once again clearly : everything that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be happy that we have long been overcome this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is most unfair , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
the evil intent that is behind it is only too obvious .
for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him .
now the settlement would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
