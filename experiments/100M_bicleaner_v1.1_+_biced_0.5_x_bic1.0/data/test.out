the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a , announced the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had taken his dream job six months ago as a chef in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother , who sw@@ am with the river .

Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m getting stuck in drawers
Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now made it clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always put in drawers or glued from outside label that usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather dum@@ my for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
most of the time the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of the TV with delicious de@@ bris and Mexican food , it says in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as an all@@ ying mother of two sons .
the film will take place on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport Py@@ ramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues sought a little change with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they drove home to the trou@@ gh for the fast gal@@ lop .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and that &apos;s what the riding career ended up with .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time was - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he let himself go with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even ho@@ ver himself for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid presented the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala decorated the Golden Sport Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ athetic sports@@ man .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , silver bay leaf , Champions Tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen hasn &apos;t added it to him .
the 18th prize @-@ winner of the Sport Py@@ ramid is long .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it will not only be awarded for sporting successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting offspring .
and so he continued with the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the results include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ant , the founder of Cor@@ nel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ Driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eck , the Spring@@ field Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ Preis ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ ump Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trading agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump intend to do .
however , the two U.S. presidential candidates are not un@@ affiliated with fiscal and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claiming Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive back regulations dras@@ tically , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
that is why taxes for the rich are increased , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in which must be invested , tr@@ ump and Clinton tend to say almost verb@@ ati@@ m .
the democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apar@@ ty wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so there could be party discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate agreement wants to termin@@ ate it .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and demand the renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want we to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply better protect American jobs .
they should be paid even better , for example , Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ att@@ led , then he says that he cannot be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in boo@@ sting growth .
his critics point to him that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least the rich demand that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who escape alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each one has a baby that is at the most a year old .
one has placed her little son in her arms .
he gaz@@ es curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social relief services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for women refugees and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs joined the organisation together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid Association .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they are threatened with torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope @-@ bear@@ er , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many secretly steal away because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have experienced sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that is what drives them away .
on the escape this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ g@@ boats , for example , demand a sexual act for a bottle of water , is no r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who think that as soon as they fall in Germany , B@@ ahr relates .
here too , single women in refugee camps are often regarded as inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the Munich North are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not dare to talk frank@@ ly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know to help , it needs more accommodations only for them , B@@ ahr calls for .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
to the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers with no .
there is no such thing in the governments of the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fled women are not accommod@@ ated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important for men and women to be hosted separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing or men and women are housed together , it can become more perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the urge to get it to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us that we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily create a second home .
assistance Doc@@ tors Stri@@ ke : demands for new Work Campa@@ ign Pro@@ visions
representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new combat activities in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for the whole Council to appro@@ ve more work campaign measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers agreed to respond to the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , assistance physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the Chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , leading to the fact that the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and demand official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Board has submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council today in order to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating work campaign measures starting in early September .
the disputes resulted in the fact that assistance physicians in this year struck six times , the first total failures in the N@@ HS history .
the head of the BM@@ A assistance doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians and medical students , with the benefit of the agreement to be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hand over their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counterpart in the gold @-@ plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed nar@@ rower and he did not radi@@ ate heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if there had never been a bad thing .
to me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin announced and accused Ankara to fall back on Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was done by a supposed friend .
building up the ve@@ to becomes difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one point it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the most serious accus@@ ations were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been removed last month with a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at almost of his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght to the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the state television approved cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists are long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West , as it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer .
in addition , the continuing gru@@ dge of the EU accession negotiations and Putin , which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West .
the Russian head of state in Ankara won with security a bonus for claiming support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is clearly a matter of course for Moscow , which even has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described to me : two countries that break away from the West and feel bad and now unite .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey are supporting opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents concluded at the press conference that they would not even have gr@@ asp@@ ed the subject .
the president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin chose to stress them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
according to the Board of Directors of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand has to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and rescu@@ ed eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from six Nations ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized Head@@ quarters and Stock Qu@@ otes to Nat@@ West will be changed .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private client business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals but local objectives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it won &apos;t continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of Staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said that we would be a great bank for our clients and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling Champ@@ agne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th gain
the jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local circuit with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won at G@@ ha@@ yy@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here as well
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he picks up the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ b@@ ysi@@ um had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Care@@ er victories
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only a few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already taken 6.000 profits if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered almost 30 years of winner in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes on Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori , has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t finished in the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue at competitions up to at least five years old .
Russian President hum@@ bles Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov &apos;s chief of staff .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the nar@@ row@@ est circle of confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Repres@@ entative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin it reads that without giving reasons , Putin has ordered the resignation of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been his deputy since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow International Relations Institute ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is said ( in Russian ) that he was later the director and chief executive of the government staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin announced on Friday the Russian TV station that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince you ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works as he is for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff res@@ igned at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so is the episode of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this right now .
but the official claim - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , wants to direct Russia &apos;s environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated position - one could almost say - to entr@@ ust sh@@ allow@@ er posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , as Putin , a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
it was once accepted that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of office viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally of Putin &apos;s allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producer
Gib@@ son was involved last month in a physical examination at the set of the show in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced their termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ host , ap@@ ologi@@ zed Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set there were artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how Gib@@ son &apos;s character is written out of the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , are expected to be published at a later date according to the ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my entire lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gib@@ son said in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but it won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned broadcasting of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a villa@@ in of Ban@@ ff called for help in the identification of the fish , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be a sand a@@ ale with the 75 fish that were sp@@ iced out by a fountain of foun@@ tains .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ a Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ in cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ in cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly ep@@ ical degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the gap between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a tricky job that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fitting .
in total , almost 79 % of the entire deck are at their place and the last section of the deck is today in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete deck for the deck , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first lock represents a significant milestone for each bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower , we had to close the gap on the north or the landing page .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massi@@ vely , since the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters .
luckily everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from ang@@ es@@ ey by their fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue unit struck alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty floating in safety while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat rolling in close proximity and made us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a Bo@@ je without life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the rescu@@ er boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engine had an emergency stop , the boat was released from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .

who is building Braunschweig &apos;s favorable apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : investors should be taken much more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 homes over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; housing concept living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
© Warner B@@ ros@@ . Entertainment Inc .
first of all , the question is : who should build the affordable housing ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas have to reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can however also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , is to provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants to create even tough@@ er conditions for investors .
no matter what Brat@@ mann does , there is a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approx . 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one compensate for the loss of further around 1300 favourable apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bought from the city .
in addition , we would have to think about getting apartments back into price band@@ aging .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke , the problem could be solved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in the western city there are periods of time coming out at the end of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price band@@ aging for affordable apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social housing in the Western city is dras@@ tically increased , the aim of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mixing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go with the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , I concentrated on more building plots for single @-@ family houses .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found ?
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens has been lam@@ ented by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go makes it all about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
naturally I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created . )
as many phenom@@ en@@ ons of pop culture , interest in the game was falling in the US , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ weigh@@ ed the servers .
within days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ em@@ on that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the U.S. , the game led to a si@@ ze@@ able increase in steps that lays down the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes , rose from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data for performance enhancement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly drive sport reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that &apos;s too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close friends on the hunt .
as always , there are also stor@@ my gam@@ bl@@ ers who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what &apos;s it supposed to be ?
a breakthrough occurred .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit have been able to track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to play sports as it does .
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , fit@@ ter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all of this .
dynamically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant all the way .
and now also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast kno@@ cked on Thursday for the title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly rais@@ man and the Russian Bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nes on the balance beam during the individual multi @-@ campaign camp of women in the arts gymnas@@ tics at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , winning a championship title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this success places them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of its sport , 15 world world med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescu@@ ed from her said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awaited her last examination in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered disappointment .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly rais@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the women &apos;s sing@@ les campaign at the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clam@@ ation mark on the farewell celebration of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insisted on never having planned the future during her long walk , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no accident .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym where Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no competition for competition , a series of victories that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina easily led through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
aerial beams and ground floor - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ ked .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and placed another 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
she embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as she expected her final bear - a mere form@@ ality - and tears poured into bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; gran@@ ny &quot; by the Americans , had a head start .
after her practice , she threw Kus@@ sh@@ ands to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which at times seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning :
police : 3 victims killed in serial killer when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of Phoenix &apos;s dead@@ liest attacks for a decade , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Ro@@ ch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police announced that the triple murder did not appear to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y accident , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokesman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said the sho@@ ot@@ ings led the investig@@ ators to get a closer look at if they were connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic living neighbor@@ hoods in nine months and two others were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , announced at the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liners , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which took half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his Alter@@ ni@@ mates , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was that I couldn &apos;t do that .
I can &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let myself on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told Ed@@ mund will never be able to see her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund hasn &apos;t been able to sit or craw@@ l until his third year of age and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has thought for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him sign language to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund invented a few characters on his own .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and pre@@ dictions can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional cost of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis since a long time , because I don &apos;t expect anyone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
it gets better .
they know that it will get better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rain@@ falls , floods cause ba@@ il@@ out in Louisiana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more ra@@ inf@@ all .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rain@@ falls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Louisiana , John B@@ el Edwards , announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and already on the road to help the communities affected .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared with the fact that the requests for flood @-@ vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags grew .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua had claimed tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Louisiana to Saturday .
the weather service reported that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ites near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the A@@ mite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Louisiana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ tmann says that both rivers can flood many houses in the subur@@ b near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
it also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger as it will only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the tro@@ dden rivers .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi Bas@@ in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams have always associated people from floo@@ ding in the A@@ mite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and son &apos;s son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rises greatly over night .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby has warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and came in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer would have rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the flood was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spreading rapidly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ tmann , an observer reported from Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the soil was substantially su@@ cked by the ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa par@@ ish and ou@@ tage in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated into two churches which were now both flooded .
the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed by floods .
in the cities of A@@ mite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ acu@@ ees .
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will return to their homes again , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to high water and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents who hope to be able to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported as flooded , but no reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in A@@ mite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfor@@ ated by balls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police report that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents believed that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm , and abdom@@ en , but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital .
&quot; he did a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe that simply .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that it is likely to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently had come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ lap the crime scene .
it seems that this is definitely an ongoing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were cas@@ ings .
it seems that there have been several armed fighters who were involved very actively , &quot; said police officer Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and police re@@ port@@ edly reviewed the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross@@ beam when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still searching for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ning and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been at any Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second , this crew has three tur@@ ners , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly rais@@ man , the Jew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lic@@ in , makes everyone proud .
this team at last reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female female singers was an African @-@ American woman .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ rating routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual amer@@ ican woman who won gold at an individual event for women .
team member A@@ ly rais@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the peak of this sport , but so do gym@@ nasi@@ ums throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all went the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four tur@@ ners in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is a cost@@ lier sport and Tur@@ ner is primarily involved in private gymnas@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) .
the majority of these Turn@@ clubs are located in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started the gymnas@@ tics .
we have to emp@@ ower the municipalities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie to provide a more affordable and accessible exercise training .
I founded my gym@@ nasi@@ um of 20 years ago .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymnas@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong health benefits as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks to Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the olymp@@ ic team gol@@ ds and thank you , you were motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance physicians would like to organize more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 senior resident doctors agreed to vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t had revealed plans to forci@@ bly introduce the Treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be detri@@ mental to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance physicians are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend essays to improve the care of the clock times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Kom@@ mit@@ tee for assistance physicians , announced last night in a message : &quot; assistance physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty , in particular that it will inc@@ ite the current workforce crisis and treat it to treat all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is running out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A for resol@@ ving disputes caused the government to take part and sometimes listen to de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had only done last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the vibration and address the concerns of the assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further action measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to provide coverage to doctors at the strike post chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better weekend pay for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS associate , urged the assistance physicians to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work campaign measures achieve nothing but only a little strain , but already burden over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , car@@ ers and their families only worries , trouble and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the Committee of the assistance physicians and responded positively to concerns about gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional retirement , training k@@ est , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it were employers , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS &apos;s regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS &apos;s regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and one quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls , which form deposits .
when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ g the flow of blood up to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g blood flow to the brain causing a stroke .
persons who have had a heart attack are subject to higher risk of having a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft Recommen@@ dation from N@@ ICE , which was published today recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Healthcare Information Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness leaves election fraud in Muslim areas flour@@ ishing
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year for the dis@@ miss@@ al of a government report on corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities wis@@ ely ignored like a devastating government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally gra@@ bs the police , election observers and town halls for ignor@@ ing evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an antagon@@ ist @-@ king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral boxes in order to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should carry out an identification card to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er only needs to name his name and address .
the report proposes not applying removable ink on a person &apos;s finger when they release their vote to prevent anyone choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to congreg@@ ational documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged from Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special election tribunal decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rah@@ man is said to have made &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation in which one person as someone else chooses .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country .
in particular , he expressed alarm on the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter election - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including leading expressions to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence has been made that pressure has been exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elders , especially communities with Pakistan or Banglades@@ hi backgrounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit letter electoral documents in order to stop &quot; harvest elections . &quot;
the report , considering Ther@@ esa May , also demands tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social welfare purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing to vote .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has released her voice to prevent anyone choosing twice .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person perform to make sure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter election .
ban that political activists edit complete let@@ tering and envel@@ opes of mail choices .
the police have the authority to set up barriers to voting stations .
a change of law , facilit@@ ated by an accus@@ ation of in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in suff@@ rage stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to make sure that the staff rule out that voters go alone in the electoral cab .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal record . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election tribunal has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ out controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the constitu@@ ent registration departments of the Town H@@ ouses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country bears a proud heritage as the Mother of the Par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous bi@@ kers from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are out of touch with the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who proved to be an impressive double @-@ decker of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only athlete with gold fighting athlete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you are allowed to believe in the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic med@@ als that feature more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ gerin on the cycling track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain bow sc@@ orer could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter , after pictures on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street star un@@ c@@ anny .
in fact , the ar@@ cher received the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see any resem@@ b@@ lance with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I &apos;ll take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking resem@@ b@@ lance between Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Harris .
Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes will be able to go through Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an as a double @-@ han@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one way higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption drama
another moderate comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett who shows similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resemble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed simil@@ arities
theory in space : according to this user , there might be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair .
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet is thinking that Hope Solo and Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and face .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at dr 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron emp@@ tied spectators of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
the Canadian channel C@@ BC had to excuse himself after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer was &quot; descending like M@@ ief &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when at the end of the 4x@@ 100m free style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron gave off his own opinions .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who had been brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old chin@@ ese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , like M@@ ief , he died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language .
E@@ mm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just say that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; is like a pig ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not captured that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ mar from China has been described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; babies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the fin@@ als 4 x 200m free style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the connection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard at which many were talking about
Twitter users didn &apos;t stop when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comments of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming capacity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate phrase , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in people responding to Twitter via Twitter
comment Mat@@ ter Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ ies in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments relate to the performance of flo@@ unders and not on them as a person .
yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate phrase . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to excuse me for the comment that I made after the women &apos;s squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the float and not to it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no dis@@ regard was inten@@ tional and I &apos;m very sorry about it . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by a woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the business
the buyers did not know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation she looked as she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and tou@@ red four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tou@@ red the under@@ pants before putting it back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she pulled herself up and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tasted them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she was just there , fre@@ ch like Osk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants which you obviously did not like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , pulled herself up and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching - or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How hard to think someone would take shelter with someone who had another person who had not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled her out and she hadn &apos;t been washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were pulled out of the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapon attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer around for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach yourself from behind , then you should turn around first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot @-@ line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the gun between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
strike it then with the knee in the l@@ ath and twist while the aggres@@ sor bent against sor@@ eness , the weapon from his hands . strike him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the gun on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technology is similar - move your body out of the shot @-@ line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot .
put the weight on the weapon at the same time and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the gun out of its grip , before they move backwards and turn the gun on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it &apos;s making Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that during a rob@@ ber@@ y it is most secure to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ uts his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ merged his immune system and the worms @-@ lex for a serious test - by le@@ aking up some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k dra@@ gged his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flush toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before dropping each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show up and show us what to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of dra@@ gging the r@@ ins@@ ing button on a tractor that has been used by thousands of others may be totally re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings at stations to washing dum@@ pling of toilets , the task posed to its immune system definitely below a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial showed a lumin@@ ometric rating of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a r@@ ussi@@ an toilet which he refused to lick up after their lumin@@ ometric number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst I have in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dir@@ tier than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , which ended up saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had asked some of the things I had instructed him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting r@@ ussi@@ an toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey carried out in 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing the added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
social housing devast@@ ated before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social home after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 , because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ on and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ figur@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were lined with holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was s@@ me@@ ared on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which the family had inflic@@ ted , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , disputes and floods .
Skel@@ on , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
old tr@@ ash was found in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances .
in the estate , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were torn
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ unded them and their partners this week by force from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily und@@ ress .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement managers of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the church building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the r@@ enter agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family because a dele@@ tion is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be horrible .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and gave us the information provided .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the dele@@ tion on the floor .
workers in the house management will now have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 the police took a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ on was fin@@ ed after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in commercial view .
she claimed that the money was for a grave stone of her son Lee Skel@@ by , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after they were homeless , it was assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ded with gra@@ ffiti .
the police say they will del@@ o@@ ge tenants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told repor@@ ters that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not obey the rules of the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal pan@@ i@@ cked after an eff@@ er@@ ves@@ cent military jet flies to the beach
sun wor@@ shi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal , experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane The Air Force carried out an incredible flight
the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that no safety risk was present
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ er@@ ves@@ cent jet crashes over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped on as they naturally began to worry about the noise of the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms , without first seeing what came on them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew extremely low twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt as if the plane fell on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro had panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
the Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and so deeply flies that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that due to the poor visibility , the jet flew somewhat deeper than usual due to the poor visibility conditions , but the air forces persist@@ ently insisted that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where there were also four people on the island Madeira to death .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to circumstances - heavy fog and smoke , which limited his view .
the plane was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise

Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
the world ranking first won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with success at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese J@@ un Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fet@@ ch the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ onna@@ ire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs , they had no coaches with them .
they had retired to the grand@@ stand and left their cont@@ actors on their own in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said .
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang with only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ pre@@ macy of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
nevertheless , there were nevertheless ample breath @-@ taking ballo@@ ons to see .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .

Donald Tr@@ ump Sp@@ ends ″ huge problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now had short@@ com@@ ings of his campaign in the previous republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the multi @-@ track and self @-@ confi@@ dently appearing multi @-@ million@@ aire vo@@ iced as little as concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
after throwing 16 ri@@ vals inside his own republi@@ can camp from the race , doubts about his success in the battle for the White House continue to grow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump told Evangel@@ ical Christians asking for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt is false reports on his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his famous media campaign .
republi@@ can strongh@@ old of the republi@@ can
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ ron from June , Tr@@ ump and his competitor were level@@ ed by the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that can be used for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the broad@@ caster CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question how to stop the advance of Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards , this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than to tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him for reasons of political correc@@ tness , this is fine , &quot; Tr@@ ump said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tr@@ ump is said to have threatened to strike funds to support his electoral campaign , he should not present any better survey values .
instead of this , the Can@@ did@@ ates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans want to intervene more strongly for Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Olympic Games : tri@@ ster Sc@@ am at D@@ oping Test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second D@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
after a fraud trial in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan bureau@@ crat had told that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , found a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ i .
this was reported to the team leader of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF speaker announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the subsequent actions of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and signed up and signed up as F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Kenya &apos;s chief de Mission , Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the ac@@ creditation of the athlete , who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ i was about 800 meters in the Beijing World Cup in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan head of the athle@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ i was dra@@ fted by the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports he allegedly was arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing agreements , the IO@@ C has been under special surveillance for a long time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , unusual first attention was made to the fact that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil , an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya has taken Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is conform to the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations have been raised again and again that in Kenya D@@ oping means are easily accessible and there is a considerable mentality of sports fraud .
last but not least , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar study in Kenya as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it has been proven that in this sport , it was widespread and systematic .
after that , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical won Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director , Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the classical temple and fulfilled with the role of Mary a youth mare .
in the orchest@@ ral pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she recalls her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says it in her song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel utter , oh so pretty , I feel Automotive &amp; wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it is clever , of course na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with it .
she is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with it .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley &apos;s &quot; West Side Story &quot; is highly topical : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as significant today as it was at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family underwent a few weeks ago from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and died shortly after her family &apos;s information to leave the country @-@ torn country and to return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls left the east of London in a plane towards Turkey and then take a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family has been told that she has married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and she became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the case of electoral victory in Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ can in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is of the opinion that the next president will ap@@ point the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;

tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazin works with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to publish a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine differs from Old@@ school play@@ boys as &quot; Play@@ boy for Men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that it does the Calendar as well .
&quot; we must return to portra@@ y timeless and classic naked , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to release the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and lo@@ dges Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of asylum seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term it might even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat by Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with a few hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already sur@@ passed Kurdish strongh@@ olds for months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing in Turkey .
after the fro@@ sty coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would come to an end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start new in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state capable of picking up refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Association compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic towns .
in this way Erdo@@ gan hopes to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were eradic@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of the Association demanded that the federal government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics is held . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and lo@@ dges Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and secular groups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as reported by the newspaper , relying on figures by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks , before the coup , presented the largest group of asylum entitled to asylum in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this had been 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all recognised as eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey not those of war , poverty or lack of perspective can be found .
asylum seekers after the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia should not vote for the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
2021 will not again take place directly at the end of summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for more stupid as so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land election campaigns - that &apos;s the bite .
the locals , who are supposed to be convinced by the poll@@ s , are on holiday .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on the shores of U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so don &apos;t choose the day of the day .
there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , spread fl@@ yers and end up counting , just drive them lab@@ ori@@ ously .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and final holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass an election campaign on the people over itself .
the hot phase , when you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
what is exciting is how much new@@ bie Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition du@@ sting .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a bit with the people , just as he did his legendary wor@@ thier Harald Ring@@ storff also .
otherwise , Se@@ ering has got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel bears the blame for the Af@@ D &apos;s blo@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will now cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is if you make electoral campaigns at the right time at the right time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Angela Merkel has twice invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to make major discoveries ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group was not right , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , according to Kok@@ ert , only plays a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that in the country you have to take the base to find a way to get a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are , like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any available in the vast@@ ness of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the advice of the CD@@ U chan@@ cell@@ or Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats , last with 22 per cent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election 2011 , the SPD had clearly gained 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are expected to make the leap into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern virtue out of their holidays and largely transfer their campaign to the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calls it the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green campaig@@ ners go on search for local voters among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just curves with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and also finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is san@@ iti@@ zed , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which starts at 5.@@ 30@@ am and only end at about 20 o &apos;clock , there are always praise .
&quot; they did everything quite fine , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready .
in addition , the receipt of the responsible for the construction works is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the installation of nec@@ c@@ ess@@ ary trips .
since the construction site has been reloc@@ ated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen been lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has been revers@@ ed , the traffic situation within the resort has eased .
citizens can now turn from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen back on both sides from the B 27 .
the ev@@ asive travel through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy chief conductor , Florian King , responsible for the project traffic management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise as many sne@@ akers were looking for and more familiar with their navigation system than the sig@@ nage .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fr@@ ying in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the congregation lifted the car from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation .
two to three per minute have already been b@@ anded .
the fastest speed was 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , it has become cal@@ mer .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that the street is open for customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation has led to sales breaks with them lets everyone who is asked can look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are therefore produced for other companies , for whom the restoration hardly has consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even at deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also acknow@@ le@@ dges that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most bag@@ ged places are the local restaurants along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly a crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only it , but all the restaurants have &quot; hit hard . &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must be happy about every euro turnover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refurbish@@ ment of the streets prevented its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must have dismissed half of his collabor@@ ators .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the advice given that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now , it must also bear the disadvantages inherent in the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where things get more spacious .
in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , referring to the long history .
it can be understood that other regul@@ ars are now less frequently passing by because of complicated traffic guidance .
if you can &apos;t ride , it is also somewhere else nice .
that his pedi@@ gree is coming back at the end of the renovation works , there is no doubt that G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises of BSE and avi@@ an influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis he has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the time , laws are scre@@ wed in the name of the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the latest attacks , the Minister of the Interior , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , now sets out a thick security package .
but what does a tolerance status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Recon@@ c@@ iler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not over@@ charge anybody .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I was also involved in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , however , he was at the results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère fell short of time before presenting his conclusions for the safety of the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some are already known , announced , filed : that a new security agency should take care of the attacks of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on air passenger data and tru@@ ce legislation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère will start a second run for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to raise sympathy for terrorist groups and knock down jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U acknow@@ le@@ dges . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still believes this to be reasonable and demands nothing , which is not a chance for the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas are presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they partly have it in themselves : he plans fast procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for detention before deportation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in case of toler@@ ations for expi@@ red asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than so far - about those who commit crimes or intentionally throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are politically and legally prec@@ lu@@ ded .
some things have an effect even more incomplete and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of people , for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be argued that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees .
and things that people pro@@ found@@ ly dealt with could not be cl@@ en@@ ched even in electoral times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly moving into position on the topic of internal security .
in the past few days , between the two parties it was very high .
only a gar@@ ris@@ tic dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the resort leaders also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also struggles for con@@ cili@@ atory notes .
he does nothing of a departure from the double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to do something new , don &apos;t make sense .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether his own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; is for the coalition partner , has yet to show itself .
there is a lot in it , which could cause controversy .
but the SPD is currently attempting to profile itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel clearly sign@@ alizes the readiness for conversation and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still able to get off lightly .
despite diesel engines , delivery volumes are increasing worldwide .
but it does not run around in all markets .
in the recall action , there is vor@@ tices around a term .
Volkswagen starts sub@@ trac@@ ting deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite the diesel aff@@ ici@@ aries , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer is able to further advance a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July the core brand VW was weak@@ ening mainly in Western Europe and again bur@@ dened total sales , such as the company listed in the Da@@ x .
in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars worldwide to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China alone , sales were 14 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries dropped by almost a sixth .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , head of the market , led the weaker figures from July , mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there was a reluct@@ ance to buy back in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU also bur@@ dened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the exhaust gases first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus sign .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the primarily affected domestic brand of Lower Saxony already got off lightly due to the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is recorded .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales bonus from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen has been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust test .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW insisted that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output .
after the retro@@ fitting , the car manufacturer issued a &quot; guarantee &quot; certification , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was said on Friday in company circles .
the reason is legal refin@@ ements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now granted its German customers a guarantee of re @-@ equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there was such a meeting .
&quot; VW has to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that in the case of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after retro@@ fitting no deterior@@ ations take place and all types of approved vehicle parameters remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was said in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers to come to a workshop for example half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
in the case of customer interest , it is also important to avoid that any other damage , which has nothing to do with the approval scandal , is to be in@@ secure with respect to possible guarantees of warranty as it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from wealthy savers in future pen@@ alties - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank principal Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher Banken talks about an individual case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would not have to fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for its austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depos@@ iting banks overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay its 0.@@ 4 percent penalty interest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fee will charge the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September from private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros to sight deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100.000 euro are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 euros will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time now , he kept 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day on the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost is now continuing .
leaving the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank counters would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few were mig@@ rating to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to carry you alone is &quot; economically not possible in the long term . &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land has made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , head of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele whose wealth is more luxuri@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bench &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
before you rush to the comment section , to sow him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym of non @-@ Al@@ le@@ One male @-@ female middle @-@ aged with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re @-@ emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ m collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers prefer their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs 66 % ) .
but the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wear a modest gray suit and fer@@ ment wild@@ ly before I stop , hold my hands and say something sprin@@ kling like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent vendors were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I run from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records .
these records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his dispos@@ able income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy when they appeared and once again buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 1960s , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he hits will apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noted a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records .
from the conversations I &apos;ve conducted , people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom of fans of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop such as Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z some of the older customers took part in the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some fans of the record feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers , of objects that call up happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector , and I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff from a record pile wi@@ pes out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have record players .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smoo@@ then through a stack of bos@@ sa nova come comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone recently came in here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own record players , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead sound record so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a large percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ friendly , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have record players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not the older ones , who come in only slowly .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience when I go in .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who take photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest synthes@@ izer and sexually @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz , is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but obvious psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it rather makes a window stroll as a big purchase .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I am preten@@ ding to have a pair of jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records .
even though my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , don &apos;t take into account the large number of female collectors that exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their th@@ ur@@ sday morning with security with the stroll through the shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ring look of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who worries about the shoulders of uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects proposal on demoli@@ tion of deals in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial hearing this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which people within the camp offer goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be demoli@@ shed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would involve a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups told the court that businesses and restaurants were important as free meals offered by the state @-@ backed Association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also argued that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a L@@ ille court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely trace@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the ra@@ ind@@ rops was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is non @-@ serving and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as providing advice on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees living in the jungle camp increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympics @-@ disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his disap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic period , Rad@@ resour@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to stop .
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight ahead , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro in Facebook .
he does not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly don &apos;t think it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s travel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyse in peace , which reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World Cup in October in Qatar Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we &apos;ve changed lately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the triple @-@ time World Race World Champion , who lost more than three minutes on the 5@@ 4.5 km Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

watching other people playing video games is a giant thing - Microsoft also wants to profit from it .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which special@@ ises in this hobby .
Microsoft did not share how much money to take over the acquisition on Thursday .
Be@@ am came to the start with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give players up missions and contrast enemies as well as provide equipment .
the Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard player starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed meters : new flas@@ hes of lightning are being tested in various federal states , including Hessen and Brandenburg , which are intended to be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement tra@@ ilers of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , on accidents , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabili@@ t@@ ating bridges with temporary speed poles , there is often no need for infrastructure to provide a stationary flash for compliance with speed limits .
a durable mobile construction can however be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement operation ; the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology can also detect all vehicles across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as transit access by time , passenger strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ run condition , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measurement operation so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also sweat @-@ proof outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the lightning from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also being used .
also foreign authorities are flas@@ hing with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 copies last year .
UK catching silver in 7 @-@ day ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ day ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o stage .
Fi@@ ji has given a master class in the handling , side st@@ eppe , back , line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day , could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji could have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for the UK - but it won &apos;t be - that at least a Brit@@ on will have a gold medal on his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago , under Ryan , she lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this stage will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonder@@ full and had the attacks of G@@ Bs pr@@ un@@ ing out of fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. to run into driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au hat@@ ched in the corner .
with only four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he changed .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a Mit@@ ch@@ ell ho@@ ist@@ ing torch stopped the mount of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but Fi@@ ji stopped only .
in the seventh minute Ath@@ j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua left a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for the UK .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ started and there was still more than a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med down to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning .
this is how it is .
GB introduced basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic vulner@@ ability ... for all four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for the GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sul@@ tan , whose fans sang , fli@@ r@@ ting flags and dancing on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle rang , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged themselves and GB cr@@ ut@@ ched cr@@ un@@ ched into the grass .
in the past , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a small semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for a stroke win
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inal gold than in these games and that will mean something .
from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 Hard H@@ ieve , who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when she ru@@ d@@ led the second Olympic team in a row without a star@@ board , the first women in the history of British sports who placed such a standard .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , at least their 3@@ 9th un@@ defeated use , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant athletes who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph .
behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who did not know if he was diagnosed with cancer before 30 months ago .
as he said , he is ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you don &apos;t do this , he spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had been lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , off the season , which kept the break to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was hospit@@ alized and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ irrit@@ ating morning talking about anything else than otherwise , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning who was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s maybe something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person to train or have a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not win a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very trapped in the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not eager to do something great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple will take a time out for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
it took about six months in London to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary care provided for 31 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ wide exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water utility association as model for large water producers .
thus , some time ago , the original one was named in a contribution by the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia praised the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ wide as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was in the association office for 31 years , 28 years as Managing Director .
he was now reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the municipal drinking water association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , Municip@@ ality of Breit@@ brunn , supports approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 towns and pastures with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the congreg@@ ations are church lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
the current Chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller had been appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed General Manager of the European Union in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his duties have been very varied and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work on office and organizational tasks , budget@@ ary creation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and repar@@ ation of the farmers , the renovation of the high reservoir ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial re@@ modelling of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and there have always been innovations , because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and accurate service over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has literally lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was able to present the recipe for success of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group on nit@@ rate reduction prior to the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for that he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brun@@ nen@@ bau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the restructuring of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zw@@ eck@@ verband &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as high points from its point of view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult task was the rup@@ ture of the tu@@ b@@ ular at church lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brunn too , because one filled the high can@@ ister of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the association of drinking water was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something two years ago , when I sang at La Scala in Milan , he re@@ members nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - a man shooting at risk of life
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) and injured them mort@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man inv@@ oked and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator is on the run , and after him , I will be publicly gro@@ unded .
meanwhile , because Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is about 1.80 meters large , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a g@@ oth .
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
in the meantime , the man we@@ ars a lat@@ ch .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the gun , so the police .
those who see Sven S. will call the 110 .
the police talks about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to make any statements about the dew or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say any more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
STAHL - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in the millions .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from green power generation are from the table .
it remains at the liberation of the Renew@@ able Energy Transi@@ tion in the existing plants for the so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , said German Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German General Newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , open day edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with competition commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works trap an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but this too will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on self @-@ electricity production .
so the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry have particular significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation intensified , when the world &apos;s largest producer of products threw steel on the world market in light of the weak domestic demand .
European manufacturers accused Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import st@@ ole effects , on the other hand , the economic outlook grew up in China .
it is not clear how sustainable the price @-@ picking is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
la@@ stly , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted to avoid closing individual works .
around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious in spite of rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Division distributed steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced quantity went back in succession for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association expects an improved order situation in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her whole life as a young girl . as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s degree she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 year old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
after all , singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Senior league .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , H@@ ac@@ kler describes .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
social and family structures often dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
in doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand their lungs will not get out of their everyday routine as quickly as they are in everyday life .
also when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an ideal hobby .
on older people singing often has a very special effect , &quot; says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der senior @-@ Organisationen .
in the older generations shared singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that the singing or hearing of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ cent@@ red people are de@@ pressed for long @-@ lying events .
in singing , a special performance is required for the head , L@@ enz explains .
to concentrate simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the feeling of self @-@ esteem increases by singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I do long for something , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are enough reasons to start singing .
whoever wants to try out a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , says L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior chorus , one can easily join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can direct themselves directly to the church or church leaders .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found over the Internet .
anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males to scre@@ am of kit@@ tens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover which effect the cre@@ eping of kit@@ tens on adult animals has .
to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also left the males not cold - however , they always beha@@ ved identical in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al degree of kit@@ tens in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they react by 10 percent faster on caus@@ tic sounds that are in great need , such as scientists from the Veter@@ inary Academy and Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of kit@@ tens - but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently the acoustic differences between mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young for the males are either un@@ noticeable or not of significance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of M@@ H@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ ten scre@@ ams differs with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy .
a total of nine adult males and eight female babies from the livestock hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H were observed .
they were played for a pack of little ones , taken from the throw box for three minutes and separated from both mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited kit@@ tens , who were raised in addition .
despite the small sample for meaningful results , the researchers maintain their results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who have not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the cries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speakers if this rep@@ ut@@ ation of the very excited kit@@ tens played .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males did not react at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , whether they were mothers or not , reported the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ gen is a legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ yer .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important soccer game takes place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ed ri@@ vals between Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even with the suspension of the state of emergency after the crash test in July , the government did not hesitate to interfere with the everyday life of normal citizens .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
football does not stop before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former heavy @-@ man Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ det .
according to this , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ley@@ r is said to be a follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , actually this has no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country declared that Erdo@@ gan has declared its end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the K@@ ik@@ tas &apos; club are traditionally not counted among the president &apos;s friends .
what unites the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict denial of military put@@ sch .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at Po@@ kal@@ zi@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially returned to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the Cologne in the past season proved its athle@@ tic value : with 17 fo@@ ols and nine designs in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as the top@@ sc@@ orer of his club .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory figure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disap@@ pointing season for the record champion was an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say good @-@ bye also in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South by Li@@ g , it was only rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we did it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year progres@@ sed better .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season ap@@ points as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ Protect @-@ King .
this is also the reason that the fans hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the same time , the only loan granted by the AC @-@ Florence and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas had been announced after the attempted coup attempt , not to return to the country after its EM @-@ holidays due to the political situation in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the storm would have to be willing to wai@@ ve roughly one @-@ third of his estimated 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympic in Rio
34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can laugh at them only - they fight med@@ als in Rio .
dop@@ ing is still the head@@ line at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who , after a dop@@ ing spar@@ row , compla@@ ined about her starting law before the games , was stri@@ k@@ ingly plu@@ cked out and boo@@ ed at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) .
there was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery : she was still in the hall with an open smile and prov@@ oked her performance .
when it became clear that she would not get gold , the audience broke out into a storm of applause .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite D@@ oping &apos;s past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked twice for dop@@ ing twice ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before . he is the number one in the world more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven times world champion had to take a six @-@ month lock after she was proven to take the pain medication Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after surgery , she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European Championship was tested positive for the banned stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the oral in@@ gest@@ ing and was blocked six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of the big gold favorite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion more than 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement would have been responsible , bet@@ tered Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ fest , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete has been recognised as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after having found testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title 2006 due to testosterone abuse .
the bronze medal from the 2008 Olympic Games was also recognised as a result of a verdict of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record chan@@ cell@@ or and gold favourite was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championships there were indications of taking a forbidden dietary supplement , the barrier of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell off and ran off on July 13 .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans injured - Sever@@ al dead@@ men
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , the spokesperson of the State Department , Thomas Sch@@ nö@@ ll , said Friday early .
she suffered from cuts and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already left it again .
she planned her return home for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on also Austrian citizens are still unclear .
in this regard , the State Department is in constant contact with local authorities , so Sch@@ nö@@ ll .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , explo@@ ded at first on Thursday evening in a life quarter of two bombs .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two explosive devices went up again , another man was killed according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured during the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach of Pat@@ ong popular with tourists .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing a city cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the demoli@@ tion went into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police .
after all , there were several injured det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to comment on possible motives - but probably the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks , typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist rebellion or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , restricted to restricted areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
over the past few days , the authorities would have received secret information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact date and places .
it is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks .
the police ordered their officials throughout the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly do not judge tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the present bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need to travel to these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this ad@@ mits to the military major influence in the coming years as well .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country was moving towards stability , improving economic conditions and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which in 2014 had seized power after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ members the kingdom to restore stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the insur@@ gency of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok in a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several country offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the federal government have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see in the &apos; identical movement &apos; indications of aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group CEO Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ dine at the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in a extrem@@ ist manner .
that is why we are now observing the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ alism , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - the &quot; identical ones &quot; are already observ@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ma@@ dine said that his authority was closely aligned with the regional offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language often with pop music .
that is what Islam@@ ists do as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an adverti@@ sed advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible to attack .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there have been reports of contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that he had no knowledge of that .
for constitutional protection , possible Cont@@ acts of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the significant increase of right @-@ to @-@ right crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , Ma@@ dine said he would not speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that further right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee trage@@ dies or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a German @-@ wide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
he expressed concern that many violations were made on the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying phenomenon .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum seekers had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , perhaps politically in@@ different or elected for example , the CD@@ U , the SPD or the Left , which , however , have radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic Games or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ ré at the Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cli@@ pping was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ la then became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his lead with a return of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 runners .
but it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that drew the attention of the international media .
why is the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participating in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special rigid law from the International Swimming Federation .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries better known .
because in Ethiopia , most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ la just wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the lap very fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ uble of the whale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; referring to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welfare state &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter open style , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i ran for media attention at the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000 .
unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete on his own for a 100 meter free race .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump doesn &apos;t look so close to the lo@@ oming election defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks on an election campaign in Florida .
should there be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has an alternative video .
he then drove to the holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end it will either fold or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV station CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him for reasons of political correc@@ tness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
so he called US President Barack Obama and the democr@@ ats candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party , there was more and more resistance .
post rises in trade with electric vans
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is apparently large .
the mail plans to sell her electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter as well .
the Group plans to start trading with the transpor@@ ter shortly .
the next year , the postal service aims to offer its electric vans on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to go on sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they want to sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered to other companies .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always re @-@ en@@ quiries , such as tra@@ des@@ men .
according to the news magazine Der Spiegel , the Bonn @-@ based company intends soon to enter the mass production of vehicles .
in the post @-@ own fabri@@ cation , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and , in the long term , made a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we will change the complete fleet .

Marktanalyse - C@@ anned / Pres@@ er@@ ved Food in Brazil Euro@@ monitor
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the entries suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research firm Gf@@ K made it clear that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more in@@ secure , the longer the success he has promised .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research firm Gf@@ K : once again disap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the company management , the worldwide number five in the industry is facing a personnel new beginning .
the CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , already has its effect on the Supervisory Board with effect on 12 September .
as early as 1 September , the management of the board of directors takes over the previous member of the board of directors , Gerhard Haus@@ rü@@ inger , divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor has been found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a reason for the resignation , the company called &quot; different views &quot; on the long @-@ term business policy orientation .
details did not want to name a company speaker on Friday .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in connection with investors , it was said on Friday that shareholders recently had a big disappointment on the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago .
since 2011 , Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last heavy fi@@ ber@@ glass business figures , any shareholders will eventually be rest@@ less at some point .
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; he said .
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , revenue was 6.1 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in terms of the first half @-@ year , revenue shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent at EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million .
the profit in the second quarter was above all bur@@ dened by the lower value of the company in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the company value amor@@ tization of 139 million euros , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , posted a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K generated net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides in c@@ umm@@ ho@@ s in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
in the event of an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ umm@@ ho@@ ern ( district of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , the police announced .
according to her specifications , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach re@@ port@@ edly had to ev@@ ade a truck that was part of the counter track .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Wit@@ t@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people were unable to leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the accident scene on the state road 2 .
the last travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ umm@@ ho@@ und district of P@@ ew@@ all .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the tour company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report themselves to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste water will take place from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh , 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will be increased once again , if appropriate improvements are necessary .
after an over@@ ly slu@@ gg@@ ish calculation , the sewage at Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household by the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , Kul@@ mb@@ ach was established that for these wastewater facilities there were overl@@ app@@ ings .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants at a cost @-@ covering basis .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial enterprises from Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg have to take deeper into the pur@@ se .
revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt displayed the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation can be compensated .
Schmidt explained that in all three sewage installations there were relatively small facilities with a very low drainage system , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
thus , due to the low distribution base , for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing .
furthermore , due to their age , refurbish@@ ment and repair expenses were not least due to the age of refurbish@@ ment and repair in all three systems .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years .
Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the waste water plant in Az@@ endorf as a result of damage .
in the Wel@@ sh pump station , the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and , after nearly 20 years of operation , the first clari@@ fication pond had to be excav@@ ated , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation can be installed to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses were the amor@@ tis@@ ation and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in line with the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 were still clearly below the current level .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of a small waste water attack in the three plants , the costs for operation and maintenance were &quot; fully exploited . &quot;
in the past 20 years , Schmidt explained that the market community has been spar@@ ed from major maintenance costs for wastewater facilities in the past 20 years .
according to stone houses , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned facilities will remain prec@@ arious , especially as the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater utility company cannot be extended by these facilities because it is a deficit @-@ bearing institution .
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; Restaurants and Hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell on clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critici@@ zed as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ unt , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps get to the public .
in the past , Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have attracted criticism in which they were accused of promoting the app Black@@ face conve@@ yed or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when it suggested a filter to some users this week , which gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wondered whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage was widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat told that it had disabled the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was thought to be a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders , who experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widely used across the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and uns@@ atis@@ factory . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the confrontation of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the descending lim@@ b .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural mine .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats &apos;s great audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could expect to expect sensitivity more likely .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for media and in a telephone interview she said that she believes rac@@ er @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the majority of white male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures for the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokesperson , the company recently recru@@ ited a HR officer focusing on sub@@ ver@@ sive population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will shut down her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military Leadership Sk@@ ills IS@@ IS Secret Service Information , Con@@ clu@@ des Con@@ gres@@ sional Committee
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence @-@ based information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than would have allowed the actual conditions on site reported in a Thursday report .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Army Commit@@ tees , Secret Service Commit@@ tees , and the Ar@@ ms budget Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence @-@ based information , typically pat@@ ched by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism , as the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ Com reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts felt exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com Affili@@ ate announced publicly that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s tips changed the intelligence reports to shut down the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are under way by the General In@@ spector of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the high @-@ ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Committee of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensated the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was insufficient room for diver@@ ging opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats claimed to have found no evidence of a White House intervention in Cent@@ Com analysts concerning &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon inspec@@ tor who received complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the reports of the Congress while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ torate were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the issue of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes over more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , according to government authorities , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , they had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US wins fourth match in women &apos;s field @-@ hockey , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before
one day after firing three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she couldn &apos;t remember anything ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , she knows that the American women lie at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons at first place , who after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan are unbe@@ aten .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place in their group from six teams each .
the first placed will take the strong Dutch some time out of the way leading the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising fuss about their success story , four years after they ended up in the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years a hockey club ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National act@@ ress of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics as she couldn &apos;t qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , became the coach of the national team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work package in London we now have .
we have the ru@@ dder to be able to tear it all around .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area .
India was without a win in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game in their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball on the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and drew the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament to be the goal keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs , who so far had to pay a goal in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the rage of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the Rio de Janeiro events are constantly and in@@ escap@@ able , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick , which is passed by the w@@ rist@@ guard to a swi@@ mmer to a gym@@ n@@ ast to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the queu@@ es in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the conflict between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s s@@ warm with dim@@ ples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names that would be sent to Prime Time , by sponsor and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a swi@@ mmer , Tur@@ ner or even F@@ echter .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is competing in gold .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partially in the shadow are the sports which are not generally accepted : pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the swimming pool and may it reign for a long time .
but if I would like to make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw your attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so scar@@ ce that many of them , I had questioned , did not know that it was at all an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans who are for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain exterior charm , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a dealer .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending pop @-@ up - but also the gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and scuba diving , the two sports which essentially unite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means so much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rising vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , hal@@ ves and balances ) before they land on their feet .
they will be judged according to the official Olympic program according to specification , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olymp@@ ian v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to go farther in their pursuit of gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes down and back , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the pre@@ text , but also another highlight in the television broadcast : the world or the Olympic Games .
the purpos@@ eful aspir@@ ation is pos@@ h , admi@@ rable , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel a bit ti@@ ring even when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly upwards again .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time , which the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days starting at 2 : 00 p.m .
in the midst of the Olympics , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner suggested recently according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to breathe .
&quot; a Generation Prot@@ ects &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia backed the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed while colli@@ ding with the police .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
in the last ten years it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast @-@ growing economy .
but in the past few months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was mer@@ cil@@ ess .
witnesses stated that police shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
circul@@ ating videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council demands a detailed investigation now .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror @-@ driven countries , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued to supp@@ ress oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was constra@@ ined , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you supp@@ ress people and have no other options to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the governing coalition .
following a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea are increasing ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line prompted hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ des , which have been enforced more or less in recent years , will exploit the turbul@@ ence and be able to arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of exposure to the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first appears harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and Internet services improved .
even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians issued that they were so much prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ fort@@ as , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s mainly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economics , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but even that is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ res@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , the secret services , commerce and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 .
he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special orders to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the North Ethiop@@ ian Tiger Region , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar was in 2005 after thousands prot@@ esting against elections which , according to analysts , were apparently le@@ ashed by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ra@@ ids that followed , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were fewer than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty allevi@@ ation .
but it was obvious that this did not prevent the Ethiop@@ ian government &apos;s internal dis@@ miss@@ al .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a Thai town , attacked by Tig@@ ray and hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the base for d@@ ron@@ ging flights over neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its allies to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his claim to Obama founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multi @-@ repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raises new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings together his fellow @-@ workers , who endeav@@ our to take protection during an event @-@ rich period , into the peculiar position to explain statements that he does not mean at all .
having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump broke back with regard to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation totally serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help him weak@@ en the statement by rec@@ alling that Mr Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know none of it .
the last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to cas@@ u@@ alties .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton maintained speeches on the Mich@@ igan economic situation this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
on Twitter , he warned that Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he raised strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he declared &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ age enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ bor@@ ated tone since its survey values have declined .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was released on Friday , showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to not excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he frequently accused his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ leading his humor .
but while rein@@ forcing the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps have brought down his loyal comrades to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , made great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked to the correc@@ tness of Mr. Tr@@ umps claims whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ benches , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread itself by allowing it to take control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of ro@@ cking on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats s@@ coff@@ ed at Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ologies as just another evidence that he was in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
once crowded at the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
verb Cafe was a big@@ gy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash that was not Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices came out of its Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s shop , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people claimed it as a final loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap store . &quot;
but if New York is a change it is also a new invention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing associate of the old café , owner and managing director of the new coffee bar .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a client offered to provide funds for a new out@@ shell , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ nish@@ ing like cap@@ ers and aci@@ dic onions .
there are natural disasters .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed out by awards from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the verb on a regular basis .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee drinking a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that it was in the coffee and culture in the verb I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended ch@@ ai tea instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long@@ time and loyal customer .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment on the fact that the soap store occupied the old business area .
in fact , the owner of the soap cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for the verb with the coffee of coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new client has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has preten@@ ded to post them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local saffron bar wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ fried coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the floor when the cafe closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his as@@ cen@@ sion to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as foo@@ dies , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for sophisticated del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen on Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu this day was a bit more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es Last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA while Ziegel@@ man in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; talked about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food @-@ perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , local snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in store since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Ziegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the repor@@ tage ordered h@@ acking , this found the couple fitting for a discussion of the food in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut @-@ bread , lo@@ af @-@ cheese and bean @-@ bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts as they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years prior to the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ buffet .
teams of women cook for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving European during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; records the paths with which the country turned out to be no longer the land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for Americans became a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
unique mix@@ tures were tried out , as a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction was preced@@ ed by taste or even healthy kitchen@@ ware .
while resear@@ ching the book , which includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home reception recipes .
as never before or ever , domestic econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - attacked the eating habits of the country .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household women &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ h@@ lets like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies .
particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to the star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ dollar man from the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was delight@@ fully realistic .
President Roosev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the attitude of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors brought by Ms. Roosev@@ elt that the White House produced the most te@@ di@@ ous food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to its feet .
the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man reminded her : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind bag incident .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosev@@ elt did eat at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and added that it was a bad trick to pass a simple name to modest recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone seemed reluct@@ ant to use a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown sm@@ b@@ ber .
aston@@ ish@@ ingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E won three times a follow @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few hack@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything in order to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bomb attack on Assad &apos;s regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group , who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 lives so far .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives at the stake in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant , showing him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he never saw himself as a hero , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die trying to save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters cast four barrel bombs above the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous remnants of the bomb so that children can &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb in the Assad regime was supposed to hit terrorists .

he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks get offspring only with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms alongside the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it counts , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal speeds up to a full 2.@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle shaped by slow@@ ness seems to be a recipe for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland hai who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland @-@ ha@@ i@@ arks become stone @-@ old for a long time .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter at the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
her slow @-@ motion was her , when she made six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
prey do this sh@@ arks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for car@@ c@@ asses that tor@@ eal from higher water layers .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest Ha@@ i was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re was measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the l@@ enti@@ l core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this center of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are not renewed again later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ l core .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons investigate larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the l@@ enti@@ ls contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons . in 2012 it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday .
all the larger Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their l@@ enti@@ ls , which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , while the record @-@ Ha@@ i with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res should be even 3@@ 92 years old .
the fact that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such methane dial@@ ects live mainly in icy waters .
also the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , in whose bacon on the neck stuck a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on tip was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs into spar@@ rows .
so they ri@@ pen later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources more in a long life .
building site in double pack
in the recent meeting , the Municipal Council has focused on topics related to building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Panel expressed the message of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and development issues were cleared and the applications could be surve@@ yed , there is nothing more in the way for the sale of plots in the residential areas of &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) to interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the rural areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau will appeal to young families and former sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , building volunteers can now report themselves in the town hall . the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting .
the municipal council decided to change the land use plan in some areas only in the spring of this year .
thus , in the section Unter@@ tempor@@ Ã n , the designated industrial area is extended by two par@@ c@@ els in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
accordingly , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will most benefit from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Property Markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether banks will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , approval in the UK is sufficient .
they are using large US banks .
several banks have already announced that they will shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance policy E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk group ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg conce@@ als a large fund sector , but as well as Dublin deterior@@ ates in its infrastructure .
thanks to the airport , Frankfurt is much easier to achieve .
further points are the city with readily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are also 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city ranks seventh , Luxemburg to No. 19 , Dublin at 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his already strong position as a financial centre for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my business researchers .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead Rec@@ ei@@ ves Legal Co@@ sts From Hepatitis C Patent Dis@@ pute with Mer@@ ck
a US Federal Ju@@ dge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs resulting from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was freed from a claim for damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , associated with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ in@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ dering and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the law@@ suit was collected on Thursday , US officials at Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead was entitled to the expense incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to merge with Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medication , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck en@@ cro@@ ach each other and claim ownership on laboratory work , which sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir underlying , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters have left the city , a spokesman for the group on Friday said .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) scra@@ m@@ ble after the departure of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city , currently the city .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are currently undertaking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cleaning up &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published her tax return on Friday for 2015 , resulting in the US presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clinton donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former Secretary of State Bill Clinton had an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book of office in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s Candi@@ date for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Senator Tim Emperor from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations for the past ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; reported Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jenni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind incorrect pron@@ oun@@ cements and re@@ trac@@ ts regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit by tax authorities as the reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the Democrats &apos; presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump@@ et Special Advis@@ or , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release anything before tax checks are not complete .
critics , including the republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business models and various other links , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed onto the subject and published on Friday a video on the Internet in which high @-@ ranking Rep@@ ublic@@ ans Tr@@ ump asked him to release his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke about the topic during a speech on the business in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a provision named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure that individuals pay the more than USD 1 million make a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here , Tr@@ ump to meet a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of the IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , average an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s tax return showed that the US only referred to USD 100 as a wage , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pads , fire@@ work bodies promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to settlements in humans - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ es .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea already years ago , has intensified funding together with U.S. Nature Conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non@@ violent , four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the World tel@@ eph@@ on day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , making them much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without harm to the elephant , &quot; the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell said in a message .
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned down to the ignition cord .
when ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom fla@@ ked with a knob and spra@@ yed fine dust on the air .
a touch is usually already enough to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one final possibility is a thro@@ wer who shoots a gold @-@ turning fire@@ works in the air and causes a loud , bright explosion . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed situation on the shores of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director sm@@ ashes the Berlin hotel because Israeli di@@ alling was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media revolt after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin has not listed an Israeli pres@@ election since it would have claimed Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s list of countries .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and extingu@@ ished ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call centre .
after searching for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cks him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind this was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have asked for the election to be extingu@@ ished , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this chain of hotels is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet , in which people called the whole thing a scandal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some highlighted the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged invitations of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the clas@@ sy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adds that the country code has been added .
police deplo@@ ys tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , together with the police when they met to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the fact that the police deployed rubber floors and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants were seen gra@@ ffiti against the preliminary president , Michel Tem@@ er , on walls .
the recent protests took place several days after prot@@ esters in crowds went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly , the ambassador said .
Russian companies have established connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representation gave some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which affects the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses sought : beverage market falling into Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y was carried out on Thursday evening on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces from the staff of the drink em@@ ark@@ et demanded the return of cash and then fled first to foot and then probably with a silver colored VW @-@ Golf .
the police did not share how much money was exploited .
the perpetrators are supposed to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the assault , the perpetrators are forced to travel towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel car park located opposite the car park entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who made observations at the time of the Tat@@ too ( at 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police .

the children and young people of the social @-@ pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection association Nag@@ old spent eight beautiful and happy days with their car@@ egi@@ vers on their summer holidays in Nuss@@ dorf near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ loving group was lod@@ ged during the first week of school in the quiet part of the holiday house Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle .
several full day tours were on the programme .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ oul@@ der with the visit of the mat@@ z@@ oos .
on the other , after Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Celtic Museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group enjoyed themselves in the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing .
children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ prepared body dishes such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled .

ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , St. Anna , were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage to Freiburg .
together , four stages were met .
in order to bridge the period up to the next Rom@@ u@@ stran@@ t pilgrimage in two years , the Federal Council of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage .
different pilgrimage destinations have been examined and one finally decided for the Epis@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgri@@ m &apos;s destination was offered at the Freiburg cathedral .
16 min@@ is of Bit@@ tel@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Heiligen@@ bad@@ gers , went their way .
in the evening , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and gave the pilgrims a blessing .
from Hor@@ b we went by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster of Our Lady stands and thus the pilgrimage route from Münster was started .
the individual day tours were framed by a short pulse with different prayers , songs and written texts in the mor@@ nings and evenings .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is crossed field@@ bus , chap@@ els or churches again and again to sing a song from specially assembled pilgrims song booklet .
for the overnight stays , each parish church of the local parish was available .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty and star@@ chy dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we passed Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next day we went to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but had to break down some 500 metres altitude at the heat of the heat and then climbed again afterwards .
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the bathroom in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg &apos;s final stage .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy .
with a small impulse , God was given thanks .
the Min@@ is visited by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed at the evening Mass in Münster .

the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took up the anch@@ or@@ age , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . the legend hau@@ led the legend when he stor@@ med home to win a win from New Zealand &apos;s favor@@ ites .
four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y scored the fifth of six Olympic gold med@@ als .
they repeated the trick of taking a modest sixth place in the course of the World Championships in London in spite of the resignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Green .
they did so in good time as an exec@@ ution@@ er .
Mr &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner won an Olympic Champion in the qualification rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ des fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which execution went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inners to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they got onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a flat@@ tering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we placed an Olympic Champion in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ ds admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags at the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win at the Olympics again .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y , who was born just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly sacred date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .

Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Sprint which starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record winner in London 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had argued in front of the qualification yesterday when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow and ended , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on his strong team of train teams to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to take a pair of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
dra@@ mas performed in the background , as the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton res@@ ig@@ ns in April amidst Sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ dic@@ ts as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary call G@@ Bs , which reached its climax at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
the future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the abolition of the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract , thereby raising all delivery contracts , as the supplying energy company has announced .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision at the beginning of this year to grant no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy defined for 20 years is exp@@ iring in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt consume about 10 percent of the total power generation of Vic@@ tori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium mel@@ ei with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three more owners announced their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which represents another physical demand for electricity through the melting plant , &quot; the company announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continues to say that the contracts are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point , AG@@ S assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on the earnings on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by forecasts from the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already depreci@@ ated the value of the contracts in its annual sum of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of dis@@ miss@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not compromise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it completed a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still a statement guilty of why it res@@ igned from the Treaty .
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt mill in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
referring to the analysts &quot; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts per year to consume about 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity per year .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans . Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted seventh edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der , ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
disclosure of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , critical reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z on@@ c@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ re ) , which ends with a classic turn : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the stere@@ otyp@@ ed action of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ aste brought the sentence &quot; you thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ onist on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girl take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an began with certainty .
K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim likes her beat the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold issue of the year for vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles an image band rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the disclosure of his cover star is anticipated so eag@@ erly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leak before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jenni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner - who is described as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - under the previous category - is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or teenagers today who know how to make a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even though everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers success doesn &apos;t like success to everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion has always been a bit ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ oes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were again high when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but riding around on the mis@@ fortune seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ ming of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell images of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the LOVE magazine .
and in her free time she is in Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
town centres annually reject 160@@ ,000 people
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s emergency services are rejected by the community centres each year , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further medium @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three out of five people - mostly elderly persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ances and similar - on their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already fully utili@@ sed , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rell community centres said that the last survey of the National Federation of Women &apos;s Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have been rejected every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s city care centres are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debt , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Justice Minister and sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately susp@@ end these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Ele@@ gan@@ t Campa@@ ign indic@@ ted after employees allegedly drew weapons
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after it has been told that in February their campaign manager for North Carolina put a fire@@ arm on an employee while they were travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment which was filed on Wednesday at Charlotte &apos;s Regional Court by Vincent B@@ rist@@ i , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ ord@@ i stated to have been waiting for months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and cur@@ led the course in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign management , he stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he announced in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not need to be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a uph@@ eav@@ al when he said a crowd of people in North Carolina to take action if his rival was to be elected H@@ illary Clinton and appointed judge .
the Tr@@ ump campaign clearly stated that the media had ri@@ pped his words out of context and that he would not cause violence .
B@@ coordinator &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care and by Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; press spokesperson &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not to be reached for a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
he has not responded to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far led a controversial campaign .
the proceedings are B@@ ordin@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) are notable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling parties .
this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could barely continue to go@@ vern , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin .
but in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD collap@@ sed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was just ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent again .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 per cent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the Parliament .
despite the slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens were again in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent respectively .
according to the pol@@ l of the poll@@ s , the SPD could only reach 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
at 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , they were still behind the Gre@@ ens ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the Ab@@ ge@@ ord@@ net@@ enhaus with 14 percent for the first time .
at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , but the pirates would not miss the move by contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator entered the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , which would last for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came back exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the age of the age of the Internet age .
twenty years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the west ash@@ tray format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could set a lot for then standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , although agon@@ izing slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud the price was : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros .
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
no one could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &quot; cell division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and processed to Microsoft .
today the market domin@@ ates suppliers who all came much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
approximately 1.4 billion units were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units were sold .
worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has ar@@ isen around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came first at the beginning of 2007 , when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone on the Mac World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all easy to use by touch screen .
the Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al procession , still today , is the iPhone &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look .
they disappeared eventually , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of personnel at the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction in He@@ a@@ JET , just as we did in London in 2012 when we had a great deal of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities alone , we are already employing 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , creating 40,000 new jobs and ending youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlar@@ ging heads is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be flo@@ cking on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in atmospheric growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and the whole UK .
we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is backed by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s 2012 games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; with regard to ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software companies attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display loos@@ ening on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post where users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertisements in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the page advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the appealing open source community and the b@@ yp@@ assing has already been in progress since the invention of display loos@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media enterprise has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator block@@ ers have become the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use the display lock@@ ers , almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks from .
the company has switched to ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs has a large proportion of revenue , so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad preferences pool &quot; to allow people to have more control over their advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook announced that new filters would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokesman in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b means , which is why we have concentrated on developer tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences instead to put more control into people &apos;s hands .
driving a woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police witnesses witnesses when a woman was convic@@ ted in the early hours of the morning on a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d , shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman laid down in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were taken by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was convic@@ ted of several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , &quot; said the police , who sum@@ mon@@ ed them as well as any witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative process was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter distributed the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person walked in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the motorway as it was said in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after she had transferred and killed a man who had lain on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street , took the court .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who responded to an emergency call -- to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once inhabited
the Venus could probably be inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the NASA &apos;s Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could once have rejected such conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , ear@@ thy atmosphere and nevertheless slowly shifted .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from a fast ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus displays its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected of planets explor@@ ers .
although it was originally inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions of years .
their oceans di@@ apor@@ ated and their steam was burnt out by ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a le@@ thal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ns as a coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively president / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the club is immediately looking for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy said in a statement .
during the summer I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , needed it and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to the organization .
it also has to have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contribution to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and we wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the League .
he led the association to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the off @-@ season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches marked a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference at five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ di@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , resume strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles on wages for North @-@ Sea workers are suspended , while all parties sit down for a new round of talks , negoti@@ ators said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the present strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , beginning next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ re merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had increased by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week in order to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers gather the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates beneath the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in star enh@@ ancements to different rates as well as in which context the rotation periods are related to planetary formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now on the quick@@ est .
to peak rot@@ ational rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars come out large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
if a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble star@@ spot -- such as sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates suggests that more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars .
grape compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is much more to us than we would like to learn more about how the How , When and Why stars will slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang their &quot; dancing shoes &quot; so to speak .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades that will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base zu Base .
after his emotional resignation , the 41 year old pro will wear the Tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Parti@@ cip@@ ant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez became the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract granted him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as consultant and youth coach - with a full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez came back with performance for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made some mile@@ stones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys only two other bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be included in the glory hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star joined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have taken prohibited ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was blocked for 2@@ 11 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ Genesis scandal .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received performance @-@ promoting agents for years beyond an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell days also did not run sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball legends still get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who had been married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received the sympathy of the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ ri@@ vals Boston red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the fans at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Team .
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio must not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
an experienced athlete had almost won a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events in Rio de Janeiro have become known .
Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been tested positive in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to an un@@ timely fashion .
at Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was proven , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the 50 m Fre@@ estyle pass .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter seriously and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S , is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
the news of the positive sample of Dan@@ ek@@ ova also le@@ aked in the night of Rio , and the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is reported to be the dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O in the forbidden substance .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample has already been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately reported criticism of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to take part in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days previously positively on the an@@ aboli@@ c ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny ing@@ es@@ tion , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world federation had forbidden the entire Russian crew except for systematic dop@@ ing , even the Kenya region has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in swimming @-@ sport , the previous Ver@@ gence in China also ensured fierce disputes also among the athletes .
for instance , the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang Har@@ sch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the heart of an engagement with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ d@@ sters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been tested positive for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ dine in the Chinese championships in 2014 , but had to settle for only a three @-@ month lock .
data @-@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ jack hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware currently attack companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partly victim to an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already at the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes the perpetrators speci@@ alize in attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially ex@@ tor@@ ting ran@@ som is significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware were still designed to send advertising .
then the offen@@ ders discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to corporate attacks was terri@@ fying in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for un@@ altered files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files en@@ codes the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als permanently .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the final code to the files , the victim must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin - .
but where private users find the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 per cent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be acute due to the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of a stand@@ still in operation .
the hack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety investig@@ ators of F @-@ Secure scrut@@ ini@@ zed the areas of use and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a sort of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain their victims per chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support sites or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private people are saved after payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share their jobs , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the program@@ mers sell their malware then in the form of a software package to the actual test@@ ers .
the so @-@ called malware kits were created by purchasing malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is a matching tool so smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ ges then seek further hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissions a further one to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment will take place per infected calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey are confident that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful capture , the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as lists of customers or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
in the future , the perpetrators will also be able to take on completely new targets on the internet of things .
at the de@@ con conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat associated with the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such blocked heating could well be a ran@@ som .
if the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é , and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work in any place .
the interior materials are well @-@ finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top is slightly falling .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with raised back rests and 10@@ 26 l when folded back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat areas of the rear bench can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded easily , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rpm ranges .
however , he is likely to turn his work somewhat more quietly .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the city emergency braking assistant ( working up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and lane keeping support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote lighting assistant works very reliably .
and the smart template re@@ acts to the traffic sign detection and d@@ ros@@ sel@@ t speed when needed .
but the full connectivity is only available for top @-@ level equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation system , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI bus@@ hing are lying under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 Euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
a Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht &#91; Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only in case of dangers which are typical of aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee injury during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when paid by the Organ@@ izer
after their journey , sick people only get money back when the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests proved to show the same symptoms .
in the case , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their visit to the door .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease caused the holi@@ day@@ makers to return to a defective waste water treatment plant , which was said to have poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip had been fla@@ wed - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .

de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said after the violent acts committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks .
the state must be sensible and determined at the same time to react to acts of terrorism .
safe is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division .
we won &apos;t treat this triumph to the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , the security and strength also increase the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère aims to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit order of magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must again be under penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the weapon law has been am@@ ended to make it difficult for the purchase of weapons on the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most recently discussed duty of confidentiality for physicians is to be respected according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to search for solutions on how to reduce the risk of citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers a better social care necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .

it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against Action@@ ism .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship previously . &quot; &quot; &quot;

better traffic flow on the free@@ way feeder
it st@@ ews regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this is supposed to change : the legal tender should be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the road every night when they travel over the motorway to the feeder ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) between Hammer Street and Wes@@ er Straße at 700 meters .
drivers can then thread directly from the hammer road on the right .
the big advantage : traffic con@@ forms early on , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder annoying mot@@ orists in particular between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the retreat extends up to the bridge across the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the departure Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is only guided in one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back over a quarter of a century ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity , in order to absorb mainly heavy traffic .
the competent regional company cannot say how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated work stopp@@ age will last .
however , with years to count , the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal dispute , the state company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because it had to be reck@@ oned with disabilities .
traffic will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
inter@@ kultureller Jour@@ neys : cultural De@@ als for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of Wald@@ schule has visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the little house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has committed itself to the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most of the youngsters in the class were coming to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action , the press release of the Young Theatre Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ ying , and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migrant backgrounds will be able to attend professional courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical convey@@ ance are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; goes on .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has taken the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south west of Germany on the night to Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we will see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars .
they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning is already far from the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , such problems are in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
what are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for S@@ leep Medicine and S@@ leep Medicine .
what is understood among them , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , an influ@@ x and sleeping distur@@ b@@ ance .
many people find just sleeping as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the Executive Board at the German Dental Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
in@@ frequently , the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is particularly frequent in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors afflic@@ t one another .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can sleep well , wake up every two to three hours and possibly begins to pon@@ der over everyday problems and worry , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I have sleep disturbances to the doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , advises We@@ eß .
the impair@@ ment may look quite different : you are beaten , tired , ind@@ eli@@ ble , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options include , among other things , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; emphasizes the lack of settled medical practitioners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems , advises We@@ eks .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
for example , in case of snor@@ ing with respiratory infections , in case of abnormal day@@ time fatigue , for sleeping trans@@ duc@@ ers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ etze ob@@ serves .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after disgu@@ sting , one goes to bed at its normal time .
beside the electrodes in the body one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger .
in addition , a camera has the sleeping end on the ceiling .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can apply for a better sleep .
we@@ a@@ thing counts : regular sleep and up @-@ up times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp has to have with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook to disap@@ point the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he first brought gold at the World Championship in Doh@@ a and at the same time exhibited his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team@@ mates in front of his ex @-@ team@@ mates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € award and a jungle chef 150@@ ,000 € no one should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in swimming sport is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote very much and do not even see or even run dop@@ ing on the topic of dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have had to report nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how one should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS by independent inspec@@ tors of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream shop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of baggage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
on Thursday , two women and two men aged 50 to 61 were arrested by the Düsseldorf police .
the susp@@ ects had made several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage ste@@ els .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civilian officials at the airport of Düsseldorf recognized a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft off@@ ences .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July of this year and in doing so were common , firm and very professional .
the specialists of the Criminal Police Department 34 can prove four acts to the thi@@ eves who have been travelling to Germany specifically to commit crimes .
they had carried over 15,000 euros in total .
old buildings , a few aven@@ ues of lime , in between still a rem@@ nant of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes by playing grounds , a newly painted nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed at the facade of a grey house .
opposite a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demoli@@ shed , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is , however , preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin @-@ based sen@@ ator , Henkel had expressed himself repeatedly for a tough enforcement of the police against the project , the area called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for police and 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 22 June the premises on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ ro@@ gated the police three weeks according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team @-@ cars on site , blocked parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers are renov@@ ating the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers pulled away from sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the street acts peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about late late .
a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects .
left force is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who lives here three children , are above all anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z who wished for a majority of police protection from the v@@ and@@ alizing left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police between house occup@@ iers and their neighbours open , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which today , in comparison with the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high poverty risk .
in 1990 , many houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost all of the Main@@ zer Street near the R@@ ī@@ ga .
while the Main@@ zer was cleared in a regular street battle , many of the projects in the R@@ ī@@ ga were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the bor@@ ough has become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world : with them , residents of G@@ DR times and former home occup@@ iers are now sharing their Kie@@ z .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them on raised slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were disc@@ arded with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left autonomous force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as bodily injury do , according to statistics , almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
the most important part of the crimes are criminal charges , which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no question of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is appe@@ al@@ ingly : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars are no longer there in the R@@ ī@@ ga no longer .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and stayed .
that &apos;s why it was so important for her to get back home : from the police , politics and the media , all of whom suddenly demanded the interpretation of the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : fac@@ eless new buildings in former building holes that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well beha@@ ved are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot appro@@ ve of violence and destruction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for retired people who are angry about color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who come up should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area , can complain poorly about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee en@@ voy for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all the actors : refugees , Arbeits@@ kreis Refu@@ gee , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is here now , the ice @-@ breaking wo@@ olen pig , which above all has a problem .
thus some - less mo@@ cking rather than relying on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write out the job .
we were looking for an administrative capacity with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an accomplished wool @-@ milk @-@ sow .
but administration work is not their central area , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent stake for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honor and full time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers stand in the was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the District Office to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration doesn &apos;t find private apartments .
until now , it does not work , so that one is dependent on private apartments , Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , communal dwell@@ ings must be restored as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the was@@ en@@ straße .
but it is only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed stay , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and spending activities for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ one or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need special offers such as sports , contact with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also administration and honorary officials jump here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can spend time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , cannot work and be useless , he will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are also problem cases , says the customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing is possible . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some people might call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed already .
these incidents are also the subject of the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would completely ob@@ liter@@ ate them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they don &apos;t have anything to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region .
they always have in the background that a new collision may soon come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , the policy is afraid .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach people are already busy integrating the previous people in a reasonable way .
currently , these are about 100 people , predominantly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : burg@@ lars are looking for a helicopter
