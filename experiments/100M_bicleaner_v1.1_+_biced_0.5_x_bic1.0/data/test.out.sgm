<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues sought a little change with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they drove home to the trough for the fast gallop.</seg>

<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And that's what the riding career ended up with.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all time was - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself go with his family about the system of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even hover himself for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid presented the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala decorated the Golden Sport Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, silver bay leaf, Champions Tour player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen hasn't added it to him.</seg>

<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued with the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="24">The results include the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Giant, the founder of Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Driver Meinhard Neck, the Springfield Alwin Shockemöhle and posthum the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trading agreement - both Clinton and Trump intend to do.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidential candidates are not unaffiliated with fiscal and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump is in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claiming Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drive back regulations drastically, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: "the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich are increased, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In which must be invested, trump and Clinton tend to say almost verbatim.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate agreement wants to terminate it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand and demand the renewable energies with its investment programme: "a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want we to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid even better, for example, Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rattled, then he says that he cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in boosting growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point to him that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the rich demand that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps are often regarded as inferior and abused at worst.</seg>

<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to approve new combat activities in their disputes regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) called for the whole Council to approve more work campaign measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC stated that ministers agreed to respond to the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistance physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the Chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would "persistently calm" to problems, leading to the fact that the treaty was rejected.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "In view of this, the JDC Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and demand official new negotiations on all your concerns." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board has submitted a formal application to a special meeting of the BMA Council today in order to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work campaign measures starting in early September.</seg>

<seg id="11">The head of the BMA assistance doctors Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms, which had been recommended by the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hand over their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed narrower and he did not radiate heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan would have behaved as if there had never been a bad thing.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin announced and accused Ankara to fall back on Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, as it was done by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the veto becomes difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one point it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious accusations were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been removed last month with a failed coup d'etat almost of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television approved cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists are long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West, as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the continuing grudge of the EU accession negotiations and Putin, which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state in Ankara won with security a bonus for claiming support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is clearly a matter of course for Moscow, which even has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an "Alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described to me: two countries that break away from the West and feel bad and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey are supporting opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents concluded at the press conference that they would not even have grasped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to stress them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian President humbles Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergey Ivanov's chief of staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the narrowest circle of confidence of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement of the Kremlin it reads that without giving reasons, Putin has ordered the resignation of Ivanovo from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow International Relations Institute (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is said (in Russian) that he was later the director and chief executive of the government staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he told Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin announced on Friday the Russian TV station that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince you?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works as he is for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the episode of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this right now.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was touted as a potential president, wants to direct Russia's environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated position - one could almost say - to entrust shallower posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, as Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once accepted that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of office violated Putin's constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally of Putin's allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensin crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closing of the" "" "deck blowers" "", "which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 helical ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economic Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Queensin crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epical degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the gap between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky job that requires extremely precise tolerances for fitting.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the entire deck are at their place and the last section of the deck is today in Rosyth a concrete deck for the deck, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first lock represents a significant milestone for each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower, we had to close the gap on the north or the landing page.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="5">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: who should build the affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said SPD leader Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas have to reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can however also arise in the continuance.</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem, said Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to create even tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">No matter what Bratmann does, there is a sharpening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete: the approx. 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compensate for the loss of further around 1300 favourable apartments, whose promotion will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be bought from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, we would have to think about getting apartments back into price bandaging.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens has been lamented by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go makes it all about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that outdoor technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Naturally I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created.)</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomenons of pop culture, interest in the game was falling in the US, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overweighed the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon that are tracked with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S., the game led to a sizeable increase in steps that lays down the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of followed people who train every day 30 minutes, rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data for performance enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "active every day" "" "hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drive sport reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that's too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also stormy gamblers who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity earlier, they didn't give us a reason to play sports as it does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all of this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamically on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant all the way.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now also Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast knocked on Thursday for the title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mates Aly raisman and the Russian Bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles turnes on the balance beam during the individual multi-campaign camp of women in the arts gymnastics at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American, winning a championship title and overall the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success places them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years of its sport, 15 world world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescued from her said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It awaited her last examination in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the women's singles campaign at the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell celebration of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during her long walk, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no accident.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gym where Boorman exercised, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no competition for competition, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina easily led through two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Aerial beams and ground floor - in which Biles holds the world title - lurked.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and placed another 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">She embraced her softly as she expected her final bear - a mere formality - and tears poured into biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called "granny" by the Americans, had a head start.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her practice, she threw Kusshands to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback, which at times seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of Phoenix's deadliest attacks for a decade, while they stopped in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a firearm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police announced that the triple murder did not appear to be the result of a robbery accident, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shootings led the investigators to get a closer look at if they were connected to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in hispanic living neighborhoods in nine months and two others were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, announced at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990ies, a black BMW from the late 1990ies and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liners, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report about the shooting, which took half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found cartridge shells and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.</seg>

<seg id="2">The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time that a 6-year-old child is shot.</seg>
<seg id="3">The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.</seg>
<seg id="4">The grandparents believed that Brown suffered several shot injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">"he did a lot, his small body was pierced by bullets," said his grandmother Delores Melendez to the transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="6">I can't believe that simply.</seg>
<seg id="7">The boy's condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.</seg>
<seg id="8">The boy's family told the transmitter that it is likely to recover again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the Turning and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been at any Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this crew has three turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, the Catholicin, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team at last reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female female singers was an African-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyrating routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual american woman who won gold at an individual event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the peak of this sport, but so do gymnasiums throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all went the same way as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will have only four turners in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is a costlier sport and Turner is primarily involved in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these Turnclubs are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turner will receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to empower the municipalities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to provide a more affordable and accessible exercise training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the olympic team golds and thank you, you were motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Kommittee for assistance physicians, announced last night in a message: "assistance physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will incite the current workforce crisis and treat it to treat all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time is running out.</seg>

<seg id="7">About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and one quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls, which form deposits.</seg>

<seg id="11">Persons who have had a heart attack are subject to higher risk of having a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year for the dismissal of a government report on corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities wisely ignored like a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally grabs the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an antagonist-king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral boxes in order to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "he recommends that voters should carry out an identification card to prove their identity in elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter only needs to name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes not applying removable ink on a person's finger when they release their vote to prevent anyone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to congregational documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged from Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets's election scandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special election tribunal decided that the incumbent mayor of Luton Rahman should be relieved after a litany on corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "the Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "" "in cynical ways" "" "and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have made "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the consequence of imitation in which one person as someone else chooses.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">In particular, he expressed alarm on the fraudulent letter election - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including leading expressions to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "in his report it says:" "" "evidence has been made that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elders, especially communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi backgrounds."

<seg id="26">Systematic reviews about the nationality of a person perform to make sure they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter election.</seg>

<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to make sure that the staff rule out that voters go alone in the electoral cab.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it" "" "amazing" "" "that after the Tower Hamlets case there was no criminal record." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller submerged his immune system and the worms-lex for a serious test - by leaking up some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk dragged his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a flush toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before dropping each object, he used a luminometer to show up and show us what to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment, filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "brought some surprising results to daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of dragging the rinsing button on a tractor that has been used by thousands of others may be totally repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings at stations to washing dumpling of toilets, the task posed to its immune system definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial showed a luminometric rating of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a russian toilet which he refused to lick up after their luminometric number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst I have in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirtier than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming, which ended up saying" "" "Let us call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had asked some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the disgusting russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey carried out in 2015, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing the added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left her social home after a delogiation with a loss of £50,000, because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skelon and her partner Shaun Trefigurcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were lined with holes, wooden planks were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think that people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider, as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror which the family had inflicted, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, disputes and floods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skelon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">Old trash was found in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate, in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were torn</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly invoked the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delounded them and their partners this week by force from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily undress.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogizing was cheered by lightened neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one said," "" "They didn't care for anybody." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement managers of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years long</seg>
<seg id="26">Rubbish and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the church building.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the renter agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family because a deletion is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be horrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and gave us the information provided.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers in the house management will now have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>

<seg id="37">After they were homeless, it was assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were graded with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say they will deloge tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not again take place directly at the end of summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For more stupid as so far it is not: summer holidays, heat and land election campaigns - that's the bite.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the polls, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the country, on the shores of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so don't choose the day of the day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, spread flyers and end up counting, just drive them laboriously.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and final holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass an election campaign on the people over itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, when you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">What is exciting is how much newbie AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dusting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a bit with the people, just as he did his legendary worthier Harald Ringstorff also.</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "" "" "the CDU with its leading candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is if you make electoral campaigns at the right time at the right time." ""</seg>

<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats, last with 22 per cent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election 2011, the SPD had clearly gained 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap into the Landtag.</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-Renovation: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is sanitized, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30am and only end at about 20 o'clock, there are always praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything quite fine," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, the receipt of the responsible for the construction works is also commended, for example when it comes to the installation of neccessary trips.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has been relocated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen been lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg has been reversed, the traffic situation within the resort has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">Citizens can now turn from Ofterdingen back on both sides from the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive travel through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were some significant complaints," "" "says the deputy chief conductor, Florian King, responsible for the project traffic management." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise as many sneakers were looking for and more familiar with their navigation system than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were frying in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not complied with, the congregation lifted the car from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," says King, who made himself aware of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have already been banded.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest speed was 77 km / h in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved, it has become calmer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the street is open for customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27-Renovation has led to sales breaks with them lets everyone who is asked can look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer" are therefore produced for other companies, for whom the restoration hardly has consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "even at dealership Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "" "most slight drop" "", "but also acknowledges that of course" "" "the trajectory is missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most bagged places are the local restaurants along the street.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly a crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only it, but all the restaurants have "hit hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "we must be happy about every euro turnover." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the sales revenue is" "" "far above 50 percent" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the refurbishment of the streets prevented its operation" "" "two years ago." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He must have dismissed half of his collaborators.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, with the advice given that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now, it must also bear the disadvantages inherent in the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where things get more spacious.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, referring to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regulars are now less frequently passing by because of complicated traffic guidance.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't ride, it is also somewhere else nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his pedigree is coming back at the end of the renovation works, there is no doubt that Göhner has no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises of BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis he has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="11">After the recent attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière fell short of time before presenting his conclusions for the safety of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "these will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "the CDU acknowledges." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He still believes this to be reasonable and demands nothing, which is not a chance for the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented by de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They partly have it in themselves: he plans fast procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detention before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In case of tolerations for expired asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than so far - about those who commit crimes or intentionally throw away their papers in order to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are politically and legally precluded.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some things have an effect even more incomplete and leaves questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of people, for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be argued that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people profoundly dealt with could not be clenched even in electoral times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are electoral campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD are therefore increasingly moving into position on the topic of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days, between the two parties it was very high.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garristic dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the resort leaders also demand a burka ban and a return from dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière also struggles for conciliatory notes.</seg>
<seg id="39">He does nothing of a departure from the double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To do something new, don't make sense.</seg>
<seg id="42">And with a Burka ban he has constitutional objections.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether his own package is unconstitutional at all corners and whether it is "reasonable" is for the coalition partner, has yet to show itself.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section, to sow him under the pseudonym of non-AlleOne male-female middle-aged with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed re-emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobbysm collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers prefer their feelings for themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and ferment wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something sprinkling like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent vendors were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I run from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into the Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy when they appeared and once again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 1960s, early 70's who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably something too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" "" "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he hits will apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noted a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I've conducted, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of fans of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ some of the older customers took part in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some fans of the record feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that call up happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector, and I think it's like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a staff from a record pile wipes out." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I smoothen through a stack of bossa nova come compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone recently came in here and said," I don't own record players, but I would like to buy a radiohead sound record so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-friendly, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have record players." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not the older ones, who come in only slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who take photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sexually-packed pop instead of experimental jazz, is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but obvious psychic traumas are hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window stroll as a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives away with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I am pretending to have a pair of jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov agree, they, at least in record shops in Soho, don't take into account the large number of female collectors that exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their thursday morning with security with the stroll through the shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the starring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who worries about the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial hearing this week the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which people within the camp offer goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would involve a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that businesses and restaurants were important as free meals offered by the state-backed Association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also argued that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely traceable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the raindrops was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is non-serving and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as providing advice on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's Raser must adapt to the next generation of speed meters: new flashes of lightning are being tested in various federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, which are intended to be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic-acting Enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, on accidents, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed poles, there is often no need for infrastructure to provide a stationary flash for compliance with speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">A durable mobile construction can however be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement operation; the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measurement technology can also detect all vehicles across multiple tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as transit access by time, passenger strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the state-run condition, one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hitch.</seg>
<seg id="10">So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measurement operation so that the wheels in the armored and incidentally also sweat-proof outer shell disappear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the lightning from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic in various federal states and is now also being used.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-day rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji has given a master class in the handling, side steppe, back, line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji could have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for the UK - but it won't be - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, she lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This stage will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderfull and had the attacks of GBs pruning out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run into driving busses. the World Series winners went up 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau hatched in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With only four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he changed.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A Mitchell hoisting torch stopped the mount of Sierra Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but Fiji stopped only.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Athjasa Veremalua left a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for the UK.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restarted and there was still more than a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed down to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijianic vulnerability... for all four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed through Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for the GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sultan, whose fans sang, flirting flags and dancing on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle rang, the fijis hugged themselves and GB crutched crunched into the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the past, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a small semi-finals match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for a stroke win</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinal gold than in these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder to the last, 220 Hard Hieve, who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when she rudled the second Olympic team in a row without a starboard, the first women in the history of British sports who placed such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39th undefeated use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who did not know if he was diagnosed with cancer before 30 months ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he is risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do this, he spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had been lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, off the season, which kept the break to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was hospitalized and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-irritating morning talking about anything else than otherwise, trying to process his own fears.</seg>

<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and there have always been innovations, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green power generation are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains at the liberation of the Renewable Energy Transition in the existing plants for the so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry, said German Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Newspaper" (WAZ, open day edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>

<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works trap an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this too will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on self-electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">So the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry have particular significance.</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "even in the reform of emissions trading, climate and employment targets are weighed down," "" "said IG Metall-CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation intensified, when the world's largest producer of products threw steel on the world market in light of the weak domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accused Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a little.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import stole effects, on the other hand, the economic outlook grew up in China.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price-picking is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lastly, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last but not least, ThyssenKrupp wanted to avoid closing individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel producers are cautious in spite of rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Division distributed steel on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the produced quantity went back in succession for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">The association expects an improved order situation in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has accompanied her whole life as a young girl. as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's degree she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78 year old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">After all, singing is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, Hackler describes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">In doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs will not get out of their everyday routine as quickly as they are in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people singing often has a very special effect, "says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der senior-Organisationen.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations shared singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that the singing or hearing of songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-centred people are depressed for long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special performance is required for the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate simultaneously on one's own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The feeling of self-esteem increases by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I do long for something, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are enough reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try out a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, says Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior chorus, one can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can direct themselves directly to the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found over the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="9">Friday morning, two explosive devices went up again, another man was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket, a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured during the detonation near the beach of Patong popular with tourists.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country another bomb exploded, killing a city clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the demolition went into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">After all, there were several injured detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-western coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," "" "said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday early in front of journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that this is a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to comment on possible motives - but probably the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks, typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist rebellion or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, restricted to restricted areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Instead, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">Over the past few days, the authorities would have received secret information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed of the exact date and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police ordered their officials throughout the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but mostly do not judge tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace used by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the present bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no need to travel to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This admits to the military major influence in the coming years as well.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country was moving towards stability, improving economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, which in 2014 had seized power after a phase of bloody unrest, remembers the kingdom to restore stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the insurgency of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympic Games or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habré at the Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the clipping was chosen.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habla then became a viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a return of 48 seconds and took the 59th place of 59 runners.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that drew the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special rigid law from the International Swimming Federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in sub-represented countries better known.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because in Ethiopia, most sportsmen run, Habla just wanted to do something else.</seg>

<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Eric Moussambani ran for media attention at the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmers from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete on his own for a 100 meter free race.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic and had never had such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of waste water will take place from October 1, 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welsh, 3.44 instead of 2.10 Euro; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (previously 2.18 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will be increased once again, if appropriate improvements are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After an overly sluggish calculation, the sewage at Azendorf will be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household by the District Office of Kulmbach, Kulmbach was established that for these wastewater facilities there were overlappings.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants at a cost-covering basis.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial enterprises from Welsh, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg have to take deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">Revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt displayed the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation can be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained that in all three sewage installations there were relatively small facilities with a very low drainage system, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, due to the low distribution base, for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age, refurbishment and repair expenses were not least due to the age of refurbishment and repair in all three systems.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welsh, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the waste water plant in Azendorf as a result of damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the Welsh pump station, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled and, after nearly 20 years of operation, the first clarification pond had to be excavated, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses were the amortisation and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in line with the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 were still clearly below the current level.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of a small waste water attack in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance were "fully exploited."</seg>
<seg id="20">In the past 20 years, Schmidt explained that the market community has been spared from major maintenance costs for wastewater facilities in the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to stone houses, the situation for the above-mentioned facilities will remain precarious, especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater utility company cannot be extended by these facilities because it is a deficit-bearing institution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million selfies selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past, Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in which they were accused of promoting the app Blackface conveyed or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it suggested a filter to some users this week, which gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage was widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat told that it had disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was thought to be a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders, who experienced racism, reminded the filter of hurting clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely used across the photos, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and unsatisfactory."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the confrontation of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the descending limb.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural mine.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats's great audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could expect to expect sensitivity more likely.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and in a telephone interview she said that she believes racer-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the majority of white male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinesich-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures for the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently recruited a HR officer focusing on subversive population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "Zhu also said that she will shut down her Snapchat account and added," "" "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K." "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Military Leadership Skills ISIS Secret Service Information, Concludes Congressional Committee</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence-based information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than would have allowed the actual conditions on site reported in a Thursday report.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Army Committees, Secret Service Committees, and the Arms budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence-based information, typically patched by high-level CentCom commanders, regularly recorded a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism, as the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at the CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, stated." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the CentCom reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct indications that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts felt exposed to pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom Affiliate announced publicly that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, it's so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's tips changed the intelligence reports to shut down the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force in life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are under way by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "announced the high-ranking Demokrat in the Committee of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "compensated the morals among analysts and" "" "there was insufficient room for diverging opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats claimed to have found no evidence of a White House intervention in CentCom analysts concerning "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon inspector who received complaints from CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the reports of the Congress while the investigations of the General Inspectorate were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes over more than ten years ago when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush foresaw a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, according to government authorities, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, they had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="1">The US wins fourth match in women's field-hockey, a showdown with Great Britain stands before</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after firing three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games were supposed to represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said that she couldn't remember anything ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, she knows that the American women lie at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Britons at first place, who after their 2-0 victory against Japan are unbeaten.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place in their group from six teams each.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutch some time out of the way leading the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising fuss about their success story, four years after they ended up in the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time with three years a hockey club (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the National actress of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the 2008 Olympics as she couldn't qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the national team and thus began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," "" "said Bam." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work package in London we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the rudder to be able to tear it all around.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a setback from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball on the left flank, then moved to the center and drew the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament to be the goal keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who so far had to pay a goal in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro events are constantly and inescapable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, which is passed by the wristguard to a swimmer to a gymnast to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queues in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the conflict between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's swarm with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names that would be sent to Prime Time, by sponsor and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, Turner or even Fechter.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing in gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partially in the shadow are the sports which are not generally accepted: pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the swimming pool and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw your attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so scarce that many of them, I had questioned, did not know that it was at all an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who are for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain exterior charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a dealer.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending pop-up - but also the grazie of gymnastics and scuba diving, the two sports which essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means so much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, halves and balances) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be judged according to the official Olympic program according to specification, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympian vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to go farther in their pursuit of gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes down and back, upwards and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the pretext, but also another highlight in the television broadcast: the world or the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful aspiration is posh, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel a bit tiring even when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly upwards again.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time, which the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days starting at 2: 00 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympics, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Turner suggested recently according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to breathe.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a Generation Protects" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia backed the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed while colliding with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the past few months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was merciless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council demands a detailed investigation now.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror-driven countries, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued to suppress oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was constrained, and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "when you suppress people and have no other options to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea are increasing; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line prompted hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades, which have been enforced more or less in recent years, will exploit the turbulence and be able to arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of exposure to the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians issued that they were so much protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amfortas, who come from Ethiopia's mainly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economics, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even that is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to co-ordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amresas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, the secret services, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special orders to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the North Ethiopian Tiger Region, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an uproar was in 2005 after thousands protesting against elections which, according to analysts, were apparently leashed by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the raids that followed, many protesters were killed, even if there were fewer than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty alleviation.</seg>
<seg id="53">But it was obvious that this did not prevent the Ethiopian government's internal dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, a Thai town, attacked by Tigray and hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the base for dronging flights over neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its allies to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this," "" "said Mr Abdi," "" "is a very thin tightrope walk." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his claim to Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multi-repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raises new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his fellow-workers, who endeavour to take protection during an event-rich period, into the peculiar position to explain statements that he does not mean at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump broke back with regard to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation totally serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help him weaken the statement by recalling that Mr Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know none of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to casualties.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton maintained speeches on the Michigan economic situation this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he raised strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he declared "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction falls." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vage enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more corroborated tone since its survey values have declined.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was released on Friday, showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to not excuse himself for his provocative remarks, he frequently accused his critics of distorting his statements or misleading his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while reinforcing the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps have brought down his loyal comrades to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, made great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked to the correctness of Mr. Trumps claims whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenches, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread itself by allowing it to take control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of rocking on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apologies as just another evidence that he was inappropriate for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once crowded at the price of the market, Café in Greenpoint returns</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a biggy café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that was not Wi-Fi, but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices came out of its Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie's shop, which was sold in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people claimed it as a final loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap store."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change it is also a new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing associate of the old café, owner and managing director of the new coffee bar.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a client offered to provide funds for a new outshell, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, retained a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels purchased the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishing like capers and acidic onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural disasters.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "many old customers were also pushed out by awards from Williamsburg," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg in the past and visited the verb on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drinking a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it became clear to me that it was in the coffee and culture in the verb I liked," "" "she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As foodies, President Roosevelt had a faible for sophisticated delikatessen on Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu this day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans to eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes Last book "Chop Suey" acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" talked about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food-perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "their latest collaboration," "" "A decent meal" "", "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, local snack in the Flatiron District, which is already in store since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "" "" "rich food was very popular," "" "said Ziegelman." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut-bread, loaf-cheese and bean-bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap which stretches the ingredient.</seg>

<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have been in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years prior to the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cook for male rims and it was served freshly baked pâté for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to starving European during the First World War. "a Square Meal" records the paths with which the country turned out to be no longer the land of land.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when food for Americans became a central, tense theme," "" "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserolle as a "wonderful way to recycle food residues," Brickman noted, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Unique mixtures were tried out, as a low-calorie and nutritious satisfaction was preceded by taste or even healthy kitchenware.</seg>

<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home reception recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or ever, domestic economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - attacked the eating habits of the country.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household women" and the challenge to transform pamphlets like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">Particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to the starving citizens, like President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-cake-eating attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmer's kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke like the million-dollar man from the world to which he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was delightfully realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the attitude of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors brought by Ms. Roosevelt that the White House produced the most tedious food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, dealing with food, was rejected as soon as the country returned to its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how they could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "she had a real fear of food waste," "" "said Coe." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks mostly come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks get offspring only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland-shark swims alongside the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it counts, the five-metre-long animal speeds up to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle shaped by slowness seems to be a recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland hai who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland-haiarks become stone-old for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-sharks are hard to observe, after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow-motion was her, when she made six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prey do this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for carcasses that toreal from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland-sharks, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest Hai was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimetre was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lentil core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are not renewed again later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lentil core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons investigate larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters in length, the lentils contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons. in 2012 it should have celebrated its 50th birthday.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the larger Greenland-sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lentils, which results from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 for a 493 cm long Greenland-shark, while the record-Hai with 502 centimetres should be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">The fact that Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland-haie with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methane dialects live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck stuck a 120 year old harpoon tip was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs into sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they ripen later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources more in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewish director smashes the Berlin hotel because Israeli dialling was removed after "Arab" challenge - RT News</seg>
<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media revolt after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed an Israeli preselection since it would have claimed Arab guests according to an employee. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," sent his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country's list of countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed among the countries that could be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel has been eliminated and extinguished?</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call centre.</seg>

<seg id="14">The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great disgrace," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were horrified and upset by this event.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is really very shameful.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this chain of hotels is even an even greater disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="18">This does not require any explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "we expect the hotel to" "" "draw the right conclusions" "", "said the minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent in the year-on-year comparison.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly, the ambassador said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies have established connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch, St. Anna, were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were met.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the period up to the next Romustrant pilgrimage in two years, the Federal Council of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Different pilgrimage destinations have been examined and one finally decided for the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrim's destination was offered at the Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenbadgers, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and gave the pilgrims a blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we went by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Muenster of Our Lady stands and thus the pilgrimage route from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed by a short pulse with different prayers, songs and written texts in the mornings and evenings.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis crossed fieldbus, chapels or churches again and again to sing a song from specially assembled pilgrims song booklet.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnight stays, each parish church of the local parish was available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty and starchy dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we passed Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day we went to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but had to break down some 500 metres altitude at the heat of the heat and then climbed again afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the bathroom in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg's final stage.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team-Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio as the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took up the anchorage, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. the legend hauled the legend when he stormed home to win a win from New Zealand's favorites.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory, while Hoy scored the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick of taking a modest sixth place in the course of the World Championships in London in spite of the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Green.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in good time as an executioner.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner won an Olympic Champion in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindes fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which execution went in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all skinners to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and fell to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they got onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We placed an Olympic Champion in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hinds admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said," "" "It feels like the whole GB flags at the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win at the Olympics again.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny, who was born just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">© Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the Sprint which starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record winner in London 2012 was 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued in front of the qualification yesterday when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate women's competition, which will be continued tomorrow and ended, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong team of train teams to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to take a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas performed in the background, as the technical director Shane Sutton resigns in April amidst Sexism and Mobbingvordicts as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary call GBs, which reached its climax at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18) are notable losses for the SPD and CDU ruling parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition in the North could barely continue to govern, this is not possible after the survey in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">But in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern the SPD collapsed from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent again.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is fought between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would come to 19 per cent (previously 18.4 per cent), the AfD would represent 19 percent for the first time in the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite the slight losses of 6 per cent (previously 8.7 percent), the Greens were again in the Schweriner Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP were not represented in the Landtag with 3 percent respectively.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the poll of the polls, the SPD could only reach 23 per cent (election 2011: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">At 19 per cent (2011: 17.6 percent), they were still behind the Greens (2011: 17.6 percent), but in front of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>

<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.</seg>

<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, although agonizing slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>

<seg id="19">The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities alone, we are already employing 10,000 new apprenticeships, creating 40,000 new jobs and ending youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>

<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is backed by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus could probably be inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could once have rejected such conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthy atmosphere and nevertheless slowly shifted.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from a fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus displays its day-side of the sun for almost two months," "" "explained scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected of planets explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was originally inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions of years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans diaporated and their steam was burnt out by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their Hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a lethal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotational rates beneath the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate in star enhancements to different rates as well as in which context the rotation periods are related to planetary formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhancements, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star-pile of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now on the quickest.</seg>
<seg id="8">To peak rotational rates, these poignant stars come out large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">If a star fails, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a discernible starspot -- such as sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates suggests that more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Grape compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars slowly pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotational rates.</seg>

<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping events in Rio de Janeiro have become known.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski have been tested positive in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions these messages come to an untimely fashion.</seg>
<seg id="7">At Chen last Sunday the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was proven, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterflies, just 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the 50 m Freestyle pass.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter seriously and demands full co-operation with the investigations," "" "cited Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will work together with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC, but the CAS, is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">The news of the positive sample of Danekova also leaked in the night of Rio, and the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she was innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "explained the Athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is reported to be the doping agent EPO in the forbidden substance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample has already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov immediately reported criticism of the government.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "he said:" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">All weight lifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to take part in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski," the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested like his brother Tomasz three days previously positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny ingestion, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, Danekova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world federation had forbidden the entire Russian crew except for systematic doping, even the Kenya region has produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming-sport, the previous Vergence in China also ensured fierce disputes also among the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">For instance, the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang Harsch.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "sun Yang pinkelt lila." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium above 200 m Freestyle, I want to hand over myself," "" "said Lacourt in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the heart of an engagement with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun had been tested positive for the stimulant Trimetazidine in the Chinese championships in 2014, but had to settle for only a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data-lau: so perfide blackjack hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware currently attack companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware defense specialist Malwarebytes, among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partly victim to an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already at the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes the perpetrators specialize in attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially extorting ransom is significantly higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks was terrifying in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for unaltered files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encodes the ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final code to the files, the victim must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users find the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acute due to the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety investigators of F-Secure scrutinized the areas of use and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a sort of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims per chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are saved after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and share their jobs, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware then in the form of a software package to the actual testers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The so-called malware kits were created by purchasing malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included is a matching tool so smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmages then seek further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and commissions a further one to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment will take place per infected calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammer with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey are confident that Ransomware can be able to repel ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful capture, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as lists of customers or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">As a result, the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators will also be able to take on completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the decon conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat associated with the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such blocked heating could well be a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé, and also the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not work in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well-finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top is slightly falling.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "there is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l with raised back rests and 1026 l when folded back rests, but there is the" "" "Magic Seats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat areas of the rear bench can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded easily, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rpm ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to turn his work somewhat more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the tested top version" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the city emergency braking assistant (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and lane keeping support.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because it assesses many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "when manoeuvring." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote lighting assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the smart template reacts to the traffic sign detection and drosselt speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for top-level equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation system, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI bushing are lying under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 Euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will get the petrol engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning is already far from the wake-up ringing no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, such problems are in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">What are sleeping problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Medicine and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What is understood among them, however, is the insomnia, that is, an influx and sleeping disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people find just sleeping as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Executive Board at the German Dental Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is particularly frequent in depression," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors afflict one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can sleep well, wake up every two to three hours and possibly begins to ponder over everyday problems and worry, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I have sleep disturbances to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: you are beaten, tired, indelible, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options include, among other things, behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "in Germany," "" "Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary" "" "Charité University Medicine Berlin" "", "emphasizes the lack of settled medical practitioners." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems, advises Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in case of snoring with respiratory infections, in case of abnormal daytime fatigue, for sleeping transducers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disturbance, Fietze observes.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After disgusting, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beside the electrodes in the body one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera has the sleeping end on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can apply for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weathing counts: regular sleep and up-up times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not conducive to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, two women and two men aged 50 to 61 were arrested by the Düsseldorf police.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had made several handkerchiefs and baggage steels.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30 p.m., civilian officials at the airport of Düsseldorf recognized a gang that was known to policemen from past theft offences.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July of this year and in doing so were common, firm and very professional.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the Criminal Police Department 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who have been travelling to Germany specifically to commit crimes.</seg>
<seg id="8">They had carried over 15,000 euros in total.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few avenues of lime, in between still a remnant of cobblestones: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes by playing grounds, a newly painted nursery and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone has "ugly!" sprayed at the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is, however, preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin-based senator, Henkel had expressed himself repeatedly for a tough enforcement of the police against the project, the area called" "" "no-go-zone" "" "for police and 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the premises on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, cleared with 300 police officers, patrogated the police three weeks according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team-cars on site, blocked parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers are renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers pulled away from sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the street acts peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about late late.</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and kindergartens are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left force is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who lives here three children, are above all annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez who wished for a majority of police protection from the vandalizing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police between house occupiers and their neighbours open, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which today, in comparison with the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, many houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all of the Mainzer Street near the Rīga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was cleared in a regular street battle, many of the projects in the Rīga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the borough has become a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world: with them, residents of GDR times and former home occupiers are now sharing their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them on raised slices or freshly painted facades that were discarded with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year together with the words" "" "left autonomous force" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as bodily injury do, according to statistics, almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most important part of the crimes are criminal charges, which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is appealingly: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer there in the Rīga no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important for her to get back home: from the police, politics and the media, all of whom suddenly demanded the interpretation of the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: faceless new buildings in former building holes that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "this is ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well behaved are living here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I cannot approve of violence and destruction" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for retired people who are angry about color bombs: the house projects and the left-hand scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come up should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area, can complain poorly about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee envoy for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all the actors: refugees, Arbeitskreis Refugee, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is here now, the ice-breaking woolen pig, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less mocking rather than relying on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write out the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative capacity with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an accomplished wool-milk-sow.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration work is not their central area, "says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent stake for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honor and full time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the District Office to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration doesn't find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Until now, it does not work, so that one is dependent on private apartments, Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, communal dwellings must be restored as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it is only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customers and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed stay, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and spending activities for refugees and migrants who need to be undone or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "reports Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need special offers such as sports, contact with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also administration and honorary officials jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can spend time wisely, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling that he can't help in Urbach, cannot work and be useless, he will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problem cases, says the customer honestly, "people with whom nothing is possible." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after the recent occurrences, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer clearly," "" "what some people might call naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would completely obliterate them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they don't have anything to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new collision may soon come to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, the policy is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbach people are already busy integrating the previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">Currently, these are about 100 people, predominantly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
