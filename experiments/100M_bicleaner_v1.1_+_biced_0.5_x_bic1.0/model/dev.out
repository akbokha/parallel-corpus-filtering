Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to speak of the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ sing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing Israel &apos;s ongoing housing construction and is accused of Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal promoted by Obama around Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu has held a controversial address in front of the US Congress , which has been partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call Professor tried to have his girlfriend shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told a somewhat trem@@ bling voice to the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officers found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no evidence that Lamb who traveled in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal call at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
one day after the shooting in the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what was motivated by Lamb .
the details published by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or a criminal history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both established in the Department of Social Sciences and History whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had asked the Delta State University for a complaint for health reasons and said that he has any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy have meant that the promotion that Lamb had worked so hard for him was no guarantee for an automatic path to an assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs &apos;s trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people living there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and has lec@@ tured on geography and education .
he did a doc@@ torate in Early Education in the spring .
one of Lam@@ bs &apos;s long @-@ standing friends described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and lives in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail occurred three years ago on a summer fair .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he was lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialised in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and took part in a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commem@@ oration ceremony on Tuesday evening , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Memorial , while the University Choir sang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back to their return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press author Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb opened the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt and that Lamb in his emergency call called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever been married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
To@@ ys R Us says that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas seasonal workers as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it would plan to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .

Michael J. Fox chan@@ ters his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and an arm &apos;s length from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ question@@ ably the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and cinem@@ as in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN chief reiter@@ ates all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the meeting of the General Assembly of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a break .
but no matter how some Republi@@ can try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys down , it has ( yet ) not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys have shown Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some are beginning to seriously ask what it means for the odds of nom@@ in@@ ating real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them just won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now realize tr@@ umps of per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to flow their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ ump@@ sites have rot@@ ated 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa stated last week that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two out of ten say they were &quot; upset &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about dump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of republi@@ can does not see d@@ umps of temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is seen in the nation &apos;s first country state , I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of the Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality in order to execute effectively his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they impose their money hats , republi@@ can voters keep dump for real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters see Tr@@ ump campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field will likely contribute to drop@@ outs , while anti @-@ dump support is distributed across more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ublic@@ ans , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support .
he gave 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ an @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says they have formed their mind .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have for@@ given their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competitor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump named immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration has been a focal point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of dump crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , it seems that Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
by now , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors , above all due to their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey conducted by ABC / Post , they rather want to have a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they &apos;re also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fern@@ al . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods of Germany
the most expensive con@@ domini@@ um in Hob@@ o is located here , overlooking the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a that@@ ched roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is limited to nature , &quot; it says in the study - hence the high price .
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really low .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top neighbor@@ hoods , however , the price is similar to Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros at nothing - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champions League : dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double sc@@ orer in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pir@@ äus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e made a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; mission Milan &quot; in the witch @-@ bo@@ ilers of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their tournament play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9th ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth star @-@ success in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28th , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received good support from the Champions League matches at the Champions League matches at the Champions League matches of Olympic rocket @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who was going to pass a sha@@ ky shot by the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the top class , among them notable clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled here in 2011 .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too in@@ ventive in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often induced by a shift on the left side of Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ del@@ la@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner of the corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , as Olympic opponent , Ide@@ a Brown struck the head@@ ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with the knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians raised their usual predomin@@ ant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set needle @-@ pins .
but he was reli@@ eved at go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er .
so for example , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola tried to defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cabin , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief executive Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something else out of it is malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Götz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another .
before the game it was in the stadium to craw@@ l .
after a smaller group of partly mar@@ bled Bayern fans apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with sticks to the Munich trailer .
at least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing your teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study .
good news : in case of aband@@ on@@ ment , the risk is falling fast .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to get 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 feet higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , writing the researchers in the Journal of Dental Research .
however , it could take more than ten years before the threat to the level of non@@ smokers sin@@ ks , explained Er@@ dust author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people must persu@@ ade people to become non@@ smo@@ ker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Head of Studies H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health up to old age .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness has been affected , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking lowers the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists find remains from the late Anti@@ quity to Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the second time .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered as an office for arch@@ e@@ ology .
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists now found a solution .
from text documents it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves has been discovered , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman collected by freight train
after a young woman has died at the railway station in the direction of the vul@@ can@@ ic community , the Federal Police is asking the people for help .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 p.m. , the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform and was covered by a freight train that came from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
by recording the train , she carried the sever@@ est of injuries to the Federal Police .
it was treated with emergency medical care and was transported to a hospital by emergency services .
on the grounds of the noc@@ turn@@ al cross @-@ crossing of the young woman there is no evidence of the medi@@ ating function@@ aries .
the incident may be witnessed by witnesses , or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
local residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ bä@@ ck , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) arrive .
critics concerning the cause of the accident can be given at around the clock and free hot@@ line of the Federal Police under phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station .
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the disputed private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström during the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negoti@@ ator in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
the TTIP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration cases fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment tribunal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to be from the EU , the US and from third countries .
a second instance is planned for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
up to now , the proceedings cont@@ ested against each other on arbit@@ rators , and there was no objection to their verdict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice did not trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it intends to work towards an International Investment Court according to its own data .
there could be , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , which was mainly demanded by major corporations , is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel justice , the companies will dispute the tax pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first opinions , anti @-@ TTIP @-@ organisations like Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was mainly critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ y ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress .
in the spring of the reform , the Commission considered essential points that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the legal possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
it remains unclear when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement will be concluded on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
so far , the subject of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
originally a framework for the agreement was to be at the end of this year .
this date is deemed to be no longer valid .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of various places he repeat@@ ed@@ ely records on the map , about his discri@@ min@@ atory and ten@@ derly arran@@ ging songs .
where they arose and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative mis@@ er .
with the released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be harmonious very close to American folk of the late Six@@ ties , but can always be incredibly opul@@ ent at any time .
rum@@ or arises that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 U.S. states should follow .
but already in 2004 and in the clos@@ eness of the Rhine , Seven Sw@@ ans have already appeared and has a positive effect on their expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
his guitar and ban@@ jo live with him live .
one year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a widely celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
overl@@ apping ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album desc@@ ends into the Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any one @-@ year list of the influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic parts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
long since the smaller clubs came out , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and a large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ strong band .
in the dark @-@ kept ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens , which has become more mature , returns to in@@ timacy and folk music .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens only thank@@ ed him for an en@@ core , plays only few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally bowed down with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly anticipated at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire
the new leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is scheduled to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ming and for the first time will be playing with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to issue the first of his six issues shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour Party &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them at a commemor@@ ative ceremony commemor@@ ating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , critic@@ ised a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several front @-@ pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful still@@ ness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , and they were allu@@ ding to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party initially supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pil@@ ing up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements regarding the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour will make changes to remove the whole idea of a restriction in total .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow work and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23.@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box in Parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different approach to policy , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is too face @-@ to @-@ face and that he is subjected to both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ish@@ edness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the dispute with hooks and has instead undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who is going to represent the Shadow of Economic Affairs Minister , if he does not take part - for example , if Mr Cameron is on the move abroad .
he also gave the idea that other colleagues occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesperson of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy theatre , &quot; often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the interro@@ g@@ ator with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds increased by accelerated wage growth in the UK
the Po@@ und rose le@@ aps after data showing an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , the earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % against the same period of the previous year .
since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and delivered estimate at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed by an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of Riv@@ ale AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
according to encouraging news from the competition group for lux@@ uries Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - have again reported growth .
Glen@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by selling shares as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares in the Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper group were the largest los@@ ers at the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had sold his appreciation for the company R@@ ating .
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports accounting company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says higher wages would end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to a pot@@ ter &apos;s idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - in the potato @-@ don@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ ette owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the slogan &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he accidentally saw on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer has been spinning in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has now been submitted to the patent office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authorities .
for this reason , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts ground resistance campaign to fight against diar@@ rho@@ ea
Met@@ ric tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di parade in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA @-@ supermarkets support their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store owners who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ a will release further details of its defence strategy on September 29 when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment will conduct its annual investment strategy day .
there is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of met@@ a @-@ commerce &apos;s I@@ GA store transactions and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to around 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that , twelve months after the opening of its first markets , Al@@ di will take away around five percent of the food market in these two countries and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ a 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the high fixed cost of Met@@ a &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million dollars of earnings before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ a lost market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told at a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s board member has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which provides approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction in simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler def@@ ends and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equal sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products each week and I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores with fast @-@ growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging san@@ itation programs will rise to El@@ an and hopes that the wholesale dealer will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian Tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; got into the spotlight during the not@@ orious examination of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal masters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , soon after , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be split twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison shou@@ ted out , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have struck Kyr@@ gy@@ z and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a force r@@ ins@@ ed a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty busy about is the fact that in my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a bit into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a thu@@ g when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too tightly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is still working hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision not to consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z at the important preliminary decision , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term firm component into the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around it &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick was very quick to climb up what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I think it is appropriate and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary declared the emergency and rated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who were trying to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed along the border , when hundreds of migrants arrested in a No Man &apos;s land , and Ser@@ b officials responded with indign@@ ation .
the people , who had fled from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ pressing the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shou@@ ted insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would accept another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special EU summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on the bal@@ lot action of Brussels or its neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis so they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country would also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having completed a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a considerable bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that strongly contradic@@ ts other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make crossing the border or damage to the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs report in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say very clearly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the military use of the military who is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities reached 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials concluded on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after having arrived a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to get there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders earned her against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is a candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news pol@@ l , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphics groups while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton keeps a big margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support among the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters less than 50 years has ev@@ apor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
Clinton , however , has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with two @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries nationwide say that they would enthusias@@ tically support Clinton if nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about her .
the views are more bl@@ ended for those who do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of the Democratic voters of the elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this via their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time for a woman president to become ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate are also quoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as vice president throws up a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if democratic elec@@ tors are asked to vote for who is their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s supporters say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decided not to fight for the nom@@ ine@@ es of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , of 20 points with bi@@ ds in race on 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best odds of winning the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ ds is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions on the choice of elec@@ torate .
similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ torate winners emerged as unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidate or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
among the three candidates , Bi@@ den works best with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion about S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as foreign minister continue to be placed , most Democratic voters of the primary elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their views overall .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 % see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 per cent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of voters do not see Tr@@ ump as being honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes on leadership .
among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son , many do not think of him .
the sample rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in a country @-@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey conducted by C@@ BS News / New York Times just behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of voters &quot; support in the new survey has dropped , and others lose a dramatic halt .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support dump in large numbers . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , by 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and was sur@@ passing tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can elec@@ tors with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio govern@@ ors John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is growing in the poll@@ s - he lands on 19 % support among the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the dump with 32 % support .
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for asking tr@@ umps belief .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if the peak values are measured only in the distance , one trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea might be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea any more : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College new@@ bies
murder charges were filed against five people almost two years after a student died during a student association in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to move over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood didn &apos;t call on the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less , allegedly waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said forem@@ an Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically set the good of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of Police Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with a bl@@ unt strength injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ ans every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ es family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment due to murder of the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned this - officially or un@@ officially - we will also hold it accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College prohibited the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced their affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest rates , and the domestic market is stag@@ gering , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first compo@@ unding rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets amoun@@ ting to 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a more recent study on what is going to happen after the F@@ ed has been placed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly up@@ war@@ dly - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest , rather flat in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which Bob Dol@@ l , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the rise cycle and the return on returns will begin to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , since 1950 , only twice the nominal GDP has been under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants agreed to raise the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC may appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading will only give a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the development cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sional heights very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far , 74 months .
the fixed income was also volatile because the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Incre@@ asing Cycle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bond yields fall immediately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest bonds often produce better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat@@ ter , lending periods have wi@@ dened and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
large and large companies , who handle the greater part of their business operations in the US , will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will be worse because an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial increase in interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded the average interest rate after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside of pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says EP Member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argues that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated the Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Belgian colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said it was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; says a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ caster does not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham , Conserv@@ ative Member , also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly did not differ from its commercial competitor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also cited the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under another name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what &apos;s already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC general director rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and playing music that &apos;s really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works , I consider it important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage audiences as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to hit the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced &quot; in a special BBC manner . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; found a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it launched an entertainment series next time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future , or to give money to the fee tax@@ pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats .
net sales rose slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday bra@@ ked spending in November
for more than a decade the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures revealed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always evolved over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales strengthened three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it comm@@ utes and we may experience that growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases in advance of the event held last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers went around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could stop shop@@ pers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that out of £ 5 was spent a little more than 1 £ online .
in some products such as TVs and washing machines , more than a third of purchases are now carried out via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are borne by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia reli@@ eves the collapse of the Saudi Ben Laden Group &apos;s huge Saudi Ben Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane collap@@ sed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandfather .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respect , when the first of the dead approached their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession went past the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi king suspended a san@@ ction on the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the disaster , which left 3@@ 94 .
the bodies of 29 star@@ ters who were killed as a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage trip when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual p@@ addle in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , said that the arm of the crane would not stop when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree released by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was forbidden to go abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man asked to reveal what caused the down@@ fall of the crane coming into an inner courtyard of the Grand @-@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not release any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also did not blame the group for not up to date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mos@@ que as part of the massive construction project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the deceased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a revol@@ ting son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said 15@@ 8 people stay hospit@@ alized .
government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other publishers will receive half of this amount .

Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ markt Chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete .
for this reason , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 further screens stores , which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 points of sale from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are made by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to meet the growing demographic trends that show more female single households who make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; It still works a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to move this more towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the helm of a British company listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has staff@@ ed exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in semi @-@ annual profit and sales , after the group reduced the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob on trial because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball Team A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ warding issues at the Kla@@ gen@@ furt regional court .
the accused were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary investigation , the defend@@ ants used money from club accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , for which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was divided by the head of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , the judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense assumed that there was no disadvantage to the association at any time .
the sports officials were only charged with compens@@ ations and the sports club , for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we keep the club further or halt ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ service of large @-@ scale financial audi@@ tors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his co @-@ workers and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , rein@@ forcing our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said when he was arrested . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , only no debt can be made .
furthermore , on the basis of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of expenses compens@@ ations has been determined retro@@ actively by 1991 .
this is why I paid out a portion of the allowance for years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , the former Ob@@ mann described the proceedings as well .
the accounts and savings books jointly managed the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant .
the judge asked why the payments were not disclosed to the association in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association didn &apos;t care in detail for the financial support , important is only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an official investigation for office abuse began in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
that had been set@@ backs , the accused declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to its statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
then he finally thought that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known something of this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant was informed , the function@@ ary justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , wanted to know Ju@@ dge and prosec@@ utor .
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association was never damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never related a cent salary , he paid only mile@@ age and di@@ eting .
at diets , he charged 1,000 euros per month to the association , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were not able to prove accurate documents for the early years .
they were no longer kept up after an audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also referred to o@@ dom@@ eter money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ port@@ ations must be done in cash , and from his place of residence he had to go to the bank to Blei@@ burg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard reaches another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts running for three years , the Compu@@ Ter@@ ese will reduce further jobs when it comes to split@@ ting up the company .
the sub@@ missions at the US @-@ Compu@@ te H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) show no end .
as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology company plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs tot@@ aling EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall in the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs , which has been running for three years , has not yet been completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 fiscal year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
in the after@@ market , the H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard share issued 2.3 percent .
the company , which grew up with printers from Pal@@ o Alto , California , is currently split up : the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led together in a new company , separately from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business segments are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a more disap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for company customers after their services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer , Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
revenues thus declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with an split@@ ting up and massive sub@@ missions to the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted very late that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more business online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of about 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in hos@@ tili@@ ties in Iraq would overwhel@@ m@@ ingly rep@@ el : 54 percent said , by contrast , 35 per cent agreed .

however , 24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian government , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents reject 20 per cent of respon@@ dents .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show

&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility - connected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday after two press days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can attend the IAA from Saturday .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : abor@@ tion on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used several hundred abandoned refugees on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke T@@ rän@@ en@@ as and water thro@@ wer .
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police a police line was formed and a water thro@@ wer was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the police officers .
the officers initially introduced pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now retired .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the lac@@ ri@@ mal grass cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police press spokes@@ persons also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
the world is watching when the US Federal Reserve collap@@ ses on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time in almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surve@@ yed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and the interest rates will remain at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may possibly leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Senior Assistant at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ sty outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adapt to an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CE@@ T on Thursday
death protection at Delta State University left ap@@ ology
following the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry for the first murder , &quot; he said , &quot; he can undo it , &quot; stated authorities on Tuesday .
police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer on geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot on someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency department that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give it .
lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted to undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb transferred 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities told on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ man Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He does not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , he drove his car to the side , ran on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. degree from Delta State University as his standard of life on the University &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm

in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ time partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also allegedly fought with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the company
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1000 leaders will cost the work of the Group .
there are , however , new negotiations with the union union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and boo@@ sts the cheap Euro@@ wings budget .
the aim of the real@@ ignment to be a contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and income syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer any executive board for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the executive team headed by Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt would be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
with the new order , Spo@@ hr highlights the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the company plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the company &apos;s 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with pilots
in the collective conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike .
this is what the union shared with .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement age for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with an predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wanted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will result in results as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the trade union and airline led to a number of strikes over the past few months .
in addition to the interim supply of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; savings concept .
it can be seen that Lufthansa is moving to the Euro@@ wings con@@ glomer@@ ular low @-@ cost line in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this led the left external def@@ enders to cry and exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis Van Ga@@ al hopes that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an el@@ bow .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more quickly . &quot;
related : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the PS@@ V &apos;s defeat
with the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom def@@ enders have an additional incentive to recover until the next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you then hear it is a very serious injury , this is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ dering of Chris Sm@@ alling .
sure David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you &apos;re David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the web site of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or message we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , play instead an ingredient of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the middle of walled city of Th@@ an @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this were not yet susp@@ icious : the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so familiar with the action of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears , how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the curious , trees , Th@@ ought knit@@ ting Once @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , pur@@ g@@ ous entity , &quot; which speaks in the name of trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a down@@ ing street speaker said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s election department .
Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
to push Pakistan in the U@@ AE is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ wards victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bowl and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity on test level , is an option for the attack .
here &apos;s news : Adam Ly@@ th ex@@ cre@@ tes from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that the cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
hopefully , if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further sales for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that didn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team man .
the question of how much time a test hit gets to put its mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and play .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first set Jonathan side@@ ways in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I set high .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances he had before him , but of course this depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of leaving mos@@ ques beside cook , which would give an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , emerged , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed man has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns instantly and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner in the cad@@ res , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him , he really impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that lift their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made some smart supplements at the training station .
the appointment of Mah@@ a Jay@@ awar@@ mer , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the test games could be a master coup .
it is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ches of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as it has played under all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ lah he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the changing cabin can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in tune with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not specify the timet@@ able .
and you must remember that , as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from the UK from the EU ) could gain momentum if the economy is sl@@ ack@@ ening until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ reported ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold Great Britain in the EU will go deeper every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n became the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was fi@@ erc@@ ely shat@@ tered due to Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always on its own , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wants an outside Great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the exagger@@ ated long runs like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will break down a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
so maybe some such ministers may intentionally not plan some useful comments , quite in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to ha@@ sten the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankruptcy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain did not win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be and which EU scep@@ tics are the Oli@@ gar@@ chy of Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the 1975 referendum held by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who have made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were with all his ma@@ dness .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing ro@@ gue , telephone h@@ acking ali@@ ens , and pseudo @-@ nationals who have most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about them , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner .
in fact Mili@@ band was more than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , as Bla@@ ir had set the principle on the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back door to him .
the press never with@@ drew it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly clas@@ ps on my back on Monday in Westminster , I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me anymore - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t strategy of the eigh@@ ties , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe - I express it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wil@@ ful Gef@@ il@@ d of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism anyone can say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary said , &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the sc@@ out was fighting in him not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ nell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all the reports at the conference evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which was reminded of something at the start on Monday what British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined forces by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and described it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal of Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers are writing in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) in order to produce their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco remedies ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained how to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports previously received by the tobacco company Philip Morris International added .
the reasons for selecting members of the board are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarette champions , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the session was also attended by the P@@ he tobacco director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products with most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these compounds or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes served as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that the BM@@ J claims had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what evidence is evidence and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative danger compared to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually at a disease related to smoking and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
with the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not at risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we carry out our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , former head of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for placing public law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard disputed timing settings against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and destinations such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC general manager , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried six years in Channel 4 without success to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs deliver or send programs that are clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I think is not a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least do its production on programs that others don &apos;t do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the greatest possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax financing programmes could be financed even without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for valu@@ ations &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular shows reflect what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public law niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks and they can argue if they &apos;re on their hypo@@ critical missions to justify 4 billion dollars broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcasting fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that for 150 £ a year you get a great value here , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testi@@ fied before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example to the public broad@@ caster in Australia and Canada for example to &quot; inform , clarify and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful on television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically altered nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , used by ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the method of one day could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
gour@@ mets are usually not responding to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani realized that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microsc@@ opic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the wort cells .
the sound waves effect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when ultras@@ oun@@ ds the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the altered mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons by means of light pulses .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ imp@@ eded and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that was around the advertising for the weapons trade - through a lead of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic double @-@ digit corporate advertising but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ei@@ sh with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture tools at the trade fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture tools are not illegal in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within the Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors have fantastic euph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago I moved to a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 year old , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anger@@ ed - and the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrance into student residen@@ ces is ranging from slightly annoying to absolutely sc@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sne@@ ak : people tell where you come from , if and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ year , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ mite do not love or hate because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to even if your lashes were burning and those fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
allow people to .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and community meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress on and adjust their under@@ wear .
related : don &apos;t Thin@@ k to start with a relationship
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space B@@ um@@ mel culture that can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away to keep the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos mo@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by jaw@@ s .
as you start the university at the peak of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked something like you . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to chat and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sit dor@@ man@@ t when you drop .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook internally .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , that &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbours if they had a mind about making the drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter because it was three in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , take care of her , separate herself and see her every day and perhaps experience how she is drawing all together friends together ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your lower abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room lying , the border between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good place is fun , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never ch@@ ew somebody &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water which you put in the freezer - but do not stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling any more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single parents , low @-@ wage ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Mark Gil@@ dner relies on terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the Fran@@ con@@ ian corner valley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees do not need room for living but also the educ@@ ative mother and the servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to make things affordable and good even today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Mark Gil@@ dner believes in knowing how quickly a convenient living space can be created : he builds semi @-@ detached houses for refugees in a project .
Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a great part here .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need enough living space over the next few decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
Gil@@ lis : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when you enter@@ tain people in housing blocks .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily changed according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without plot .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have been implementing my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ wert special construction and the parking space Ord@@ in@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y and cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ represented , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the space missing .
and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ lis : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
this is definitely not true .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ lis : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but luxury apartments were built which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , also ordinary people need housing .
not only refugees but also the self @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the low @-@ wage ear@@ ner .
I show how to build today still cheap and good .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message telling me that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to make room - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able due to the stream@@ lining of the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is finished .
it is worthwhile to make sure your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone could possibly turn half@@ way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton has only one motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second pointed out before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion in front of the night race in Singapore on this Sunday of defending champion and two @-@ tier champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve rounds of the season so far and also won the flood Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 year old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear .
since days a ha@@ ze bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbour island Sum@@ atra .

the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess player and tennis player who has spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur .

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot bring up the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of its connection with the spa town .
Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ büro looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg square .
besides consultations , you can also participate in courses there .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more precisely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new district office recently opened there .
here , in the immediate vicinity of the shopping market , you will immediately receive sen@@ iors and seeking information on questions such as health insurance or health care insurance .
for years now , with our ambul@@ ant nursing staff , we have been finding that nursing relatives are often left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too often many services of the insur@@ ers are not used because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new house@@ wife Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ella and the civil hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the sen@@ iors centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre will see both business leaders especially in demographic change .
this is because this necess@@ it@@ ates a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also devoted itself to the agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite to a regular soci@@ able community . &quot;
by doing so , the Foundation makes a big contribution to ensuring that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment as independently as possible .
the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12@@ pm .

according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
but he was not intellectu@@ ally attached .
Wiese was just cutting his hair in the middle of Bremen &apos;s inner city when he saw a parking space guard out there for his white Chevro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
the meadow burst out of the business , insul@@ ted the civil servant and accused her of the over@@ due fine of the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
in the city of Bremen , the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young boy and struck him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose break and ble@@ ed heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he initially left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpet@@ rator followed the group with a passenger car to their apartment and passed there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
the victim &apos;s face and th@@ ig@@ h were checked with the help of a drum stick .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters large .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been around 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ber ausen .
the Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs , mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert , are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing luck : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ ber ausen on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing with half a job for his successor in the coming months .
after a conversion phase Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the ri@@ ms met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently undergoing their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ber ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time , I just inv@@ oked them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Müller couple liked the idea to practice their own practice in the future in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
currently he is a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Chief Medical Advis@@ or in Di@@ ep@@ holz and engaged in voluntary work on the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice is being prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ber works as a general practitioner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the E@@ DP is completely renewed .
the Müll@@ ers receive a total of 50,000 Euros in the context of a funded program from the county ( 25,000 euros ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come to practice in the field every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another home doctor &apos;s office in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy , according to Ur@@ sel &apos;s field breaks , remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor would have been found , it would have gone too .
by the way , who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s Consul@@ tation , also continues to look at familiar faces : taking over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms of the field .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel says , smiling .
after the long time , they feel a little melanch@@ oly .
&quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see a lot of patients , &quot; says the Intern@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband supplements laugh@@ ingly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself with gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also high on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia has been denied &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - above all in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already highly controlled .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants not to block its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill in its commitments , otherwise the system will not work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby fields of corn .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik is constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly concerned with Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country has some 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Bratislava on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was it that people approached certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we can , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way through Serbia all night long from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary made it , so the police told us that we were to go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary has already been predicted to be a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control capabilities &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional circumstances in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you pass stringent controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country , as far as the standard border controls are concerned .
on Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees will continue to travel to the Croatian border .
on Wednesday morning , the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature birth .
it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still not cleared mines .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .

&quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four big plates each with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want ... &quot; &quot; &quot; .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ic hos@@ pi@@ ce was attentive to its 20th anniversary with this action and is quite likely to be faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and discussions as the volunteers .
while some people spontaneously go to the chal@@ k and talk about &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; can read , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again , there are small discussions about the action , about life , dealing with death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onia plant in Mannheim , which is the carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
it is understandable , however , that not everyone is publicly informed about the tables , but after all it is a very personal matter .
the topic of death and death continues to be frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , such as Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer &apos;s experience , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open up people .

when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was seeking volunteers , she immediately reported herself and was present during the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid is able to deal well with her task and his experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another place , keep it precious and cher@@ ish the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of the mort@@ gage and mour@@ ning companions .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
the pla@@ ques described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ic church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result bl@@ ended , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered his outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell more than 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
despite the price increases that amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January , the reduced view will be effective on 4 January and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ land transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to lower costs , higher revenues and growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achieves solid revenues by considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for the vac@@ ations were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex distributed 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below 2.@@ 44 $ per share , predic@@ ting twelve analysts ordered by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .
six analysts demanded $ 12.@@ 23 billion anticipated .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has experienced a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tization over the past few years , which resulted in sales in his unit of express delivery .
but the boom in online shopping has boo@@ sted the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales of bo@@ d@@ land transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in freight business .
in the market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
at their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the benchmark for the first time in almost a decade .
there is a mur@@ al of the United States threatening above them at the end of the decorated two @-@ story meeting hall .
the map is a reminder that F@@ ed @-@ Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US occupation and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision to be too narrow to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by unprecedented incentive to short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data in the economy show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets might frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal securities - and even just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to avoid raising the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ ling the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently surve@@ yed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rise in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage amount jumped 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they won &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because they would remove the uncertainty of when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als , she expected more economic progress , an increase in the sentence .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world sent together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors were afraid that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would put on the re@@ ins in this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US Federal Reserve .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere suggestion of the former conductor Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , dis@@ b@@ anded confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
member of the Federal Open Market Committee , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated for an increase in interest , made decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite a limited noticeable impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives returned these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place during a severe crisis such as the collapse of the market in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate decision .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of increasing interest because markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should advance the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Life Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany for these days .
preparing a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
even with her 74 L@@ enzen , she still likes to teach .
every Thursday she will do it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different teaching than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ al Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS seeks to elu@@ ci@@ date women how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck on breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively influence the immune system .
the new Am@@ bition of Sports Hall Ex@@ cep@@ tions
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2,3 million Euro @-@ expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited gym@@ nasi@@ um building on the Bern@@ ward Sports Arena is progres@@ sing step by step : in the most recent meeting of the council , the construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
previously , among other things , the Panel had submitted an application for a &quot; legal exception &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ centered first and roof super@@ structure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which for energetic reasons - different from the development plan stipul@@ ated - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan has no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the roof of the roof - but the municipal council is generally rather restric@@ tive in the case of exemp@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gym@@ nasi@@ um structure , however , is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at cost , approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated .
supplements are expected from school and amateur sports sponsor@@ ship .
in the next step , the construction proposal for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now submitted to the Board of the Regional Council for the examination .
clinic P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg Hospital is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the hospital in Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the staff moved from P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will meet on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were implemented , all the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the remaining internal station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job at Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff were informed of the plans .
the change prov@@ oked the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who only has been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who to succeed , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead as of 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and an extension of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised on the In@@ ner Station for gastro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
over the next two years , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree that both houses will lead , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has 35 beds , is to be shut down in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the county has planned this for 2018 when the current rehabilitation is completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board , counter@@ ed rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ rat , is to be used as accommodation for asylum @-@ seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychological iat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity doesn &apos;t come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi Mo@@ ving to Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and very intel@@ li@@ gible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as Chief Physi@@ cian for over 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) was constantly threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example , surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lion are required tonight at 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock in Berg@@ ischen HC .
although the championship leader in the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arrogan@@ t .
in the past season the Bad@@ eners have a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and have something good to deal with .
Jag@@ lad with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their cor@@ n@@ ering on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Wit@@ tenberg ) , several hunters were in action , as the police said .
after a shot , a man of 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought into hospitals .
at first it was unclear how exactly it could come to the accident .
thanks for your help .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rheinland @-@ Pfalz victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in interro@@ gation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave up , killed the youths and threw their body into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missing since Saturday has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and police on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also taken on Tuesday evening , is regarded as susp@@ icious , who , in fact , resist@@ ed the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen had not come home on the eve of a visit to Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first hit personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
when questioned among the friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ rator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the bi@@ ograph@@ er , the police interro@@ gated the authorities in police interro@@ gation , killing 16 @-@ year @-@ olds and putting the body into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought to the dock on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead to the load .
information on the immediate circumstances should carry out the further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing shortage
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable ble@@ b .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens for the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er Wohnungs@@ bau &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany .
thus 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation after the first three months of their stay .
many then come across the housing market and turn to the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers have stayed for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising refugee figures .
the study also makes considerable short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a deficit of housing , which is growing from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0.000 housing units have been missing in the con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations , compla@@ ins Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many professionals lived in big cities emergency @-@ penet@@ rated in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ intentionally longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the l@@ ull on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has fallen again for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction .
so the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dised flats may be suspended .
in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation opportunities are required according to the Alliance .
the programme for refugees shel@@ ters by the Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros were rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
there is practically no escape to Hungary , as more and more refugees are choosing the way over Croatia .
Zagreb has announced that it is possible to pass through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous however .
Croatia aims to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Slovenian secretary of the Interior , and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and belongs already to the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to get there from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports Croatian TV broad@@ caster RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws which came into effect on the same day also make regular asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees do not encounter barriers .
but there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90 &apos;s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Hungary , however , hardly any more refugees come after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
just before closing gates on Monday there had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian law acts as a criminal off@@ ence to overcome and damage the border zone .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed , the southern border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentences were to be sentenced to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; established at the border , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically no one has a view to receive asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungarian opinion Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up with it .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people in recent weeks left at the road@@ side .
scrap skel@@ et@@ ons were disman@@ tled and one of the recording studios in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express themselves with the aim of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reached only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants remained in the country after government declar@@ ations .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy with the arrival after the bridge on Sunday when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor , Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the river Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we only once sa@@ wed the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks .
we said immediately , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to receive a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers climbed from an ICE train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , and after the announcement that the rail traffic was stopped to Germany , they were still trying to cross the border .
the regional train , however , was turned off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Bridge Festival was soci@@ able with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday , the day before a two @-@ bridge course sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of hypo@@ critical politics :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately in building structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially moved the position of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ circle of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bear@@ ers of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which it has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing floods and the coming winter , to create decent conditions for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Conrad has to do his hands full with the support of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad Konrad is accustomed to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to create quarters for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the original tak@@ eover center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Conrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless shel@@ ters in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
all in all , Konrad counts with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 shall provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the state tri@@ bun@@ als .
they would have assured him of creating lod@@ gings for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to help clarify how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , guests are hoping for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of need , it might not be possible for district owners to respect a certain height of the towel rail or the size of the surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he is more successful in terms of accommodation , says Konrad , with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you can &apos;t say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
the Republic does not inc@@ ur any costs , as they themselves explained .
their number of employees want to increase it to three to four .
so far , the search for a district has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container on the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
however , there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for now no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the City of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned are currently unable to take these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability .
the city leader critic@@ ises the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also need to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has announced further proceedings in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there are now the appropriate border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available .
the asylum seekers , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the issue of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; a logical consequence &quot; is a logical consequence of the actions of the Germans , that Austria is now also taking control of its borders .
the nearest Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial Line is officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the listed IT company S &amp; T is set up in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup @-@ companies in the New Wor@@ ft , and later on to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some things : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one @-@ third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second store in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
in fact , Jutta has wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old Li@@ a Per@@ oni owner in the Tau@@ ben@@ market ar@@ cade without further ado : after all , she now gained an increase in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ ing says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that Fur@@ la producers , who were at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a particular location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Grand @-@ area of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has received her fashion interest from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag fall into rap@@ ture can also not answer the professional lady with last security .
perhaps it is due to the fact that a beautiful bag of every outfit is enhanced .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called investors .
some people associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself in a foreign language , journalists are frau@@ dul@@ ent or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls vigor@@ ously the election campaign .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Yorker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the fo@@ eh@@ n @-@ hair@@ do is familiar to many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the Wine Road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to him over -@@ zig verti@@ ces .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous children , which include Tr@@ ump as well as the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to be the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; accidentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the en@@ co@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundations of the real estate group were first land purchases in New York .
but the grand@@ parents &apos; lives were not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descend@@ ant .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather distant from the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so explosive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension expert Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that by Donald , &quot; says the 68 year old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t want the choice , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 movi@@ ego@@ ers , also in the USA aw@@ akes interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park on Wednesday received the award for Sustainable Tourism from the Vice President of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mountain@@ eering Villa@@ ges &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but it did not show any major shifts in the Today articles .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull scored the crash of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ elin , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the down@@ grade didn &apos;t seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise scored an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers among the five major cities , compared with today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number fell short of last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
in August , Today , Today , Today , an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 was completed .
with an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers in September , Sun@@ rise now faces 3@@ 14@@ ,000 viewers at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ael Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without Raf@@ ael Gib@@ ney &apos;s star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ ,000 spectators on average .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ ater will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ lap Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show .

the final three agree : Bachelor of Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets to be revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly obviously who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , when Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was covered with greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may have accidentally checked out who will be the winner .
Sam Wood ad@@ heres firmly to his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers could become a per@@ ishable , who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named themselves - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the whole show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that wood could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ condition@@ ally att@@ un@@ ed to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood was to be chosen , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s b@@ achel@@ or will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 7 : 30@@ pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL spin .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and looks like a wise decision .
some coaches would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a don@@ key as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ bles on Tuesday at its first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was restored in the first game district of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ den and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a po@@ orer start into his N@@ FL spin ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens once , one only takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

because of the high number of refugees , free voters are calling for the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria .
at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn retreat in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get dis@@ courses in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free constitu@@ ents lasted until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
actually , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Prot@@ ected Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as reported during the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W CEO critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards for federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria suspen@@ ds , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 People killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police shot a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i District , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , Senior Regional Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , throwing some of them stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber floors .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately obvious why the rubber floors used , known for being able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the proposed new constitution would l@@ essen their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent disputes since the 10 .
killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very con@@ ten@@ tious issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries .
work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square @-@ square @-@ area .
planned is a mixture of trade , commerce and living - but there are no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market an area of about 4,000 square meters in direct neighbourhood to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city .
which investor in@@ quired , is not yet clear .
no contracts have yet been signed .
the town of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / Street Big Street , already a few months ago and had the building demoli@@ shed .
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the plans for a holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ gli@@ ders are further troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
the stak@@ eholder , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we do not have an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
the ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussions for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ den@@ ers who had come to the meeting called out the images and new details about the hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and the board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a huge block that over@@ looks every other building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , like many other project critics , he fears that traffic will increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; all the bus loads must come , so that this pays off , &quot; says Schulz
what exactly happens on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches online donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a donation campaign to raise $ 11 million to humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees un@@ rolling the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who had fled from Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many fled from war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
report by Yas@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; working with Christian Pl@@ umb
weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily obes@@ e diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take food .
over the years , obesity operations for type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill @-@ obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ble@@ aching - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I submitted to this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
in the meantime , BM@@ I was absent from those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes care approximately at 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was completely dis@@ b@@ anded and partially in 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved by only one percent and , in some cases , only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood glucose level , reflecting the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and more than a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was about obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for people with a BM@@ I of 35 , who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , without an increased risk of death or kidney disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone also added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have gathered these genetic changes that their bodies have strongly linked to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is increasingly considered in fiction : a young woman , un@@ loved and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and falls in love with her .

beyond the love story the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama talked about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is admi@@ rable , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , which can be created for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we need to think about how killing is less@@ ened in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama talked about the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States was a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of ing@@ es@@ tion of hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 per cent increase in the number of children under 12 years , which swallow a strong alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income from disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years who report toxic control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children would drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mo@@ b in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ infection products drink only because of a cheap experience .
young people have pur@@ port@@ edly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ infection products ) are the ones that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange fragrance , which are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
very few sp@@ lashes of alcohol can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning , especially in small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre at the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ as@@ ers from straw@@ berry @-@ fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ants at school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor , who treated her at the winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ent her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had rep@@ elled his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
out of alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with death cases .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
officials from health authorities assume that the product contained meth@@ anol , a fatal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York were planning to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished it from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the disgu@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gun &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and pointed out disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the shortage of competition in Scottish football is boring - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , as there is no title rival@@ ry with the ran@@ gers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic Games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there &apos;s a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will turn things around , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dei@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted Celtic to fight , but the Norwegian boss v@@ owed to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic already had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel the same - but we must go on .
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
coming together is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won anything in Po@@ kal@@ spielen or Li@@ agues , who won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is rising overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million during the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as shown by the figures of the National Statistics Office ( ON@@ S ) .
meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland was 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .
dr@@ unken disturbing the exp@@ ir@@ ation
because the security staff was unable to bring peace , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stor@@ ks into custody .

why I witness an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I &apos;ll see how a man is brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it happens and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I &apos;ll sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew nearer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see directions in the US , and since there are often more applications available than seats , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery is held to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will see it un@@ emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a bl@@ amed me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the det@@ ain@@ ee as he wants , and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
she admitted that she &quot; could have formulated it better , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong , what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ tage from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would owe him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters to whom you can contact .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .
man after a wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to get out of the C@@ anning River
the p@@ anning v@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked about the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few metres from a police officer attempting to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house peac@@ ekeeping incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 c@@ ous@@ ins moved his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol checks and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired natives to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben @-@ c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy states that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the race .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he directed the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ a for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult circumstances when it was about the positive Cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ w trial at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held himself 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like high @-@ hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about that and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted head and I want my owners to think that I will try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had left the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com stating that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eighte@@ en months Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the conclusion that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and maybe makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they now think about it .
but now I &apos;ve come to the point where I don &apos;t care about , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the exercise levels of the coach have been based on Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ standing cobal@@ t investigation , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw out his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ tags @-@ treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the legs of the horse , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my collabor@@ ators mistakenly applied mud on my leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been the same yesterday evening .
it could have been like yesterday the whole day , which was also like that .
but it was also the same on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against rival because of claims related to ring struggles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his players as the &quot; agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co &apos;s coach Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett posted an almost envel@@ oping remark about the Storm team after his team achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game an &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended his team &apos;s T@@ ack@@ lim@@ b and said that they were only concentrating on their contact with the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the critic@@ isms of two leading trainers at his team were confident that they were worried they were worried about being hit by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time and again , I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson talking about ring struggles when they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and that has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this time comes up again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts - St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting your game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a cra@@ p .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
they didn &apos;t think of us six weeks ago when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm vs R@@ oo@@ sters game achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co vs. cow@@ boys .
the playing of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will encounter them in a phase .
the Storm team released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin the next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 on deposit after drug purchase
a man who may have been threatened with a lifetime sentence because of his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released for a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants at the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ threatening punishment for trying to possess a commercial volume of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been out of a harmless background .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 for security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ able declar@@ ations of the two persons , it is clear that the issue of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Serbian pass , log in with the police daily and stick to a starting block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab breaks apart
a truck driver was seriously injured during a collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police said .
the driver &apos;s cab pulled apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone by girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the phone of the girl when this fell asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police looked at it and saw the five images , analy@@ zing computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the search was carried out on the computer by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , and not to appear before court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defense lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; is found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict by October to get background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was given security deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was taken up before the date of the judgment into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
slu@@ gs switch to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are being taken up outside the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ gates were caused by fear of discovery and arrest of people in smaller bor@@ der@@ lands .
out of the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said .
along the border river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and ri@@ fl@@ es to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and for@@ warded to the registration .
compared to the week of the week , the Munich central station significantly increased the number of refugees .
some 700 people arrived in the state capital until 8 : 00 p.m. , a spokesman said in the morning .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the Franco @-@ German border , 17@@ 59 refugees arrived in the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : footh@@ ills of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; waiting in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of stor@@ eh@@ ouses in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area in Western Europe , hot sea air currently flows into the country , divided the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who was pulled over the Atlantic in the past days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , it is still up to Thursday in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ see @-@ reis with bows of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again .
the crowd makes it : every two years the car makers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , it is mainly moving for the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , cars from the compact class are particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Aviation Authority ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available to dealers in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel is entering the top of the world &apos;s largest competitor , VW Golf , which starts at 17,@@ 650 Euro .
the current Astra is available from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA yet on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor , Mé@@ gan@@ e , into the race .
at the fair , the m@@ é@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT @-@ version .
he comes to trade at the beginning of next year , and then as a com@@ bo .
Infin@@ iti : quite new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan depos@@ itor wants to find his position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in addition , a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp is also available .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo@@ charged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s declar@@ ations .
the sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the DS 4 compact class model , which can be seen at the IAA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front panel : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was moderni@@ zed above all , reducing the number of buttons by a touch@@ screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants like the ris@@ ed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human @-@ worth@@ less
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the prison system Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are lod@@ ged in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the victims can even hope for money if they were locked up in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
in this way , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the prison quarters of Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on a free walk , had been reloc@@ ated to a larger cell .
his position of office due to the un@@ worthy conditions for detention against the Land of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin chamber court and re@@ mitted the case for the renewed examination there .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity hurt .
the Court of Appe@@ al now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons from the question@@ able period only a few days of imprisonment for compensation are author@@ itative , a compensation claim was given , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear the protection of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of cash dispens@@ ation .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dge has often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
so they spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
un@@ worthy in 2011 is the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , in addition , the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had confirmed a decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 , also confirmed on Wednesday .

in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come into the head@@ lines for missing personnel .

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming up in Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , around 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated a resolve in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming up in Germany gives the following overview .
according to varying progn@@ oses , between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as before ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all at affordable rental objects : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social dwell@@ ings fall out of the rent budget , and these particularly advantageous apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing needs to be built annually and therefore the federal government would have to invest a funding of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
both scientists and the Federal Building Minister agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in residential construction .

however , the refugees in Germany wouldn &apos;t be asked systematically for their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany there has been a political shift in Germany : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise labour .
while there was a ban on jobs for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence requirement of asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society , too , also because of the shortage of skilled labour - predominantly the view has prevailed that refugees should be allowed to gain access to the labour market more quickly .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses yet .
studies also show that work@@ places are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
for this reason , the establishment of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the Royal Road to Labour Integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees spend their children in the kit@@ as , estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is only very important for the de@@ pu@@ dent parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ Bar , spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators to rise greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for example by allowing more technical schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of knowledge are prepared for lessons .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ uth from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no Federal Land granted asylum seekers or Ged@@ ul@@ les the study - the only exception was hitherto Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studying willing refugees could facilitate access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or toler@@ ation do not get any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law more if they begin a study .
the latter generally do not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ö@@ gi @-@ entitled persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span is shortened to 15 months .
but this funding gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
in the future , Islam will play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually clear the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and develop the existing state church law into a new state of religion .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of newcom@@ ers professionally .
duties also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes prepar@@ edness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to pursue such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be a topic of the whole of society more than today .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination point and a general equality law for a decade .
but it learns very slowly how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and interest groups are demanding for a long time , and why international treaties such as anti @-@ racism treaties Germany commit , must become reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the previously expected refugees , says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what concerns Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needed to flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges to hand out health cards to all newcom@@ ers alike .
provided services could later be rep@@ uted with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to leave so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seekers Act fores@@ ees .
otherwise , doctors make the language barriers possible .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more poorly informed about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in hospitals , even in doctor &apos;s practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
however , many refugees would be helped by more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and in young people it is about HIV awareness .
with some of the other diseases , German doctors come from their training but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so hard to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the doctors , the refugees may even see relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed education system , some of them were even doctors .
however , in order to be allowed to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and , if possible , take place again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill based on estimates of the Federal Psycho@@ therapy Act ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and death fears .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , premature treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z said .
until now , however , only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can apply for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ical workers or doctors who are not trained for the mental illnesses will decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege loads to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new staging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to capture every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sings and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the tile and wash for dreaming .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ e and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current production stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst Family .
the gift for fan@@ atics is therefore in blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ ure cocktail with cosmop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said director Reinhard Pro@@ bst called his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the programme of the cir@@ cus attracts talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent movies , the Cuban duo likes to take up the Cuban duo .
ease and mobility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to capture women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
besides numerous salmon sal@@ ts , cir@@ cus promot@@ ers also fascin@@ ate with finger tips and agi@@ lity .
balancing with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
there is no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little else and fascin@@ ates with its agi@@ lity .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ uses in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst takes a stand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents are enjoying each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , is read by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the man@@ ege .
the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the recei@@ pts , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
for each visitor , something should be there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or more people are watching , we always do our best and with all our hearts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks at his performances from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe Fal@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe un@@ vei@@ ls false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , the el@@ dest guide of Africa , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by statements by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
last month they had bu@@ ked him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity in Parliament ends and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 work@@ places within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will divide into two listed companies and separate computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; is focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; a statement by the company .
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electric systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to tackle the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PC to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused businesses provide better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere ahead of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and where his rehabilitation is going according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer will surely be uncertain at the European Championship .
the great dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had completed the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing back during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten your career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his K@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als in 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight times since 2007 / 08 , which have suffered most of the injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement will last in the injury rate during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a decent period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur this coming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents himself a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to pass by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 matches after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is of the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the previous season with the Champions League Sur@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven from far @-@ off hope , with its management to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : comedy @-@ Show , which teaches us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men demonstrate on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the issue , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a miserable life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man , with the goal of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms discovered that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation domin@@ ates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the nice thing about Friends was that this focus was put on my head .
each character was defined not by his work but by his personality , which sh@@ ined through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when soccer sho@@ cks in cozy arm@@ chairs and the Ross &apos; longing for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold themselves to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff member told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my role for people who feel de@@ pressed and su@@ ici@@ dal is really clear to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status can also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you attend this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the fully re@@ designed backdrop to celebrate the day , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship might make .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria is meeting to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria is making his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game reports and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria ran less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Transpar@@ ent Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A Paris needs a strong start against Swedish master since they not only asp@@ ire to qualifying for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was replaced later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back at ease , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team who held a 2 : 2 draw on the weekend against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was known as the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why , when he went in to Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö @-@ defense , before he passed Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big win , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who beat Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and had a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field str@@ ung a heavy enemy .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in advance .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up with some patches of fla@@ ws and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who only scrat@@ ched in the first half in less than five attempts after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he showed much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria into a shoot , which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans achieved his sixth place of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k from Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into play , and only an outstanding interven@@ ing of Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before re@@ turn@@ table Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi entered a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the skill games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game from them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola preventing change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion champion , four times champion league winner , twice champion league winner , twice champion champion , twice champion champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was standing before the European Championship in Barcelona before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything back then , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this also registered Bayern Munich .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ bl@@ y@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in memory : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann was appointed to the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça entered Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he has got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , the Red out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph in the end .
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown mar@@ ched when it stressed the need for alternative perspectives and in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the filling of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian confirmed .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the character of the harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and she is a s@@ ut@@ te , beaten by her white dog col@@ der .
the producer of Dear White People was nominated for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the film directing rights . Dam@@ on replied that &quot; in the end her direction could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip , writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her variety - that is SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tweet earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured am@@ mun@@ ition .
in February , the singer Prince made a recording of the motion during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record quiet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sports climbing and assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which had just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
for the last task , climbing was part of a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deserved more than $ 10,000 or life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
after the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have a gru@@ dge on that .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt the same if they had revers@@ ed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the filming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past they were once one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to handle over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Dev@@ ils .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon continued his early offensive support when Detroit pointed out three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and enabled three of us .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish strongly this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw at the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely concentrated .
the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit match of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good during ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of seventh Inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ te , and Simon gave his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run in the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double Play
when Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth interior , wall created an R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ h@@ ander , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit emerged as the start of the game of a still un@@ mov@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two sessions against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted by the injury list before the game after he had been missing more than a month because of a back .
&quot; obviously not the start I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch da in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman , Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z introduced Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the runner in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ ano followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers settled in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony Go@@ gh at 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor .
he did not beat very well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch Count , scored no points in the third inning , before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
Hu@@ gh@@ es came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : tiger &apos;s R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was retired due to a violation of the wor@@ ds@@ manship .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z Sh@@ oul@@ der in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August , is supposed to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is stri@@ cken from the crash site to launch the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at 4 starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been ste@@ aling his right hip wrist since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three matches at the Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be defeated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden was sharing on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they are then to be distributed over to other communities .
over the past ten days alone , according to the pres@@ idency of the government pres@@ idency , the pres@@ idency of Gie@@ ßen had reached 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that resol@@ ute thinking about military options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective elimination . &quot;
four years ago one was glad that the cup of a military involvement in Germany passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschland@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid locally for the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria once again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV broad@@ caster ORF , no one will be returned to Hungary .
Germany too did not send back any refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s been agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not name concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days tens of thousands of refugees passed through the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary to Austria .
their goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fa@@ y@@ mann applied for a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee influ@@ x in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel on late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Ministers in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those who needed shelter would also mo@@ urn it .
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view has been categ@@ or@@ ically divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous force exer@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to tie the border to Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice cap of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean is sp@@ illing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the moon is therefore easily stag@@ gering on its way around the ring planet .
although this motion is small but too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) on Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; journal .
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , that sp@@ ew water vap@@ or and ice particles and feed the so @-@ called Saturn ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to do without an offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ama already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich &apos;s Li@@ ons , the diagnosis &quot; presumably four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think about it now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive weapon .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ oz Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training after his conc@@ ussion .
the Austrian national player should start running on Thursday already on Thursday .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie got injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent clas@@ h at the head .
but , contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious bl@@ es@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slender lines are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them are B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. How@@ ever , however , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support ten@@ don , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements earlier this year to be prepared for the Christmas business .

on Wedn@@ es@@ days and on the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n partly blows with am@@ per@@ age through the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front , which brings heavy ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a drop of temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong southwest current .
on the side of the Alps , on the night of Wednesday , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys .
the F@@ öhn blows from 60 to 100 km / h in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with bows of 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land with over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can reach in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the alpine ridge .
rain starts here , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours , more than 100 litres of rain per square metre have to be calculated south of the Alps , this after large quantities of rain have already fallen in the last days .
on Thursday morning the air dri@@ es out , as a result , a cold front rolls with strong , partly thunder@@ ous rain from west to east via Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind re@@ fres@@ hes up strongly to stor@@ my , and the temperatures clearly go back .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees in the north , whereas in the south on the weekend it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on Wednesday was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested from the work community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded of Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often only live in secret their faith in the city of Pop@@ es over centuries .
in a symbolic way , it becomes visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a welcome sin ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions should have reinforced him according to historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then began the split@@ ting up of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated the Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Bible , which is now published with glorious pictures .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has been preserved by the 75 year old - which is by no means in@@ significant with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , it can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
cycles which focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments , or fa@@ therhood are created .
this means that he immediately fascin@@ ates several partners : this is true for the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpre@@ ts the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today , in Current Links &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
embedded between Martin Luther &apos;s original scrip@@ ture and one set of the artist , who puts his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old thus allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , who was born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to stop working , and perhaps also to bear with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to bring art back to more value in fast @-@ moving time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is shaped today by advertisement , and that is loud .
symbo@@ lis@@ m is displaced .
artists have a different mood and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images , let them work , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old , I did not care to complete the Bible completely , but also selected the mysterious subjects for him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here we are dealing with the images , the text merely explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn is approaching .
plans are made , place found , companies commissioned , Erd@@ hü@@ gel studied for a round course : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was already over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration caused a dr@@ unken mess , especially with those who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill de@@ ported , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to inform the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ches a clear sign on the weekend .
football re@@ acts to the p@@ onder@@ ing situation in Germany and ensures its help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say that this doesn &apos;t matter , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach , head of DF@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the Chancellor &apos;s Office next Wednesday and meet the Chancellor Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football League has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Federal Li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they are printed on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports editor Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football feder@@ ations , no , we have to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig talked about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license distributors had started their own projects in their locations would be great .
just as magnificent is that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent will be lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the association , together with the S@@ DF and the German federal government , will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the clubs have already sum@@ mon@@ ed the whole set for 2015 , &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach .
reports : SAP Chief of Directors loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the Board of Directors of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bled , p@@ opp@@ y , and then dra@@ gged him out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t is able to pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ one can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ substitute pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...

constitutional Complaints ( BvR ) ( Number of result : 1 )
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we cannot resort to him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga soccer match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its stem position on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change to the go@@ al@@ keeper &apos;s position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller introduces the place of reference book Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller arrives in all Europe @-@ league games in the future , however , Tu@@ ck@@ les left open .
with high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ sche statement by fellow players R@@ eus , that the final campaign for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League must be the goal , considers middle @-@ field players Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; with that Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robotic cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t addressed a &quot; new mobility era &quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the issue with his counterpart from the G@@ 7 states , which will also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid rise in digital radio communications .
a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently underway to test new technology .
in order for the driver to &quot; no additional liability risks being br@@ ushed , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework conditions &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to use international technology to increase the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees people as drivers .
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver gets more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite this , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just ahead of 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the issue of liability in accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the Germans still see their cars scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey carried out on Wednesday at the A@@ AA survey by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing organisation Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent do not count at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents accounted for up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the United States .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital band Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
at least 15 percent of the traffic could be imagined on the motorway , 45 percent in traffic .
every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis tournament
according to the present state , the Düsseldorf @-@ based company will only be able to beat the cover from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision should be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to pick up the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf at the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsored walk in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the drop @-@ down list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was ste@@ aling , and we have become Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world @-@ ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , amongst others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits became the big star of the fashion scene - and with it that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; en@@ f@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung it is fortunate that fashion designers changed his initial reluct@@ ant attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was on the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition was a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely surviving work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed total artwork for which a lot of effort was carried out : to modernis@@ e the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was especially engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the cre@@ ators bar@@ red 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather trousers out@@ fitting with cor@@ set .
Christmas meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion designs by the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he wore his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course I bought them .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
custom@@ ize your jewel - P@@ lau@@ en tip as a fashion niche
in the past it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered materials and lace were created in a large amount for customers who , for example , re@@ worked them for ceilings and she@@ ers .
this alone is no longer working , &quot; says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ deli@@ er P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , the fashion is important again .
in the early days of the pr@@ el@@ ude , fashion played a major role , was then pushed out by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt lists some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , leaning on past styli@@ stic pieces , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile branch in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they are already doing half of all orders .
mo@@ zar@@ dry P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ en lace and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they may wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade almost no longer exist .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
in the Asian region , the bulk commodity is manufactured much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , export is weaker , current to Russia and the USA .
there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have been leading a seal of quality which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ik@@ es .
to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter rev@@ amped the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine is sti@@ cking small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gold@@ smith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ en lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewellery .
in an elaborate procedure , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of lau@@ ren lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies in the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in pl@@ ums and surroundings and who want a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not supposed to touch , but Disney still dar@@ es to watch a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws are still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already firm : Rob Marshall , recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was charged with the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and pushing forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leadership Group has adopted a number of policies including a negative list for regulating the access to market , relaxation of border controls politics , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the resident reporting system .
a negative list is created following the statement that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is important because it points to the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more open , &quot; said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policies vis @-@ à @-@ vis foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier .
the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also included Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double the level of mercury in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus increase the consumption of consumers with a significantly higher dose of the ven@@ om .
the Consumer Organization Food watch , who has a corresponding EU working paper , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mistaken industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf &apos;s mid@@ t from Food@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons , &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury , that at the basis of the still valid limit values , approximately 50 percent of the cat@@ ches must not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ ably .
in exchange for this attrac@@ tiveness , according to Food@@ Watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
food watch , however , described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries , such as car@@ p are usually so low @-@ charged , that they already comply with the anticipated high levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sin@@ king of Kl@@ einf@@ o therefore is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction which helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is greatly enriched in predat@@ ory fish above the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts of especially in un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of the Environment stated on its website with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily targeted by the burning of coal into the environment .
according to written information by the German Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired power plants reach more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as river Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and comprehen@@ sively over@@ stepped &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF last year .
