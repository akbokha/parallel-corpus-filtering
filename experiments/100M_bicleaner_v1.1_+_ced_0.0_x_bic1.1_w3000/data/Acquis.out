in such steps , the Council , in what measure has been obtained by the applied security measures , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security .
at the request of the Organization , Community or State , consultations on issues arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention are examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes , a statement of the Council pursuant to Article 19 or a procedure concluded by the Council shall be settled in disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of this Convention , and which shall not be settled in the negotiation path or by another by the Organization , the Community and the States , on the request of a party of arbit@@ ration , consisting of five arbit@@ rators .
the community and the States ap@@ point two arbit@@ rators , the organization also identifies two arbit@@ rators , and the four so called arbit@@ rators elect a fifth who will lead the chair@@ manship .
if the Community and the States or the organization have not named two arbit@@ rators within thirty days of the request for an arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization may seek to ap@@ point the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rators .
the same procedure is applicable if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected in thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organization , the community and the States concerned .
a ) This Convention occurs for non @-@ nuclear states , the contracting party of the contract and members of the community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is not@@ ori@@ fied that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and
II ) if the community of the organization is not@@ ori@@ fied that it is able to apply their security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organisation , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change in this Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The General Director immediately teaches all Member States of the Organization from any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
a ) This convention takes effect on the day in which the organization of the Community and the states receives the written notification that their procedures are concluded for the entry into force .
B ) This Agreement remains as long as the States Parties to the Treaty are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Agreement and the Protocol together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the agreement is to set the procedures applied in the implementation of the Part I provisions on the procedures to be applied as required .
the purpose of the preventive measures set out in this agreement is the timely discovery of the dis@@ sem@@ ination of significant quantities of nuclear weapons for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other core bla@@ sting bodies for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence of such a de@@ fle@@ ction by the risk of early detection .
in order to enrich the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , composite with the spatial integration and observation as important complementary measures .
the technical completion of the examination by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone , the material quantity not shown for a certain period of time speci@@ fies the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out their verification , the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the Community .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Core Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
when applying their security measures , the Community shall make use of the methods and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , envis@@ age how they are drawn closer and purpos@@ eful in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the amounts of preserv@@ ative , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock removed core material and inventory ;
B ) the assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the assessment of measurement uncertainty ;
( C ) procedures for determining , evaluating and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) method to evaluate accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and report system showing the core material stock and the changes in this stock , including the one - and outputs of the material balance zone , for each material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the hed@@ ging activities according to this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , is introduced into the states , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material with , unless it is introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material that is suitable for composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ lan enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other preventive measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The safety precau@@ tions envis@@ aged in this Agreement are termin@@ ated for core material under the pre @-@ requ@@ is@@ ites mentioned in Article 11 . however , if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not deemed possible or desirable , the organisation and the community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ arding measures envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the pre @-@ requ@@ is@@ ites mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the Community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
at the request of the community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures following this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material if it is used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ trac@@ table , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the community , the organization fre@@ es the core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this agreement , of these security measures , provided the entire material amount liberated by this article in the States is at no time more than
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special fol@@ dable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fifth square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0,@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if liberated core material is to be processed or stored together with the core material that is subject to the securing measures after this agreement , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are taken on that material .
the community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which in the extent necessary for the successful and effective exhaus@@ tion of the duties of the organization according to this Convention , in particular determine how to apply the procedures specified in the Convention .
supplementary agreements can be expanded or altered without alter@@ ing this Convention in the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements come into force at the same time as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to force these agreements into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the integration between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organisation presents a consolidated inventory of the entire core material underlying the securing measures of this Convention in the states , irrespective of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory directory on account of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation )
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource transfer problems .
C ) The aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound up within six months after the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed execution and management of this agreement and the funds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the E@@ EC Organisation has presented a table that is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization arran@@ ges a special account under the name &quot; special interaction account &quot; which is composed of the funds that the Member States will contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as the &quot; Administrator &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ tors of the member state , which are to be paid in the currency of the relevant state to order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the depos@@ iting point of the organization in the respective country .
B ) Payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may make payments before the aforementioned dates .
the administrator , according to the usual procedure of the organization , takes about proportional drawing on the cash or the school notes in order to cover expenses for the special loan and balance the special transaction account in a reasonable manner .
in the granting of these loans , the administrator can , according to the terms of the E@@ EC , deri@@ ve from the following factors :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ advantageous ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly re@@ payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral proposal ) , irrespective of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices that are valid , approved and administr@@ ated for the above @-@ stated objectives of the organization under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the means of the special action account must not be used in place of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has been approved by the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special re@@ payment loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions , which are generally applicable to the organisation &apos;s development loan ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in ten years in the age of 50 .
special Ac@@ tivi@@ sts are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
payments to pay this charge are to be paid directly to the organization that maintains it .
each special loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the source of the funds is stated in particular .
the proceeds from each special loan can be used for expenditure in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator has set at the time of the loan granted , may be recipients of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments from a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the administrator will inform the E@@ EC about the projects and programmes approved by the directors in order to complete all transaction loans .
during the period of the pay@@ out of the special transaction loan , the administrator will inform the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this purpose .
the administrator transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the termination of the financial year of the organization a detailed account statement of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization on this account statement .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC tran@@ sm@@ its a detailed account of the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid in the account , and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are evident .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the Administrator up to the full issue of the means of the special action account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or plans financed through special interaction transactions and all other questions related to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the E@@ EC and the organization may be agreed upon , the agreement and all arising obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due .
if the total sum of all the special acts received by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all arising obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC according to the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the General Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat holds these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication on the proper authorization of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement will be effective and enter into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization .
this agreement is made in two tran@@ scripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wor@@ ding being equally authentic .
considering that the agreement in the form of a letter of letter to the amend@@ ment to the App@@ endi@@ x A of the protocol No. 1 is to be concluded between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T en@@ acted the following UN@@ C@@ TION :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE nuclear community called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large experimental facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are entrusted to a Common Company pursuant to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Common Company J@@ ET . &quot;
Switzerland has been concerned with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
since up to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is still extensive work , it is in the interests of the contracting parties of the present agreement to sum@@ mar@@ ise their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research , which have gained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement is intended to enable every contracting party to take advantage of the possible benefits through a merger of their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for the research work , i.e. the cost @-@ competitive electricity generation by using controlled nuclear fusion reaction .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this Agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programme . &quot;
to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is expanded or altered by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Convention , that it may include new activities relevant for the Eur@@ atom programme .
each time the parties accept a new program , this will take place in App@@ endi@@ x I and II to the present agreement .
the association planned in par . 1 is realised by : - reasonable participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programmes of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom programme ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the programmes .
as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project .
in view of the association agreement envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement , the Parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Con@@ tract , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States , or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme .
with the same objective , Eur@@ atom assumes that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange with the time of entry into force of the present agreement , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ ality Exchange . &quot;
with regard to J@@ ET &apos;s participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the present agreement with the Common Company J@@ ET whose constitution accepts it .
furthermore , Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland &apos;s contractual partner may become a contract partner whose aim falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts signed by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with the implementation of the association provided in Article 2 Section 1 of the present Convention are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
in particular , the association agreement fores@@ ees the suspension of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- monitoring and directing the development of the research work to achieve the best possible results in line with the goals of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used as part of the Eur@@ atom Programme - herein@@ after called &quot; VG . &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task with respect to all research and development activities on which this agreement relates .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and arran@@ ges its T * strength in the interest of the two contractual parties to the common objective established in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme as well as to the common objective stipul@@ ated in Article 1 of the present agreement , and the scientific and technological developments in the world must be taken into account .
according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will ap@@ point one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are looking for it .
the groups of consultants who submit the VG research proposals in view that the funds approved for the Eur@@ atom program provide the best possible scientific results , take this task in respect of all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement .
in the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories .
the Committee of Directors , who has supervised the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and who is responsible for making optimal use of the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the programme , will provide this task with respect to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement .
in particular , it provides the best possible deployment of the personnel and the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss programme .
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the sessions of all coordination committees deployed within the Eur@@ atom programme .
the coordination committees , which provide appropriate proposals for the use of the funds , the personnel as well as the knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , will assume this task in the respective area with respect to all research and development work , which fall under the present agreement .
the BA@@ F is a representative of every member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country responsible for nuclear and energy research .
at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission on the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as the preparation of future programmes and defining their overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the area of fusion .
the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Committee of Directors , the Consulting groups and the coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character .
the opinion of the VG for the urgent actions is mandatory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two parties are working on the works of all technical advisory boards or all administrative committees , which are created for the purposes of the present agreement .
according to this agreement , Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme is set annually to an amount equal to the contribution of Eur@@ atom &apos;s gross domestic product to the total gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution relates to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Company as soon as it is established .
moreover , Switzerland has transferred an amount to the Common Company of J@@ ET , which is to be determined according to the financial provisions of the stat@@ ute of this common company .
the financial contribution made by Eur@@ atom to finance the works in the context of the association agreement and the agreement on human resource exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the works carried out on the basis of the corresponding contracts .
the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year at the beginning of the year , which is intended to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the relevant year .
the Federal Council is paying the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
the other payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are specified in Anne@@ x III on the present agreement .
Switzerland takes all necessary measures to ensure that Eur@@ atom of duties or other duties as well as import restrictions and restrictions are exemp@@ t from the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement .
in this country , the objects acquired or purchased there may neither be freely utter@@ ed in this country nor free of charge , unless otherwise approved by the Federal Council .
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to sal@@ aries and suffer@@ ers who are paid to these individuals .
the provisions on the access to the knowledge intended for the association agreed in Article 2 Section 1 of the present Convention shall be governed in Article 14 and 15 of this agreement , in the association agreement and in the agreement on personnel exchange .
the provisions on the access to the knowledge that apply to Switzerland &apos;s participation in the Common Company J@@ ET are regulated in Article 14 of this agreement and in the statutes of the Common Company .
the right of every contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an essential part of this agreement .
- the exchange of personnel among the participating laboratories in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries ;
- appropriate consideration of companies in Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and the associated third countries when awar@@ ding contracts to carry out the two associated programs according to the principle of the best possible utilisation of the amounts employed .
the knowledge gained during the validity of this agreement in Eur@@ atom and associated organs in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics will be communicated to Switzerland and the individuals or companies that are able to justify access to these knowledge under the same conditions as the Member States , persons or companies of Eur@@ atom .
the knowledge gained in the research activities within the framework of this agreement in Switzerland will be communicated to the Member States of Eur@@ atom and the associated third countries , as well as individuals or companies operating in a Member State of Eur@@ atom or an associated third country research or production activities that justify access to these knowledge .
the Parties shall share this knowledge of other states , persons or companies only if a corresponding agreement is made between the parties , unless these persons or companies in Switzerland operate research or production activities that justify access to these knowledge .
if the knowledge acquired under section 1 and 2 of this article is protected by patents , these patents may be used by the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated third countries and the persons or companies located in the countries concerned , for research purposes in pursuit of the aims of this agreement .
the Member States of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland , the associated third countries and the persons or companies located in the respective countries may be granted licenses or sub @-@ licenses for the use of these patents for industrial or commercial purposes , as far as the parties are entitled to grant such licenses or sub@@ lic@@ ences .
the knowledge arising out of the activities of Eur@@ atom , associated organs and Switzerland before the entry into force of this agreement will be made available to the States , persons or companies with whom the knowledge recorded in Section 1 and 2 is necessary , as far as this is necessary for the use of the knowledge designated in these dig@@ its .
patents applied in this number will be made available to the States , persons or companies that can obtain a license or a sub@@ license to the patents mentioned in paragraph 3 of this article , as far as this is required for use of these licenses or sub @-@ licenses .
these articles are not affected by the rights assigned to the invent@@ ors or their legal success@@ ors according to the respective national law .
the Parties shall see from any action which could imp@@ air the pat@@ ent@@ ability of the in@@ ventions , resulting from the activities mentioned in the paragra@@ phs 1 and 2 of this article .
a mixed committee will be appointed with the term &quot; fusion committee Eur@@ atom / Switzerland , &quot; the representative of the Commission and representatives of the Federal Council .
it checks all measures by which the cooperation can be improved within the framework of the agreement and keeps on the current state of the work .
if a party of the party considers that the other party of the party does not have an obligation under this agreement , Eur@@ atom Switzerland is irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ably aware of it .
Eur@@ atom / Switzerland &apos;s merger committee may pron@@ ounce recommendations on the basis of the VG opinion , which will be communicated to the relevant authorities of the Eur@@ atom countries and Switzerland for the adoption of the programmes and household plans in the research areas .
the presi@@ dency is represented altern@@ ately by the parties in accordance with the Rules of the Eur@@ atom / Switzerland Trade Committee .
the Eur@@ atom / Switzerland merger committee meets at the request of one of the contracting parties , at least once a year .
disputes relating to the interpretation or application of this agreement shall be submitted at the request of one of the two parties to the arbit@@ ral tribunal .
the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal referred to in paragraph 1 of this article is case @-@ by @-@ case .
each party ap@@ points a member , and these two members determine a third member , which perc@@ ei@@ ves the presi@@ dency of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court .
any contracting party bears the costs of its own member in the arbit@@ ration proceedings ; the cost of the previous seat and the remaining costs are borne by both parties .
it appears in force when the parties have told each other that the necessary procedure has been carried out for this purpose .
this agreement will be concluded for the duration of the Eur@@ atom programme named in Article 1 ; it will be tac@@ itly extended in accordance with other relevant application sequences of Eur@@ atom .
if such additional program resolution passes , the extension for the duration of the new program , which occurs at the place of the Eur@@ atom program listed in Anne@@ x I , is considered not to be termin@@ ated unless it comes to delays in the adoption of another Eur@@ atom programme .
before each decision on the adoption of a new Eur@@ atom program , the parties are consul@@ ted within the framework of the present Convention in the articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Convention .
any party party may termin@@ ate this agreement at any time with a period of six months .
in the form of a letter to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in order to simplify the process of adapting duty @-@ tari@@ ff names in the event of renewed changes in the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff of one of the parties to the parties in the future , it also appears that in the agreement an article 12 has to be recorded .
I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and suggest you as an appointment for entry into force 1 . January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the preceding .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the preceding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands as part of medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deliver@@ able funds of the member countries .
already now , however , there are some conditions for which the BI@@ S would be prepared .
with each stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without it being exceeded altogether for five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as for their extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing should not be made prior to the end of a month following the conclusion of the Stand@@ by Agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draw would take place in the currencies available at the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that were to be dealt with taking account of the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those employed by the BI@@ S at the time on similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S needs to provide the required funds on the market itself , the interest rate at the application could be reached by a maximum adjusted to the Libor margin .

in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I honor myself to refer to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
within the framework of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat from Argentina to the community are set to the following annual quantity : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina comm@@ its itself to ensure that the amount of the annual amount does not exceed the agreed amount and is executed according to the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the form of offer become possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before introducing such a change in the Committee mentioned under the number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .

the import duties for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account under the number 5 Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ satz of the de@@ ple@@ tion .
the total amount mentioned under number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 23@@ ,000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community meets provisions to prevent the sales of frozen meat from frozen meat , due to the execution of the regulation , not under@@ mining the sales of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual use of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of ho@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as slaugh@@ tering particular living sheep and lam@@ bs , are only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and , in particular , corresponds to Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
in particular , Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that there are quantities export lic@@ ences specified in this Agreement for the products listed under the number 1 .
in its turn , the Community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent on the submission of an export license issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government .
the details of the application of this system are stipul@@ ated in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the question@@ able products can be wai@@ ved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in implementing provisions , the competent authority of the competent authority of the Community at regular intervals is informed that the export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these data may be determined by country of destination if necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the committee is responsible for the fact that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
he regularly reviews the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including conditions that are of importance for the goal named under number 7 .
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are executed under the agreement not named tari@@ ff numbers after the community .
the Committee discusses all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends suitable solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified under number 2 is valid for the period from January 1 to August 31 .
the amount applicable from the entry into force of this agreement until January 1 of the following year is determined in relation to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal character of the trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a deadline of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before the 1st of April 1984 with regard to changes that it considers necessary to be necessary .
I would be grateful if you would share the consent of your government for this .
I honor to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wor@@ ding :

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat

in recognition of the fact that the sheep industry and the export of hammer and lamb are exist@@ ential after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , and that the normal paragraph of New Zealand &apos;s hammer and lamb is not affected on these markets , I honour myself to propose the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
according to this agreement , New Zealand is granted access to the Community market for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat in the amount specified in the agreement .
new Zealand gets the assurance that the normal paragraph of his hammer - and lamb &apos;s meat is not affected by the application of the regulation .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is obliged to ensure that the amount specified in fact does not exceed the set amount .
the prescribed amounts are carried out in traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the Community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position on the market of the community .

taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual use of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of ho@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as slaugh@@ tering particular living sheep and lam@@ bs , are only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these products .
new Zealand ensures compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 in particular because it does not grant export licenses beyond these amounts .
in its turn , the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand is dependent on the submission of an export license , which is granted by the competent authority notified by the New Zealand Government .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all blood samples tested that contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or any other substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or appar@@ itions may not appear : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined by double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated solely to the volume of the flow of blood cells in the total volume .
in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at present standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ffer , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ ents in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ und@@ ations .
the ti@@ ter gives the re@@ agent di@@ lution in the final mixture within a series in which a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which International standard preparations are present ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the Tit@@ ration of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International Standard Prepar@@ ation or a State Stand@@ ing Prepar@@ ation in International units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B sh@@ ears contain 256 international units per ml according to definition .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the date of exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the feasibility studies ; it is approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container , in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose a maximum of 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des under pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ vents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the conditions for specific@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , whether in liquid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for blood group determination determined for international exchange should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least as long as not until an international agreement has been established through a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to perform tests with the unknown blood cells but also to perform tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records about all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
adequate samples of all given re@@ agents are to be stored for a long time from the laboratory until a certain likel@@ ihood can be assumed that the char@@ ge is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective portion in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
every single container is a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , in case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of liquid needed for re @-@ dissolution ,
furthermore , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers , contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
