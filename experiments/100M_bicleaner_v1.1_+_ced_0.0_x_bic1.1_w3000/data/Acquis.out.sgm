<seg id="697">In order to enrich the target defined in Article 28, material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance, composite with the spatial integration and observation as important complementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical completion of the examination by the organization is carried out by an explanation, in which for each material balance zone, the material quantity not shown for a certain period of time specifies the accuracy limits for the specified megen.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their verification, the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the Community for Core Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">When applying their security measures, the Community shall make use of the methods and measures of the following kind and, as far as necessary, envisage how they are drawn closer and purposeful in the supplementary agreements:</seg>

<seg id="724">If liberated core material is to be processed or stored together with the core material that is subject to the securing measures after this agreement, precautions for the re-application of the securing measures are taken on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements, which in the extent necessary for the successful and effective exhaustion of the duties of the organization according to this Convention, in particular determine how to apply the procedures specified in the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="726">Supplementary agreements can be expanded or altered without altering this Convention in the agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements come into force at the same time as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention. the organization, the community and the states undertake all efforts to force these agreements into force within ninety days after the entry into force of this Convention; an extension of this period requires the integration between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62, the organisation presents a consolidated inventory of the entire core material underlying the securing measures of this Convention in the states, irrespective of its origin, and continues to carry out this inventory directory on account of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation)</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) The aim of the EEC and the Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound up within six months after the entry into force of the agreement, and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the organization have consulted each other about the proposed execution and management of this agreement and the funds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the EEC Organisation has presented a table that is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization arranges a special account under the name "special interaction account" which is composed of the funds that the Member States will contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement (in this capacity the organization is referred to as the "Administrator"), and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest debtors of the member state, which are to be paid in the currency of the relevant state to order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the depositing point of the organization in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment is made in two installments, namely i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator appointed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Any Member State may make payments before the aforementioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">The administrator, according to the usual procedure of the organization, takes about proportional drawing on the cash or the school notes in order to cover expenses for the special loan and balance the special transaction account in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans, the administrator can, according to the terms of the EEC, derive from the following factors:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without disadvantageous; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly repayable development program or project (including a sectoral proposal), irrespective of whether it is part of the organization's loan program or not, according to the procedures and practices that are valid, approved and administrated for the above-stated objectives of the organization under letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The means of the special action account must not be used in place of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which has been approved by the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special repayment loans are subject to the same repayment conditions, which are generally applicable to the organisation's development loan; they are therefore refundable in ten years in the age of 50.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special Activists are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Payments to pay this charge are to be paid directly to the organization that maintains it.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each special loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the source of the funds is stated in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from each special loan can be used for expenditure in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or provided in a Member State; ii) in developing countries, the members of the organization and which, according to what the administrator has set at the time of the loan granted, may be recipients of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments from a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The administrator will inform the EEC about the projects and programmes approved by the directors in order to complete all transaction loans.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of the payout of the special transaction loan, the administrator will inform the EEC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the termination of the financial year of the organization a detailed account statement of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external auditors of the organization on this account statement.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC transmits a detailed account of the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid in the account, and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States are evident.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the Administrator up to the full issue of the means of the special action account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or plans financed through special interaction transactions and all other questions related to the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the organization may be agreed upon, the agreement and all arising obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total sum of all the special acts received by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement is repaid and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all arising obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC according to the procedural rules of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The governments of the Member States are notifying the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned.</seg>
<seg id="764">The Secretariat holds these notifications together with a Notification on the proper authorization of this Agreement by the EEC to the organization.</seg>
