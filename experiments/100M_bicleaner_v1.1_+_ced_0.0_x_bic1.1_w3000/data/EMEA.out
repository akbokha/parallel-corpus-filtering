this document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. s@@ wir@@ l thought and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a psychological disorder in which the patients have alternating episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ tuning ) alternating with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
for both diseases , the solution may be used to take or melt tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this affects signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells to one another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works primarily as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole works like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree than the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mitter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize brain activity , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing her recur@@ rence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study involving 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest with the one of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment was examined .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution to take away ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than the patients receiving placebo .
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes previously treated as placebo for up to 74 weeks in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ bili@@ fy are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( monitored at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , se@@ dation ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , tre@@ mor ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes responded to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , out@@ weigh the risks .
in addition , the Committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution in quick control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the marketing of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mostly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ conduc@@ tion ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , consider reducing the dose or breaking the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS or has un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly in relation to the deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , respectively an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed .
with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ) Met@@ aboli@@ sm , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metaboli@@ tes .
if you consider the joint gift of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefit should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the Dos@@ ish@@ öhe before starting the companion therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with A@@ bili@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate increase in arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
this medicine may not be used during pregnancy due to insufficient data for humans and concerns caused by the animal &apos;s reproductive studies unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - A controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total reduced incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study , over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of 3@@ 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients suffering from Hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study , over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ ion .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ doses with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is medi@@ ated with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine dy@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2 and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in dosage of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and put@@ amen .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared with placebo .
in a Hal@@ operi@@ dol controlled trial , 52 of respon@@ dents &apos; response was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rates , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , comprising 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal of &apos; weight gain &apos; was , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dos@@ ages of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a versus placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients suffering from a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ulation is cataly@@ sed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l for extensive metaboli@@ tes via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ tes via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
there was no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with varying liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not identify any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in case of dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ reno@@ cor@@ tical toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10@@ times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was also detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans ( mg / m2 ) .
however , in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is medi@@ ated with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine dy@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , comprising 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal of &apos; weight gain &apos; was , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dos@@ ages of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were compared to 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans ( mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to increase the resor@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under circum@@ vent@@ ing of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ ut therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy processed tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for taking .
there are no studies on efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which have been different from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or loss of blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for people with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ conduc@@ tion ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were used as non @-@ recur@@ rent intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; metabolism , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metaboli@@ tes can result in joint use with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the Dos@@ ish@@ öhe before starting the companion therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared with the after sole injection of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials with or@@ ally applied Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo .
in another 12 @-@ week study , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ ion .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significantly greater improvements of agi@@ lity / behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms regarding the agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agi@@ lity , a similar efficacy was observed with regard to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined by a decreased patient number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared with placebo .
in a Hal@@ operi@@ dol controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ dents who attended the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study objectives including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions@@ News@@ Scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % of placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , comprising 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal of &apos; weight gain &apos; was , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients suffering from a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study , over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ op@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection than tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and did not result in any direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration of a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns arose after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not identify any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in case of dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times of mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters earlier an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
considering only those patients who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drug efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
it must also not be applied to patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ enz@@ enes in the blood before or before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients in which the first treatment was not more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and that in contrast to other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel medicines , it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in the case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted until improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with impaired ren@@ al function were carried out and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with impairment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in the case of patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ cytes has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et count has increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity clearly associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is not proven , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in case of nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea following the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not exercise effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to testify during and up to six months after the treatment no child .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm con@@ served , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the ability of transport and the ability to operate machinery .
below are the most common and most important incidence of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was fast reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported to 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 contains the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and there was no caus@@ al connection with these events .
Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is an optim@@ ising mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active ingredient that promotes the cohesi@@ on of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by blocking their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and within the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel by the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and a pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( cream rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ linked studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised Phase III study .
in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel every 3 weeks , either in form of solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel 175 m@@ g. / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 . the results for overall response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity towards Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to ab@@ ound at bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
the active ingredient exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous injection of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft tissue binding of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in a study with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel were compared with the values of a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane injection ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ based pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and two smaller metaboli@@ tes ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ ex@@ ation of the un@@ altered active substance was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metaboli@@ tes 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and in light of light over 8 hours .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogenic medicine and , as with other potentially toxic substances , caution should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , the sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution .
after complete en@@ core the solution should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good moist@@ ening of the solid material .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug which has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called the &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ sen@@ sing values in which complications could occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood donation is not possible before the intervention and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to have an own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron levels of all patients must be monitored prior to treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency , or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby dimin@@ ish the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was inserted , enabling it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in a major study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference drug remedy .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between 25 and 29 .
in addition , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of stre@@ amed out below the skin stre@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
it may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
stre@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treatment of kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in accordance with the European Union standards the evidence was provided that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a approval to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ce P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is based on the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in planned major surgical interventions that require large blood volume ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
in order to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic intervention in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected loss of blood of 900 @-@ 1800 m@@ l. which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients where the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and consequences may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the evaluation of individual clinical course and disease condition by the physician is required .
a rise in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in one patient over or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ inv@@ ari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value rises by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied at the lowest permitted dose , which is required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
the clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in whom initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical findings suggest that patients with an initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than those in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by means of an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and - follow @-@ up symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of individual clinical course and disease condition by the doctor is necessary .
given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ inv@@ ari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied at the lowest permitted dose required for control of an@@ emia symptoms .

patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned patients is required should receive a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible , for example , a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation .
patients who develop under treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin on an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a Ab@@ se@@ amed or any other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lis@@ s ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not able to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion , vascular disease of car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recently acquired heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the revers@@ al cycle value should be determined and the usual causes for failure ( iron , fol@@ acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ a toxic@@ ity , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the reci@@ pro@@ cy@@ te value is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ - and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason for a loss of effect is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti@@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 Pati@@ ents with chronic kidney failure should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in maintenance therapy .
in clinical trials , increased mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed if ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control an@@ a@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of hypertension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart disease , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
according to the present knowledge , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for greater electrical orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially for underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glo@@ b value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been shown to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy , a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
about th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , lung em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m , an@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically @-@ derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and in relation to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients with an@@ emia due to various common malign@@ ancy consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than with controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and associated complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and with controls satisfactory .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results relate to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa cl@@ auses following repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly longer half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .

prior to the market launch and by agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of approval for the market has to supply the medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Training brochures • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging supplement . • With clear picture of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transport through the patients .
the holder of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 is set up and functioning in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. the drug vig@@ il@@ ance system is set up and functioning before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the drug used in traffic is applied .
the holder of permission to apply for marketing is obliged to carry out the studies listed in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan and additional measures relating to pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance , as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) specified in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , as well as in accordance with any subsequent risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for tweet products for human use . &quot;
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • receiving new information that might have an impact on current safety specifications ( safety specification ) , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures • within 60 days after reaching an important ( drug vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) mile@@ stones • by request by the E@@ MEA
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke in a month before your treatment • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time , or increased chest pain ) , the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis in veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) is , for example , if such a drop of blood has occurred in the past .
you suffer from severe bleeding disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which re@@ forms during further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to regularly check the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of the treatment .
iron deficiency , dissolution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or follow @-@ acid deficiency should be considered and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed before starting the therapy .
very rare ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a was reported about the occurrence of an@@ tigen @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an an@@ emia due to a kidney disease .
a high hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value could be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
with increased or rising levels of potassium your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present knowledge , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be very carefully weighed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if there are already th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurring in the past ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis or lung em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed looks like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can affect the tumour neg@@ atively .
if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood graf@@ ting after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have used / used / used other medicines , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory studies have not shown any interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular intervals between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after the surgery .

when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the fridge and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used or rejected within 3 days .
it is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones brit@@ tle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture such as falling down ; • Disease Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 I@@ U ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for treating the disease Pa@@ get may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood again or at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with elderly women , the risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without oste@@ opor@@ osis edi@@ c@@ ents ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
in comparison to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
Ac@@ la@@ sta manufactures re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains clu@@ es on how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended for two or more weeks following the surgical treatment of hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment by Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and juven@@ iles under the age of 18 , as data on safety and efficacy are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia can be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , usually occurring within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
for patients who need dental procedures , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan for each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse events reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall incidence of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which , as a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases , expressed acute ren@@ al failure .
the change of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing ( measured annually prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as reduced ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days of the application was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels were found in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the disease @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a recently diagnosed hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical trial , local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , were reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was occasionally reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area at one with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in the case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by means of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ 0.@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric flu@@ idi@@ zed frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 years and older had a reduced risk of 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density at lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ c acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of bone density of lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.@@ 0 % , of the fem@@ oral neck by 5.@@ 1 % and dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology With 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic ridge .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume compared with placebo and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
bone graf@@ ting markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periods of study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the ac@@ la@@ sta treatment compared to placebo treatment increased BM@@ D at all times .
the treatment led to an increase of BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % on the total air and 4.3 % on the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als over 24 months compared to placebo .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % for Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( Study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was not subject to the weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at relative to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly mild to moderate @-@ severe disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with the 2,@@ 6@@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg cin@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months of comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the 6 @-@ month main study ( responded to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained with 141 of the patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 of patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , in a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ phase van@@ ishing from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ a 0.@@ 24 and t ½ to 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early phases of distribution ( α and β , with the above 2 ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the given dose is found in urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total @-@ body clearance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of 5 to 15 minutes of in@@ fusion was reduced by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration vs. time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing of the substances that are metaboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolic inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing , and in the 64 examined patients mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a light ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function disorder down to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
since severe ren@@ al function disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is limited , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ perfor@@ ated intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies of dogs , single doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C should be 6 times the recommended humane @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous use , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats was administered in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the 7@@ fold the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure occurred in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most common finding in repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metaph@@ or of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive action of the substance .
in rats , a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity of doses from 0.2 mg / kg was observed as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and skel@@ etal ab@@ norm@@ alities .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium level .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .

according to the CH@@ MP Directive on Risk Management Systems for Human Use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect current claims on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was achieved .
z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , above all est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is set up un@@ ordered , making the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing bone reconstruction , ensuring a normal bone formation and rein@@ forces the bone once more .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently been taken / used , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , you are concerned that you have sufficient liquid before and after your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if you miss the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before termin@@ ating the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta Falls you are considering termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or at the jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves rash and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not listed in this manual information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to carry out the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta patients must be adequately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic progression @-@ free hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
A@@ compli@@ a is also applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or about or • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and furthermore one or more I
in addition , four trials were carried out to more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive means of setting smoking .
on the other hand , studies on the setting of smoking did not show any consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what is associated with A@@ compli@@ a ? the most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a , observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were nausea and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable in concur@@ rent use of A@@ compli@@ a with medicines such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means of use in HIV infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ compli@@ a in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight

compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data for efficacy and safety .
La Depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
it is also possible for patients who - apart from obesity - have no recognis@@ able risks , can lead to depres@@ sive reactions .
relatives or other nearby persons ) must be noted that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke , etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ out@@ . l@@ n

in addition , patients suffering from obesity have been examined and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in additional indications .
the following table ( table 1 ) shows the adverse effects associated with treatment in placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients who have been treated for weight reduction and related metabolic diseases .
it was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding placebo rate ( for adverse effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG For the evaluation of side effects , the following frequencies are based :

5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of the following unwanted effects not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area , were assessed as potentially relevant for clinical use :
in some , but not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or menstru@@ al distur@@ b@@ ance .
the impact of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on the pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , a exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic medication ) is not shown .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in in the highest tolerated dosage .
in combination with a sulph@@ onic resin or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better used and the blood sugar level decreases , allowing type 2 diabetes to be adjusted better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin , in addition , they received up to 3.5 years either ac@@ tos or placebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of supple@@ menting Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin showed a 0.@@ 94 % reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values , while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ i@@ ology ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or any of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ tos across the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under the age of 18 , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated output liver enzyme levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal discomfort , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , the liver enzyme values are to be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters have been established .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can stir up fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
a slight reduction of the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on as oral two @-@ fold or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , patients with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ onen , including pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , have reported a decrease in visual acuity during the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ onen , including pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report on disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of un@@ desirable events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures with 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be removed ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies to investigate the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ex@@ erts no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on dimin@@ ishes the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia associated with pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for red@@ dening growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not appreciated from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the lens and index of refra@@ ction , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic drugs .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege went beyond three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as under placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was 1.6 % higher than in placebo , if pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , but more often when pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the treated groups .
in the Pro@@ Active study running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures with 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
at intake of the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not occur .
pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ ic@@ ome proliferation ) activated by the activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued for two years to study the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the start of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar had been insufficient with insulin despite three months of optimization were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo .
in patients under pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continued to receive only insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was observed .
in clinical studies over one year pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as in@@ significant but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced overall plas@@ mat@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d , and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was found under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , while decreased values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial heigh@@ tened tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both of which effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ized in groups who received either pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in plasma can usually be reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy is equivalent to three times the effectiveness of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it could be proven that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ex@@ erts no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radioactive Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in humans , the marker was found mainly in the resin ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma el@@ min@@ ation period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and all active metaboli@@ tes are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and its metaboli@@ tes are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clear@@ ance of the parent substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies mice , rats , dogs and monkeys occurred following repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on dimin@@ ishes the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in the gest@@ ation and increases the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for red@@ dening growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epitheli@@ um were induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons resulted in increased frequency of col@@ on tumours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures with 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study more than two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial heigh@@ tened tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was missing the target for its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on does not involve cardiovascular long @-@ term risks .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been enrolled in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar ( the full list is taken from the packing supplement ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weighed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly , for example , by an intensive insulin therapy , can be used to change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin @-@ animal origin ) may result in a change in dosage required .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal to human insulin , reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions in therapy and always ask his patients for medicines taken by them .
4 Un@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of de@@ form@@ ities and fru@@ stration in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias may lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es , ending with temporary or permanent disturbances of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy A quick recovery of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 . intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar setting may be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
disorders of the skin and the lower tissue tissue Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection site can develop a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if missed to change the inser@@ tion points within the injection area .
local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) .
disorders of the immune system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ ot@@ ic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and impotence / un@@ consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , however , can gradually develop : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral intake of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an un@@ approved sper@@ son or by glucose given intraven@@ ously by the physician .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of work is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sur@@ es ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metaboli@@ tes formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans .
it is recommended to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not over 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded in accordance with the instructions for use .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal to human insulin , reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the fast acting insulin must first be raised , then the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for treating hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients undergoing major surgical procedures has shown that a 42 % reduced mortality rate ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) was reduced by 42 % .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration of work is approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .

proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • knock a few times with your finger easily against the cartridge .
when air bubbles are present , you will collect them up in the cartridge • While you continue to keep the injection needle in the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure B ) • While the injection needle continues to show up , press the push button in fully ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Now , a drop of insulin must be extracted from the tip of the injection needle .
• Pu@@ t the cap back to the finished pen so that the digit 0 is opposite the dosing stamp ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Control whether the press button is pressed completely .
if the push button cannot move freely , the insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the closing cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves outward while you rotate the cap • The scale under the push button ( push@@ button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Record the highest number you can see on the press line • add the two numbers to get the adjusted dose • If you have set up a wrong dose , simply rotate the cap forward or reverse until you have adjusted the correct number of units .
turn them until the push button is at the bottom and you can feel a resistance . then take the cap off and put them in such a way that the 0 of the met@@ ering brand is opposite .
make sure to press the push button only during the injection • Ke@@ ep the pressure button pressed after the injection , until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
it may be in@@ accurate • You can not set a dose higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual scale scale to assess how much insulin is left , but you can not use it to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already seen signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or rheum@@ atism ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger deposits of urine , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per deci@@ liter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment , rheum@@ atism may still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic have yet to use other medicines to prevent rheum@@ atism .
the medicine is not recommended for children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medication ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used at a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose levels of urine acid in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients received aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took 120 mg once daily , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood , aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to deposits ( including one of the medical records known or currently present , and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum res@@ ale level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
for patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents Sin@@ ce there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the use of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other di@@ ure@@ tic medicines , it can lead to acute toxic@@ ity during the treatment , because of the lowering of the serum resin column , ur@@ ic acid deposits can first be mobili@@ sed in the tissue .
for example , in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so much rising that there is a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight differences in liver function were observed in patients treated with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ treatment and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ B did not perform any in@@ efficiency studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhi@@ bit may lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ine ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with an increase in f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at may be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active substance applied at the same time .
in a study involving subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x a medium 22 % increase of the AU@@ C from Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that simultaneous consumption of ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful in controlling a vehicle , operating machinery , or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported was observed in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events that could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * No severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed in clinical trials .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years treated with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( A@@ PE@@ X study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients with the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value at the beginning of studies of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the A@@ PE@@ X study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the usual dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the serum resin level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and permanently maintained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cre@@ atine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The A@@ PE@@ X study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( D ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decline of serum acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ aric acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in the open extension study in Phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of serum resin acid levels at &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in incidence of rheum@@ atism ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against rheum@@ atism ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ ail , which results in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the top not@@ ches until month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ g / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at were increased by administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in the AU@@ C is observed for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking single or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration , provided that this was examined ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plas@@ map@@ le binding of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding of alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s , these oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ modified f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 3 % ) .
besides the ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as un@@ modified f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ µ@@ g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ µ@@ g µ@@ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of special Pur@@ in@@ Met@@ aboli@@ sm and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
at high doses , for example at 4,@@ 3 times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which accompanied by lowering the incidence and development delay in the descendants of rats .

21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years treated with f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients with the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data collected in the open extension study in Phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of serum resin acid levels at &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in incidence of rheum@@ atism ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against rheum@@ atism ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a condition where bones are brit@@ tle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment , patients with low vitamin D levels were lower ( 11 % ) than those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those treated exclusively with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that indicates that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose required for preventing bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( intestinal disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cers ( swal@@ lowing ) , abor@@ ted abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) and aci@@ dic re@@ pris@@ als .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it must not be used in case of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. for the transfer of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following tips are to be followed exactly to reduce the risk of malign@@ ant irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or take the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not sit before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B . pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all the signs and symptoms that indicate any g@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out in the appearance of symptoms of malign@@ ant irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and obtaining medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to use it after symptoms that point to malign@@ ant irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , often ( after market launch ) Ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , commonly associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men mainly administered intraven@@ ously bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available that indicate whether a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate treatment in patients who need a max@@ illary surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the treatment plan for each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned at the intended week of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE prior to treatment .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for the use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy nor by breast @-@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , absorption of serum calcium was up to &lt; 0 mg / l ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6,@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur h@@ al and 7.@@ 8 % on the chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % versus placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the percentage of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to hold ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. a day , either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption Be@@ ared to an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fast@@ ings and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to a clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies of rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after an intraven@@ ous dose of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After the intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance selected within 72 hours with the urine was ex@@ cre@@ ted and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fa@@ xes .
after intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs through these transport systems .

characteristics in patients prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the percentage of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
in patients with reduced ren@@ al function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see Section 4.2 ) .

an@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted by a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , whereby the application was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter studies on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were carried out and investigated , as Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .
tre@@ mor ( trem@@ ors ) , headache , nausea / vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of blood ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be used .
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( in particular some herbal ) can be taken concur@@ r@@ ently with adv@@ enti@@ f as the dose or dose of the concur@@ rent medication needs to be adjusted accordingly .
hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ ans yellow @-@ orange jel@@ ly capsules , printed in red ink on the bright yellow capsule top with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under the closely mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be maintained .
the dosage of adv@@ enti@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level measurements ( see below ) Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ mirrors should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after switching .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post@@ transplantation phase .
because Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with a low clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ f can take several days until the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral intake of medicines , the intraven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) can be initiated with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adap@@ tations can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - Li@@ ver Transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust a gra@@ ft recipient of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules converted to a once daily intake of adv@@ enti@@ f , this conversion has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ enti@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must commen@@ ce for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplantation In adult patients who are converted to adv@@ enti@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ enti@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ectal gra@@ ft patients , was used in a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in case of an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in case of intestinal transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood age levels in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cre@@ atine level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ lear@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f In case of switching from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is caution ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level of blood in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of full @-@ blood Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ king controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ king levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ enti@@ f , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances which could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments can take several days until the steady state has occurred .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the levels of the blood in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in whole blood are usually carried out in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and ni@@ ft and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or regime should be performed only under the closely mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be refrac@@ tory compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ arding formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f are available .
in order to prevent gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data for the ret@@ arding formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f are available .
the use of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) is due to possible interactions that may lead to reducing the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s clinical effect .
a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea since the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus have symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disorders , a radi@@ ological examination should be ( e.g. ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ ans , lac@@ tose are present in patients with rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special caution is required .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or lower blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while simultaneously administ@@ ering substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; hence , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone levels , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va , an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy exists .
in uter@@ o exposure , it is recommended to monitor the new@@ born to possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of a premature birth ( &lt; weeks 37 ) and a hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the secondary efficacy profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not exactly determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the concur@@ rent treatment with a large number of other medicines .
below the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How known to treat other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ mo@@ sis including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment were reported .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may be convey@@ ed by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the nucle@@ us .
this leads to a calcium @-@ dependent blocking of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymp@@ ho@@ om@@ ic genes .
Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymph@@ oma ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ centre study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported to over 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ans occurred in 2@@ 1,7 % compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients being switched from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ans@@ - syndrome in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
Pank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted in 205 patients who received a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t , which received Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
color@@ ectal transplantation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ tations showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this can be concluded that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done via bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in case of stable patients ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ king levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood co@@ agulation disorder due to lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether lawyers are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was inserted into which it enables the formation of the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the drug to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures has been studied .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ents in the prevention of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new bleeding periods with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ents may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the marketing of lawyers across the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the Factor VI@@ II deficiency , after the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the case of the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the VI@@ II @-@ activity factor should not sink below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) to repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
during the treatment course , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma gas is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to Factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. by factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II @-@ plasma activities are not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the Factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered .
the speed should be adjusted after finding the patient , and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II , Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma with modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ trim ) inhibit@@ ors was observed in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tic known inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) who performed all previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of forming inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected decrease of the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ der occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed again sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or ( ≥ 50 days ) was detected .
in previously untreated patients an ongoing clinical trial comprised 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE versus Factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ tres against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the scope of the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a co@@ of@@ actor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of the X @-@ factor X activated factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE were performed on previously treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basic value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 100 previously treated patients , or &gt; 10 years and are listed in Table 3 below .

special care when using A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE is required you should inform your doctor if you have recently been treated with Factor VI@@ II products , especially if you have developed inhibit@@ ors .
these symptoms can be early signs of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic shock that may include the following symptoms : extreme di@@ zz@@ iness , loss of consciousness and extreme breathing difficulties .
if you are taking other medicines , please inform your doctor if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
your doctor will charge your dose A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE ( in international units or I.@@ U. ) depending on your physical condition and body weight , and whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding .
patients who develop factor VI@@ II inhibit@@ ors If the expected factor VI@@ II receptor cannot be reached in your plasma with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE or cannot be controlled , this could be due to the development of factor VI@@ II
associated with surgery cath@@ eter infections , lower number of red blood cells , swelling of limbs and joints , prolonged bleeding after removal of drainage , decreased Factor VI@@ II @-@ M@@ irr@@ ors and post @-@ operative hem@@ at@@ omas .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE &apos;s safety profile that requires a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , that the authorisation holder should apply for a further extension procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited informed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially stating that the company receives its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
however , the breast , brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
it is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been modified so that it cannot produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body usually helps restore damaged DNA and kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer appeared in the area of the sub@@ structure , in bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the examination of the initial documents submitted , the CH@@ MP will create a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumours benefits patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ modi@@ ty @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nose passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents 12 years old , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy was the changes in the sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the start of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
if only swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c substances or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug used to treat allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who suffer from a narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular diseases including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) or a ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( stroke ) or a risk of a ha@@ em@@ mor@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe to authori@@ ze the transfer of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease with time during long @-@ term use .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy .
since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after termination of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , di@@ meth@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ ot@@ amine , dex@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiva , which are per@@ or@@ ally or nas@@ al as ab@@ s@@ sive Rhin@@ opla@@ sty ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data does not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked for patients with kidney or liver function and the data does not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment with hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache or strengthening of headache ) must be dismissed .
treating patients with heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder hal@@ ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to be dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent .
in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test there were no significant differences between the patients treated with the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , no matter whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is not inhibit@@ ing in vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor characteristics of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
the patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness which may lead to impairment of the mu@@ ti@@ lation or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S @-@ stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible sequ@@ ential processes .

CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesive molecule P sel@@ ectivity on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in an individual dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage can cause further li@@ ke@@ able effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 took part in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equivalent of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects , four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metaboli@@ sed .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to the gift of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n could not identify any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ology studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , run@@ ny or it@@ chy n@@ oses and drow@@ ning or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
20 In certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous membrane of the s@@ wollen drug pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is included in this medicine .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ si@@ tic ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer , leading to nar@@ rowing of stomach , small intest@@ ine or es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a closure of the stomach outlet or the du@@ oden@@ um ( bow@@ el closure ) , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ ms in the history of the lungs , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnos@@ ing the following symptoms or diseases using aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure • Al@@ ch@@ asing , pal@@ pit@@ ations • ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as disorders • nausea and headache or strengthening existing headaches .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken medication , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
usage in the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or atten@@ de@@ es the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not indicated in this manual information .
heart hunt , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulty , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves rash and swelling ) or rash .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspic@@ uous liver values was also very rare reported .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup respectively .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies involving about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by determining the changes in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rant , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks treatment .
further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body utili@@ zes sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us led to an average decrease in the symptom score ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in the two trials at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared with placebo @-@ treated patients .
eri@@ us must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the previous disease progression and can be termin@@ ated after the symptoms have been cancelled and resum@@ ed .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended for patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were noted in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , the performance reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that it may occur in very rare cases which may lead to impairment of the transport capability or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported in placebo reported ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was headache , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ time clinical dose ) .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ sel@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval appeared .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes , as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of ae@@ ti@@ ology , is similar in different forms and chronic patients can be rec@@ tified in a simple pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all of the caus@@ al diseases , it is expected that in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rant at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and being awake significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where patient demo@@ graphics were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in vi@@ vo not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n could not identify any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and there are no data available to support an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
for about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n metaboli@@ se and experience higher substance loading ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children aged between 2 and 11 , which is fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who eat normally .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , which is why patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ som@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were noted in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , the performance reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall incidence of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group like the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children between 1 and 11 years old , who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval appeared .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents found no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in case of an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not interfere with psych@@ om@@ otor impairment .
in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not result in increasing alcohol @-@ induced performance impaired performance yet to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

the pre@@ valence of this limited @-@ metabolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the si@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation following daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose trials , AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .

there is limited experience in clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melt tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and placebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .

the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the placebo group .
in small children between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo reported diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , a non @-@ recur@@ rent dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was observed to prevent side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 .
in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents found no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect the flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that is supposed to protect against a strain of the influenza virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus occurs , which can easily spread from man to man , because humans have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to form antibodies in a contact with a flu virus of this common ancest@@ or .
subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as a foreign body ) was removed , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been investigated .
as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked the anti@@ viral drugs used by the patient before , and the likel@@ ihood is that the virus will respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day and with other anti@@ viral drugs .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
as@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs and keeps them at a low level .
however , the damage to the immune system and the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS cannot delay .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the medicine A@@ gener@@ ase , which was prescribed with low dose , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or alter@@ ation of viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the amount of virus , but only very few of the children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medication A@@ gener@@ ase reinforced the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase came together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the viral load after four weeks compared to patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
as@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are broken down as well as as@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines against HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ juven@@ ating immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years versus the risks associated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Ampli@@ fier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee found that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was presented at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for the marketing of as@@ gener@@ ase across the European Union .
as@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , am@@ gener@@ ase caps should be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase caps and solution for taking one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be taken with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
as@@ gener@@ ase should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the ing@@ es@@ tion of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , am@@ gener@@ ase caps should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of an anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing limited liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ sed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al gland function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
for patients who use this medication at the same time , as@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if also low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases requiring medication to be associated with the development of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ ous patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic lati@@ tude may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in an attempt to balance the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often adverse effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already receives St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50 % increases , compared to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and in Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment schem@@ as .
52 % hum@@ bled when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r concentrations in plasma , which have been achieved twice a day in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study for use of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the analogue component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
this is why in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z combined with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised , as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma gas .
caution is required when these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is advised to reduce the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concur@@ rent administration .
simultaneous application of two daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ MA@@ x from ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ grade ) to 2.@@ 69@@ x compared to the value that was observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that can be listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines , if used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to degradation of the plasma gas of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and ampli@@ fy the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to increase the plasma levels with simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicinal product with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended until stabili@@ zation of the mirror , since the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if also low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment how the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose is to be adjusted if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with concur@@ rent administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with concur@@ rent administration of as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the em@@ placement in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during the breast@@ feeding period .
further development of seed including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase Treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to the treatment ab@@ rup@@ tion .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or other drugs used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg as@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ al sub@@ cut@@ aneous fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ k@@ al fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean period of 36 weeks , only one case ( bull@@ fights ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 trial , in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin rash was usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases have been reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resident opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg as@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable with those observed in patients who received as@@ gener@@ ase along with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary support measures .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral ga@@ g and ga@@ g polym@@ ers with the result of a formation of un@@ mature , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ mer concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhibit@@ ing HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ st@@ erte treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously treated patients , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 trial and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
prototype interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing Klin@@ isch vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretations can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic samples associated with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally maintained .
there are currently data on cross resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 fossi@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients ( one of which showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
premature termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults following vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ submission threshold of 0.4 logical copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 was pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase was used for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ gener@@ ase should be considered during therapy optimisation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral dosing , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50 % increases , compared to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake was influenced by the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r representing the active part remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 / or inhi@@ bit a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate must be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than the capsules ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not re@@ plac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , hence the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes result in am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those on healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in doses that correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after two daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , which included bacterial reverse mutation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
in clinical studies , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure that was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be done with care in patients with low or mild liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50 % increases , compared to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r concentrations in plasma , which have been achieved twice a day in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z combined with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would lower .
caution is required when these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , at least half of the recommended dose is recommended to reduce the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with concur@@ rent administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,@@ 0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the em@@ placement in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during follow @-@ up .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary support measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ mer concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 / or inhi@@ bit a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate must be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; hence the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in doses that correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ zel@@ ul@@ lar aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young the metaboli@@ sation path@@ ways are not fully mat@@ ured , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking into account is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking into account was neither approved in patients receiving PI , nor with PI receiving patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase caps and solution for taking one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily highest dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ col@@ ge@@ content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
concur@@ rent administration may result in a competitive in@@ hibition of drug metabolism and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( Z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be stopped for a long time if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in h@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ ous patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50 % increases , compared to C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
on the basis of data to 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significant higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . general solution for taking into account may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the prop@@ yl@@ eng@@ ly@@ co@@ l contained in pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the em@@ placement in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight during the breast@@ feeding period .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or other drugs used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ st@@ erte treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
premature termination of a promising 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large sales volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

the frequency of application and the duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • For patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is carried out five times a week for six weeks .
before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to apply to the affected areas of the skin so that it remains on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies involving 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ ec@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream continues until all visible asc@@ ents have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal@@ ic@@ ular area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
in case of follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions are not completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should re@@ plen@@ ish the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapeutic plan .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and in the cleaned , infected skin area , until the cream is fully dra@@ ined .

in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a stri@@ ction leading to circumc@@ ision .
in an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ations ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have also been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experiences have so far been available to apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ Cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied remedies for the treatment of external inclin@@ ations in the genital and peri@@ anal@@ ges@@ ic area .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of cow@@ l reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of cow@@ ards .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not investigated .
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream .
if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment period of several days can be done .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as there is currently no data available for long @-@ term treatment rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in case of super@@ fic@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experiences in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application in pre @-@ treated tumours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have less chance of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip@@ stick .
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis in anatom@@ ical locations outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally take place in the course of therapy in intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream .
if the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 les@@ ions showed a lower complete cure rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fo@@ etus development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) can be obtained neither after one @-@ off or repeated topical application , no recommendation for use during breast@@ feeding can be given .
the most frequently shared and considered likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in connection with side effects in studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most frequently reported and considered prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream associated with side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream from a placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trial reported side effects below .
the most common , as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the side effect were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ Cream treated patients with acute ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine Cr@@ ème is common to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ k@@ ori@@ ation / de@@ fl@@ ing ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) and ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the test plan , evaluation of clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cr@@ ème extremely frequently resulted in serious ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sc@@ oring and sal@@ utation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was determined with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area .
accidental unique oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia norm@@ alized after or@@ aler or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , systemic levels of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies showed that efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the cow@@ ardi@@ s during I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
in 60 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the patients healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
total healing was achieved in 23 % of 15@@ 7 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tumours were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fic@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients had been clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free time period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ easy scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications external inclin@@ ation , acute ker@@ ato@@ sis and Super@@ cer@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or weeks ) .
a minimal systemic inclusion of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ ome was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated obvious half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study , indicating an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ fic@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; a study carried out for four months for der@@ mal application yiel@@ ded no similar effects on the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with der@@ mal administration on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumors at the application area .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for the human being to be regarded as very low due to the systemic exposure .
the tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the true @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

the study was mainly examined for the safety of the drug but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me sen@@ sed the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ thro@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review and review all the new information that may be disclosed each year .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in response to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ azi@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ ion id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been identified , and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the In@@ fusion Day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed only in an appropriate clinical setting where re@@ vit@@ ational equipment for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies is immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all Ig@@ G antibodies form antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when applying al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment , there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer inter@@ ruption .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ reti@@ cular ) to minim@@ ise the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
in case of a severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied concur@@ r@@ ently with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data in new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly treated as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breath@@ s and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug interactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with predominantly severe form of course and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the start of the treatment , whereby the patients at the age of five were mostly in a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to early ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not exposed to immuno@@ hist@@ ochem@@ istry ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients , in which there was never a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with missing or low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was observed in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro which seemed to not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely to have man@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient demonstrated the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ ator volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me each week for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared the placebo group to improve lung function and ability to function in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as highlighted in the following table .
the decrease in the anticipated percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically in@@ significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was found , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes spann@@ ed across five efficacy variables ( anticipated percentage normal FE@@ V , range in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of movement of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a 1 @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was conducted in which Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me studied safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics in 20 patients , who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with mid @-@ run form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in Har@@ n in week 22 .
in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was noted after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of course ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle course shape had a normal mental development rate , whereas in the older patients with severe form of course there were only limited or no advances in cognitive development .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ co@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma dosing schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with a unique gift , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .
since no toler@@ ability studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6 .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer drugs ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( to prevent liquid deficiency ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients whose blood @-@ picture changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
converting P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin showed an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , A@@ lim@@ ta &apos;s average survival was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival compared with the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for the marketing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - c@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after gradu@@ ation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following prior chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is given intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift as well as the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) during the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third session .
in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a full blood sample should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose testing must take place taking account of the Na@@ di@@ rs of the Blood Pat@@ tern or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grad 2 bleeding .
if patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value prior to treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or more in comparison to patients at the age of 65 an increased side effect risk exists .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min had no dose adap@@ tations that go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ by limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.@@ 0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality number returns a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et @-@ cy@@ te number has reached a value of more than 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neutr@@ ality , plat@@ el@@ et count and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous cycles of treatment ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was affected when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ - lac@@ tic action to reduce the toxic@@ ity of treated toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing 45 to 79 ml / min ) must prevent simultaneous consumption of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion should be considered before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed when this substance was commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised against the treatment of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the lock conservation .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) may result in reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased incidence of side effects .
caution is therefore advised when high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are used in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed are avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ure@@ tic an@@ timet@@ aboli@@ tes , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be used during pregnancy , except if it is essential and after careful weighing of the crop for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the onset of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm con@@ served .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and were random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients random@@ ized with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity degree 3 and 4 was similar to the results of three P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mono@@ therap@@ i@@ estu@@ dia ( n = 16@@ 4 ) , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine @-@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead back to differences in the patient population as the pha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ eline values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events that could possibly be related to study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSCLC who random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and received 8@@ 30 patients with NSCLC who random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular hypertension , and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in medical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
in clinical trials patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy occasionally reported cases of Co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) .
in clinical trials patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure .
it was reported about cases of acute kidney failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of ir@@ radi@@ ated pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that exercises its effect by interrup@@ ting subsequent , fol@@ c @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed appears as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ yn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are key enzymes of de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ ds .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , easy @-@ blind phase 3 trial of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had clin@@ ically significant advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to those patients who were only d@@ umped with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and worsen@@ ing lung function in the course of time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy showed medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival benefit of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , modified HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , resulting in a quarter of the fats that have been added to the food in@@ gests the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in both trials of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg after one year had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side @-@ effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on anus , Fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ b lab@@ eling , stool , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft stools .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in gra@@ ft patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or ch@@ ol@@ est@@ asis ( liver disease ) , and pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally resor@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in • Chol@@ est@@ ase • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • lac@@ tation period ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since weight reduction can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adjusted if necessary .
patients who are allergic to high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines must be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy prevention measures to prevent the failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with concur@@ rent use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international normal @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta carot@@ ene in the normal range remained .
however , the patient should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure a sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological action of the medicine , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials involving or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the frequency of adverse events reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e individuals over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a quick recovery of any systemic effects that can be traced back to the loc@@ ating properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect continues in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ ischen and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
clinical studies have shown that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at is taken three times a day , blocking absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value : 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg ( starting value of 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , not metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study involving obes@@ e patients , which was given the minim@@ ally systemic resor@@ bed dose , two main metaboli@@ tes , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after split@@ ting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ cine group ) , could be identified which represented nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be recognised any particular danger to humans .
pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 , as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market .

see further helpful information on the blue pages in section 6 , how to set up your cal@@ ori@@ ential and fat del@@ im@@ ents .
if you have a meal or a meal does not contain fat , do not take a capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk food @-@ related side effects ( see Section 4 ) .
in order to adjust your body to the new eating habits , start before the first capsule intake with a calorie and fat @-@ reduced diet .
food di@@ aries are effective as you can understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will likely be easier for you to change your dietary habits .
in order to safely reach your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Nutri@@ ent to low fat to reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional supplements ( see Section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you begin taking the capsules .
remember to consult your doctor in advance if you are not used to physical activity . • Sta@@ y while taking and also after stopping the intake of all@@ i physically active .
• All@@ i should not be taken for more than 6 months . • If you can &apos;t find any reduction in weight after twelve weeks of use of all@@ i , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
you may need to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not about changing the diet at short notice and then returning to the old habits .
• If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not indicated in this manual information .
the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules and result from the fact that more fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects tend to occur within the first weeks of treatment because at this time you may have not consistently reduced the fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related symptoms : • Begin for a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a long shelf life , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with those accompanying symptoms will learn to control them by adjusting their diet .
• Do not store the medicine for children . • Do not store any unused medicine after the exp@@ iry date . • Do not store the container tightly to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with silicon , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow it . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is included in this package .

a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive influence on your health .
select meals containing a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of the packaging of foods . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum a day .
see the below tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
what amount is appropriate for you , refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • D@@ ue to the mode of action of the capsule , adher@@ ence to recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process that amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while reducing the likel@@ ihood of nutritional supplements . • You should try to gradually increase weight .
34 . this reduced calorie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without having frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you do not walk daily , work in the garden or do other physical activities . • &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means you can burn 150 k@@ cal every day , e.g. by 3 km walk , 30 to 45 minutes of gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Alo@@ xi is applied in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is insufficient information about the effects of this age group .
this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three major studies involving 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are severe or moderate nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with al@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with al@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , versus 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an am@@ nesty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or sign of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advised if Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is present with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in cases where the Q@@ t interval is prolonged or which tend towards such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not to be used in the days following chemotherapy to prevent or prevent nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics studied against tumors ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - concentration or@@ alen met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population analysis , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ o@@ dar@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ operi@@ dol , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tral@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron for human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician .
clinical trials were the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with al@@ ma@@ xi ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the performance ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were stated in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage similar frequencies of adverse events occurred as in other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effects relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an al@@ op@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 .
results of studies of moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron were comparable .
after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the goal of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was to assess the EC@@ G effects of a pre@@ determined Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
after intraven@@ ous administration , an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are dose @-@ proportional in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration measured at 42 ± 34 % was measured between Day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value measured after a single intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the single dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metaboli@@ tes , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , the is@@ o@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mg / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous stu@@ b injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were only observed after ex@@ positions seen as sufficient over the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , pit@@ u@@ it@@ ary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is low compared to humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , recommen@@ ding the use of Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicinal product called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is already approved in the EU ( also called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damages damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to stimulate the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that substanti@@ ate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study it was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after setting the treatment to the medication ( i.e. no signs of the virus reported in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients , which responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical trial .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was returning to more patients than with the reference drug ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
in addition , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) , is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ sts formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties ( fis@@ sur@@ es or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ ma may not have an effect against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients at the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo talked to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or by infections prov@@ oked or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the placing place .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go should out@@ weigh the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. approval for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined once again and consider alternative therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation by applying ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as a patho@@ gen ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retin@@ ob@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ ew@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased from 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ ated skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not required if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fo@@ etal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding should be continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy should be continued / termin@@ ated with Al@@ tar@@ go , the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman should be weighed .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go used was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the place of performance that concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ ome inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Centre .
by binding on this binding site , p@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms appear question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to respond to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion on intact and stri@@ ped skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 of the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 de@@ ported skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect the hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix will be applied within the framework of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immun@@ ization and that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be completed .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis C or -@@ B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease .
after a child received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same constitu@@ ents as the vaccine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts , which has been approved since 1996 and has been licensed since 1997 with Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same illnesses , but Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts and Twin@@ rix children are administered within the framework of an existing vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof for applying Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix conducted between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar in a six @-@ month period and a 12 month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals a licence for placing Ambi@@ rix in the whole .
the standardis@@ ation plan for Grun@@ dim@@ mun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , where the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a re@@ fres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies were found in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully ensured that immuno@@ competent individuals who have responded to hepatitis B vacc@@ ination need a re@@ fres@@ her vacc@@ ination as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ed vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , there may be no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels , so that in these cases the addition of further vacc@@ ines can be required .
since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , in case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix may be sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ected , as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influenza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ality , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever is comparable to the frequency observed with the earlier thi@@ omer@@ ase and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the tolerance of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a calculation basis for the Ambi@@ rix vacc@@ ination dose , but not on a basis of calculation per person .
after the administration of Ambi@@ rix , pain was observed at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects following the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the patients who had given Ambi@@ rix had given birth over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the subjects , who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ency was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. , over the whole vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects receiving Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to that observed after the combination of the combined vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines reported about serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 up to 15 years , serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was exp@@ ectable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the gift of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were aged between 12 and 15 years , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vaccine scheme .
the immun@@ reaction observed in this study was comparable to that which was detected after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ atic A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be demonstrated that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the re@@ fres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influenza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates similar to earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ se on possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
according to article 114 of the 2001 / 83 / EC directive , the state charge of charge is made by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in contaminated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require hosp@@ ital@@ isation .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with Hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines , an ino@@ cul@@ ation may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections affecting the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to have a high level of protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the planned second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
with a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before end of the vaccine series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected to persons suffering from severe bleeding disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s def@@ ences / or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the response is to vacc@@ ination .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child will take more medicines / take it ( including those that you have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / has received / has received / or this is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties .
if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgently needed to vacc@@ inate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 im@@ pregn@@ ated cans ) : • pain or discomfort at the bite site or redness • mat@@ ur@@ ation • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 im@@ pregn@@ ated cans ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Th@@ ank@@ fulness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal complaints
other side effects that were reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 im@@ pregn@@ ated doses ) are :
these include locally restricted or prolonged out@@ breaks , which can itch or be bli@@ zz@@ led , swelling of the eye contours and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden loss of blood pressure and loss of consciousness .

23 Find your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you / your child or you notice side effects not indicated in this pack supplement .
ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which have been known since obtaining the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was taken into circulation only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ites - split into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach &apos;s leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) is administered .
it was not a comparative study because Ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ia can also result in loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disorders or taste , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval , limited information about this drug was available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days age ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests after the first months of life ) , an indication of the use occurs when there is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and the development of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ b@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must obtain ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing because there is a risk of the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
because metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat are carried out over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
with a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , the neur@@ onal multip@@ lication was slow@@ ed and the loss of neur@@ ons increased .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted to the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10@@ g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate associated with intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nit@@ ro@@ genous analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , using alternative ways of ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated prior to the initial appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , who recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is known to be oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate for so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis following individual orders as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycle disorders or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable at night after ni@@ ghtly fasting .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted in 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no compla@@ ined effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who cannot swallow tablets yet , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be held within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ b@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rats were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metaboli@@ te of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , les@@ ions were found in the pyrami@@ de cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected 15 minutes after the ing@@ es@@ tion .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
the small measuring sco@@ op is 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon is 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to take the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headaches , fla@@ vor@@ ings , lack of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or your hospital &apos;s emergency room to initiate appropriate treatment .
if you miss the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with varying strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI patients a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) was used , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox was - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was much more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox in the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the marketing of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately before the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous cap@@ tion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bolt of angi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be achieved .
in order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before use and the bolt dose is quickly given intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after termination of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular si@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and / or ir@@ reversible co@@ agulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ ton@@ ia and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , particularly when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if most of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur in arter@@ ial points in the case of PCI patients , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ ona intervention ( PCI ) may occur during treatment in principle , bleeding .
in patients who are using war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din again reaches the level before treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly monitored .
the animal experiments are insufficient with regard to the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , dis@@ connec@@ t@@ edness or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or en@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of point , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding center , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ r@@ cal@@ is@@ ations , which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients who underwent a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above were reported in practice after comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is immediately broken off and the patient is closely mes@@ hed in terms of signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bic inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to both the cataly@@ tic center and the an@@ thro@@ mb@@ in of the thro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or in the cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with serum from patients who had come to he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ sty thro@@ mbo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce a plat@@ el@@ et aggregate reaction .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din demonstrates a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is evi@@ den@@ ced by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was carried out below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to receive a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or upper arm or administered as permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or does not process insulin effectively .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults in type 2 diabetes , where the body is not working effectively .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was noted compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin li@@ sp@@ ro after six months .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin levels .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the del@@ to@@ id muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the abdominal area .
due to reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function .
any change of the active force , the brand ( s ) , the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ arded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirements .
3 A insufficient dosage or termination of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
changing a patient to a different type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the timing of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment schem@@ as change .
to the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympathy oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ dine , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ dine and reser@@ pin , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or absent .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin lu@@ li@@ sin enters into human breast milk but generally insulin does not enter the breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral use .
the following are listed in clinical trials , sorted by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration difficulties , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive dog , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Op@@ ens to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous dose of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with cou@@ gh@@ - and normal insulin levels .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ es@@ tus insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a high dose of proportional glu@@ cos@@ ity , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ity effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has a double as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ ity effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that a similar post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ ounced control than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal , was reached .
if insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
