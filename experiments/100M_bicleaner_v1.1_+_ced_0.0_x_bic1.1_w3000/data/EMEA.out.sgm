<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package supplement (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. swirl thought and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disorder, a psychological disorder in which the patients have alternating episodes (periods of abnormal high-tuning) alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders, if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">For both diseases, the solution may be used to take or melt tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">The dose of Abilify should be adjusted for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this affects signal transmission between brain cells through" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells to one another." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Ariopprazole probably works primarily as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also known as serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole works like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but to a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Ariopprazole helps to normalize brain activity, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing her recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study involving 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest with the one of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment was examined.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melt tablets and the solution to take away (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased restlessness than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes previously treated as placebo for up to 74 weeks in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to lauazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side-effects of Abilify are extrapyramidal disturbances (monitored at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), sedation (drowsiness), tremor (drowsiness), nausea, nausea, vomiting (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes responded to treatment with Aripiprazole, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution in quick control of increased restlessness and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the marketing of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mostly had manic episodes and their manic episodes related to treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration of the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ariopprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ariopprazole should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overconduction), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerized and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, consider reducing the dose or breaking the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS or has unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Ariopprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to undesirable cerebrovascular events associated with Aripiprazl treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to the deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in patients with schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar disorder, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, respectively an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripiprazl by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad') Metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefit should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the Dosishöhe before starting the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are administered together with Abilify, can be expected with a moderate increase in arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazl showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-method xymorphine-ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">This medicine may not be used during pregnancy due to insufficient data for humans and concerns caused by the animal's reproductive studies unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - A controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total reduced incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 13.1% in patients was placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study, over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients suffering from Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of 323.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study, over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-ion.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">CPK increases (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazl compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events associated with an anti-psychotic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdoses with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing because Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole is mediated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine dy2 and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Ariopprazole showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor and a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4, to serotonin 5HT2 and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In dosage of Aripiprazole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at nucleus caudatus and putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Ariopprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol controlled trial, 52 of respondents' response was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rates, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study, over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Ariopprazole showed a significantly higher response rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, comprising 314 patients and in which the primary study goal of 'weight gain' was, significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosages of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Ariopprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, Ariopprazole showed a versus placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazl also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients suffering from a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study, over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization period prior to randomisation, Ariopprazole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydration and Hydroxyulation of Aripiprazl, the N-Dealkyulation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl for extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Ariopprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did the pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">There was no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with varying liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in case of dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Cholelithiasis was also detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans (mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of apes, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3 and 11 times the mean Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="145">To increase the resorption and minimize the variability, an injection is recommended in the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle under circumventing of obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acut therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify processed tablets or Abilify solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with agility and behavioural disorders, which have been different from schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or loss of blood pressure (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution are not available for people with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Ariopprazole should be used with care in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overconduction), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerized and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazole, in a study in which healthy subjects Aripiprazl (15 mg dose) were used as non-recurrent intramuscularly and which at the same time received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">Compared to CYP2D6 'bad' metabolism, CYP2D6 extensive metabolites can result in joint use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the Dosishöhe before starting the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of sedation was greater compared with the after sole injection of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical trials involving Aripiprazl injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials with orally applied Aripiprazl (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients was placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another 12-week study, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-ion.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazl treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">CPK increases (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazl compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Adverse events associated with an anti-psychotic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazole injection solution associated with statistically significantly greater improvements of agility / behavioural problems compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Ariopprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding the agility and behavioural problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- Reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed with regard to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined by a decreased patient number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Ariopprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a Haloperidol controlled trial, 52 percent of respondents who attended the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study objectives including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-DepressionsNewsScale showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study, over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher response rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapine controlled, multinational double blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, comprising 314 patients and in which the primary study goal of 'weight gain' was, significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients suffering from a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study, over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week extension in manic patients who achieved remission with Ariopprazole during a stabilisation phase prior to randomisation, Ariopprazole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC is 90% larger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection than tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level at 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazl injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and did not result in any direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration of a systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15- and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application, no safety-related concerns arose after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazl (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in case of dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; therefore, they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent side kidney toxicity (lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times of mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Cholelithiasis was also detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81-times the recommended maximum dose in humans (mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The effectiveness of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three quarters earlier an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole gift or as monotherapy) was compared with the medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients with Abraxane responded to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Considering only those patients who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between drug efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It must also not be applied to patients who have low neutrophilenzenes in the blood before or before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective in patients in which the first treatment was not more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that in contrast to other paclitaxel medicines, it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the marketing of Abraxane throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for the standard anthracycline-containing therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophilology &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In the case of sensory neuropathy grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted until improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2, and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adaptations in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see Section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="285">While a cardiotoxicity clearly associated with Abraxane is not proven, cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">In case of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea following the application of Abraxane, these can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constipating methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used for pregnant women or women in childbearing age, who do not exercise effective contraception, except the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is essential.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane will be advised to testify during and up to six months after the treatment no child.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm conserved, since the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (often), which can affect the ability of transport and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">Below are the most common and most important incidence of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was fast reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported to 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 contains the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>

<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in relation to a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and there was no causal connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an optimising microtubules active ingredient that promotes the cohesion of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules by blocking their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of microtubules, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and within the framework of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminrezeptor and a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour due to the albuminous protein SPARC (cream rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unlinked studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomised Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given an infusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg. / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastasestellen.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9. the results for overall response rate and time to progression-free survival and progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity towards Paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy level 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to abound at baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active ingredient exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous injection of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft tissue binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of Paclitaxel were compared with the values of a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane injection (43%) than after a solvent-based paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative ureexation of the unaltered active substance was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the drug (specialist information), labelling and packaging supplement. • With explicit imaging of the correct application of the product, refrigerated boxes for transport through the patients.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug which has already been approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called the "reference drug").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-sensing values in which complications could occur in connection with blood transfusion, if a blood donation is not possible before the intervention and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to have an own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his caregiver, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron levels of all patients must be monitored prior to treatment in order to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who receive chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoietal deficiency, or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby diminish the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) was inserted, enabling it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">In a major study with 479 patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems, Abseamed was compared with the reference drug remedy.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected for at least eight weeks Eprex / Erypo in a vein before they were either switched to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">In addition, the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of streamed out below the skin streamed with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were converted to abseamed were maintained in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12,0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stinging migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">It may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Streamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treatment of kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that in accordance with the European Union standards the evidence was provided that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces Abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission issued a approval to the company Medice Medicce Pütter GmbH & Co KG for the marketing of Abseamed throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, which receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is based on the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate, in planned major surgical interventions that require large blood volume (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">In order to reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a large elective orthopedic intervention in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>

<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7,5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and consequences may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease; therefore, the evaluation of individual clinical course and disease condition by the physician is required.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in one patient over or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobinvariability, an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value rises by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied at the lowest permitted dose, which is required for controlling anaemia and anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in whom initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical findings suggest that patients with an initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than those in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by means of an intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in increments of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anaemia symptoms and - follow-up symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of individual clinical course and disease condition by the doctor is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobinvariability, an appropriate dose management should be attempted to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied at the lowest permitted dose required for control of anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment of the hemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Reticulozyte number increased by ≥ 40.000 cells / µl versus the initial value, the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reciprocal cycle of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.E. g / kg three times a week the hemoglobin value is increased by ≥ 1 g / kg (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the Reticulozyte number of ≥ 40.000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the Retiulozyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl versus the initial value, a response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%) in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood canned patients is required should receive a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should be started as early as possible, for example, a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donation program, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the seamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg epoetin alfa which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg on 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given over the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who develop under treatment with any erythropoetin on an erythroblastoma (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a Abseamed or any other erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastomia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboemboliss).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are not able to participate in an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recently acquired heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomia (PRCA) Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody mediated PRCA after monate- to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reversal cycle value should be determined and the usual causes for failure (iron, folacid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminia toxicity, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reciprocyte value is low (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), thrombocy- and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other reason for a loss of effect is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered for the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous application of Abseamed in patients with a risk of an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 Patients with chronic kidney failure should not exceed the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed if erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin- target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit to the administration of epoetins if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control anaemia and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive heart disease, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present knowledge, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients treated with chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin alfa drugs and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapy efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of Patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - Dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk reduction in the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for greater electrical orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated appropriately before the onset of epoetin alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially for underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglob value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood level of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindose should be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">There are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in relation to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebral ischemic attacks, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, lung embolism, anthromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>

<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less common in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledron acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">Aclasta manufactures reconnaissance material for doctors who prescribe Aclasta to treat osteoporosis, which contains clues on how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="586">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women and men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently diagnosed low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • The pack supplement • Concontraindications in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required need for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When it comes to medical or nursing aid</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • for postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently diagnosed low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with low-traumatic hip fractures, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended for two or more weeks following the surgical treatment of hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment by Paget with Aclasta, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently diagnosed low-traumatic hip fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the administration of acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see Section 4.4) In patients with a creatinine clearing &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and juveniles under the age of 18, as data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia can be treated with Aclasta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia may develop, usually occurring within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to an application of bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental procedures, no data is available, whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoarthritis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan for each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the administration of acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of adverse events reported by atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51 from 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall incidence of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledron acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which, as a decrease in renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases, expressed acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change of the creatinine clearing (measured annually prior to administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as reduced renal function were comparable in a clinical trial for osteoporosis over three years comparable to the Aclasta- and placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days of the application was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory findings, temporary asymptomatic calcium levels were found in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the disease-Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study in the study on preventing clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to prevent clinical fractures after a recently diagnosed hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of zoledron acid in a large clinical trial, local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, were reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonekrosis in the jaw area was occasionally reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteoarthritis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area at one with Aclasta and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdose, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation can be achieved by means of oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconat.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) -T score for the Schenkelhal ≤ 0.2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric fluidized fractures Aclasta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients aged 75 years and older had a reduced risk of 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed an equally lasting effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density at lumbar vertebrac acid, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of bone density of lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, of the femoral neck by 5.1% and distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology With 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic ridge.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomographic (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume compared with placebo and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone grafting markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periods of study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5-mg dose Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP by 30% compared to the initial value and was held at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the placebo group treated with Aclasta, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the aclasta treatment compared to placebo treatment increased BMD at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The treatment led to an increase of BMD by 5.4% on the total air and 4.3% on the Schenkelhals over 24 months compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% for Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (Study CZOL446M2308), the once-weekly administration of Alendronat was not subject to the weekly administration of Alendronat relative to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly mild to moderate-severe disease Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase in accordance with the 2,6fold to 3,0fold age-specific upper normal value when taking into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg cinoledron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg risedronat once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months of comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain and pain was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the 6-month main study (responded to therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with Aclasta and 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was maintained with 141 of the patients treated with aclasta, compared to 71 of patients treated with risedronate, in a mean duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of cioledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long period of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphase vanishing from the large cycle with half-life times t ½ a 0.24 and t ½ to 1,87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early phases of distribution (α and β, with the above 2 ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid resorption in bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the given dose is found in urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total-body clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of 5 to 15 minutes of infusion was reduced by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration vs. time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearing of the substances that are metabolized by cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Zoledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolic inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal clearing of the Coledron acid correlated with the creatinine clearing, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine clearing, and in the 64 examined patients mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a light (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function disorder down to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the coledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe renal function disorder (Kreatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) is limited, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-perforated intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies of dogs, single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on the AUC should be 6 times the recommended humane-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous use, the renal tolerability of zoledron acid in rats was administered in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose equivalent to the 7fold the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">Long-term studies with repeated application in cumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure occurred in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as at the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphor of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, an infection that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive action of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, a teratogenicity of doses from 0.2 mg / kg was observed as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and skeletal abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium level.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the medicine is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application; normally, 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Safety Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) where metformin (a diabetic medication) is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially obese patients), which cannot be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin in the highest tolerated dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonic resin or insulin, the current dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better used and the blood sugar level decreases, allowing type 2 diabetes to be adjusted better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl resin, in addition, they received up to 3.5 years either actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of supplementing Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl resin showed a 0.94% reduction in HbA1c values, while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin had a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who additionally took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesiology (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazon or any of the other ingredients, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for the marketing of Actos across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the mark" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and where metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for pioglitazon in patients under the age of 18, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazon in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated output liver enzyme levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased up to 3-times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark harn, the liver enzyme values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of patients with pioglitazon should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters have been established.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazon, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can stir up fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">A slight reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred as a result of hemodilution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazon in patients with metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and haemoglobin by 1-2% and haemoglobin by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazon as oral two-fold or triple-combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, patients with Thiazolidindionen, including pioglitazon, have reported a decrease in visual acuity during the treatment with Thiazolidindionen, including pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazon and the appearance of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report on disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of undesirable events regarding bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is to be removed (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies to investigate the interactions have shown that pioglitazon exerts no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of pioglitazon by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC from Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazon diminishes the hyperinsulinemia associated with pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for reddening growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not appreciated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the lens and index of refraction, as observed in other hypoglycemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazon ALT-Anstiege went beyond three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as under placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure under pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than in placebo, if pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported about congestive heart failure under pioglitazon, but more often when pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with more than 8,100 patients in patients treated with pioglitazon and more than 7,400 patients in the treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study running over a period of 3.5 years, fractures with 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazon were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">At intake of the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not occur.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxicome proliferation) activated by the activated Receptor γ (PPAR-γ)), leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was continued for two years to study the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) was maintained by pioglitazon in 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar had been insufficient with insulin despite three months of optimization were randomized to pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to patients who continued to receive only insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over one year pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotient compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as insignificant but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, pioglitazon reduced overall plasmatglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazid, and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was found under Pioglitazon, while decreased values were observed under metformin and Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the Nüchtern triglyceride levels but also improved the postprandial heightened triglyceride levels, both of which effect on triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized in groups who received either pioglitazon or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazon is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazon in plasma can usually be reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to efficacy is equivalent to three times the effectiveness of pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it could be proven that pioglitazon exerts no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (Cytochrom P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive Pioglitazon in humans, the marker was found mainly in the resin (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma elmination period of unaltered pioglitazon is 5-6 hours in humans, and all active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearance of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies mice, rats, dogs and monkeys occurred following repeated administration of plasma volume increase with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazon diminishes the hyperinsulinemia resulting in the gestation and increases the availability of the metabolic substrates for reddening growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazolidindions resulted in increased frequency of colon tumours.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazon were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study more than two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with each pioglitazon or Gliclazid were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotient compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the Nüchtern triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial heightened triglyceride level, which has an effect on Tryglyceride absorption and hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the target for its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularization and reascularisation of leg arteries, the results suggest that the intake of pioglitazon does not involve cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="1186">As with other diuretic medicines, it can lead to acute toxicity during the treatment, because of the lowering of the serum resin column, uric acid deposits can first be mobilised in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1187">For example, in malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch- Nyhan-Syndrome) the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases is so much rising that there is a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During phase 3 clinical trials, slight differences in liver function were observed in patients treated with febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of febuxostattreatment and in the further course depending on clinical findings (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline ZB did not perform any inefficiency studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibit may lead to a rise in theophyline (an inhibition of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous administration of febuxostat and naproxen was associated with an increase in febuxostature exposure (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochloroazide / Warfarin Febuxostat may be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without requiring a dose adjustment for febuxostat or the other active substance applied at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1195">Antacids It could be shown that simultaneous consumption of antacids containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide, delayed the absorption of febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease in CMAx by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregnancies do not include side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful in controlling a vehicle, operating machinery, or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported was observed in the overall febuxostats in the pivotal study of phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1,4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were arteriosclerotic disease and / or myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse events that could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg febuxostat and which were reported more than once in all Febuxostat treatment groups, are listed below.</seg>

<seg id="1216">The lowering of the serum resin level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and permanently maintained throughout the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received Allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum creatine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney function restriction The APEX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction (D).</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy endpoint was reached at 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage decline of serum acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their kidney function (58% in group with normal kidney function and 55% in group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>

<seg id="1222">The data collected in the open extension study in Phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of serum resin acid levels at &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in incidence of rheumatism (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against rheumatism).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gail, which results in 54% of patients a complete disappearance of the top notches until month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µg / ml) were observed in patients who received a long-term treatment with febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat were increased by administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in the AUC is observed for febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking single or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the CMAx is about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentration, provided that this was examined (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>

<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was found in the urine as unmodified febuxostat (30%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">Besides the excretion of urine, approximately 45% of the dose was found in the chair as unmodified febuxostat (12%), Acylglukuronid of the active substance (1%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) and other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups of renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat increased by approximately the 1.8-fold of 7.5 μ µg / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ µg µg / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver Dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Childdgh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B) Liver function restriction changed the CMAx and AUC from Febuxostat and its metabolites did not significantly increase compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>

<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after a treatment duration of one year (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter studies on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant were carried out and investigated, as Advagraf is absorbed by the body in comparison to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this drug or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or regime should be carried out only under the closely meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Section4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adaptations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus can be maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of adventif should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level measurements (see below) Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus Talmirrors should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after switching.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus Talmirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate posttransplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because Tacrolimus is a substance with a low clearance, an adjustment of the Advagraf can take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adaptations can be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - Liver Transplantation Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf Must a graft recipient of twice daily dose of Prograf capsules converted to a once daily intake of adventif, this conversion has to take place in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant after switching from other immunosuppressants to adventif once a day, the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplants must commence for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients who are converted to adventif, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with adventif in lung, pancreatic and colorectal graft patients, was used in a oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in case of an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in case of intestinal transplant recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood age levels in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum creatine level, a calculation of the creatininclearance and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switching from Ciclosporin to Advagraf In case of switching from a ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy is caution (see Section4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the level of blood in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the help of full-blood Tacrolimus Talking controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus Talking levels during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to adventif, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or while applying substances which could alter the Tacrolimus full blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low Clearance, adjustments can take several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the levels of the blood in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the valley levels of tacrolimus in whole blood are usually carried out in the first time after liver transplantations in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and nift and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur in a sequence of Tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or regime should be performed only under the closely meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have proven to be refractory compared to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retarding formulation Advagraf are available.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In order to prevent graft rejection in adult heart transplants and transplant recipients in childhood, no clinical data for the retarding formulation Advagraf are available.</seg>
<seg id="1443">The use of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies during treatment with Advagraf (see Section 4.5) is due to possible interactions that may lead to reducing the Tacrolimus's clinical effect.</seg>
<seg id="1444">A particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required in patients with diarrhoea since the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf, a chamber or septum hypertrophie was observed under Prograf, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus have symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and vision disorders, a radiological examination should be (e.g.).</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advagraf hard capsules, retardians, lactose are present in patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption special caution is required.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and thus increase or lower blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while simultaneously administering substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as it is used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; hence, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As Tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormone levels, decisions about contraceptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazon and can prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of studies on transplant patients do not indicate that in comparison to other immunosuppressiva, an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy exists.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, it is recommended to monitor the newborn to possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1467">Benign or malignant neoplasmosis including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in conjunction with tacrolimus treatment were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects At the molecular level, the effects of Tacrolimus may be conveyed by its binding to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for enriching the connection in the nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcium-dependent blocking of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a specific series of lymphoomic genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, and the formation of lymphoma (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) and the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acuations amounted to 32.6% within the first 24 weeks in the Advagraf group (N = 237) and 29.3% in the Prograf group (N = 234).</seg>
<seg id="1473">Patient survival rates after 12 months were 89.2% for lawyers and 90.8% for Prograf; in the Advagraf arm 25 (14 women, 11 men) and the Prograf arm 24 (5 women, 19 men) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Kidney transplantation The efficacy and safety of adventif and prograf was compared in combination with mycophenolatmofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, in 667 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>

<seg id="1476">The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advagraf was compared in combination with Basiliximab-antibody reduction, MMF and corticosteroids, in 638 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The incidence of therapy failure after 12 months (defined as death, loss of graft rejection, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection or missing follow-up data) was 14.0% in the Prograf group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin Group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The difference in treatment was -3.0% (Advagraph Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advagraf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf-Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1479">In the Advagraf arm there were 3 (men), in Prograf-Arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in the Ciclosporin arm 6 (3 females, 3 men) deaths.</seg>
<seg id="1480">Published results of primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus in the form of two daily applied Prograf capsules after other primary organ transplants Prograf has developed into a recognized primary immunosuppressant following pancreatic, lung and intestinal transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1481">175 patients with 475 patients undergoing pancreatic transplantation and in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant as primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies was consistent with observations in the large studies in which Prograf was used for liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients for primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multi-centre study with oral Prograf was reported to over 110 patients who received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In patients treated with Tacrolimus, the incidence of a bronchiolitis obliterans occurred in 21,7% compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be changed to Tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients being switched from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which no acute graft rejection occurred was increased after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the patients of the Tacrolimus Group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome in patients treated with tacrolimus was significantly lower.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pankreastransplantation A multicenter study with oral prograf was conducted in 205 patients who received a pancreatic and kidney transplant, which received Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Colorectal transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after intestinal transplantations showed a current survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow augmentation, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist daclizumab, lower initial doses of tacrolimus, leading to talreflect between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently acquired transplant radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low haematocrit value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This can be concluded that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion is mainly done via bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in case of stable patients (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus Talking levels during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have proven to be refractory compared to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retarding formulation Advagraf are available.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood coagulation disorder due to lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether lawyers are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method known as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell into which a gene (DNA) was inserted into which it enables the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently, so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of the drug to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures has been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advents in the prevention of hemorrhages in 86% of 510 new bleeding periods with "excellent" or "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advents may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the marketing of lawyers across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the Factor VIII deficiency, after the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of the following hemorrhagic events, the VIII-activity factor should not sink below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) to repeat until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma gas is recommended to control the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to Factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.E. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-plasma activities are not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The speed should be adjusted after finding the patient, and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of Factor VIII, IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma with modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to the Factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">After switching from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (low-trim) inhibitors was observed in pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestic known inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of Factor VIII (5 patients) who performed all previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of forming inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected decrease of the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spider occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VIII- Mirror in the plasma and the Clearance rate showed again sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient with ADVATE showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, in none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) a FVIII inhibitor (≥ 50 days) was detected.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients an ongoing clinical trial comprised 5 of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE versus Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titres against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, pruritus, skin rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the scope of the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reported about hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactic reactions (frequency not known).</seg>
<seg id="1567">The activated Factor VIII acts as a coofactor for the activated Factor IX and accelerates the formation of the X-factor X activated factor X.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All pharmacokinetics studies with ADVATE were performed on previously treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (basic value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2%).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of ADVATE's safety profile that requires a filing of PSURs every 6 months, that the authorisation holder should apply for a further extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited informed the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) officially stating that the company receives its application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">However, the breast, brain, bones or soft tissues (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has been modified so that it cannot produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body usually helps restore damaged DNA and kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient, in which Li-Fraumeni-cancer appeared in the area of the substructure, in bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the company's answers to the questions asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initial documents submitted, the CHMP will create a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumours benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be established in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or "Commodity-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever caused by an allergy to pollen caused inflammation of the nose passages) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents 12 years old, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminate as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy was the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the start of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hypocrisy symptoms except constipation of the nose, patients who received aerinaze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients who received pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, patients under aerinaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% to 26.7% in patients who took desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic substances or lauatadin (another drug used to treat allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients who suffer from a narrow-angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), heart or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroiosis (hyperthyrophy) or a haemorrhagic stroke (stroke) or a risk of a haemmorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe to authorize the transfer of aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but can be swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on harmlessness and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, since the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease with time during long-term use.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, dimethurid, cabergoline, ergotamine, dexydroergotamine or other deongestiva, which are perorally or nasal as abssive Rhinoplasty (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data does not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not checked for patients with kidney or liver function and the data does not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment with hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or strengthening of headache) must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Treating patients with heart rhythm disorders • Patients with hypertonia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder halobstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is to be deprecated at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests, as antihistamines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In clinical trials with Desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test there were no significant differences between the patients treated with the desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, no matter whether or not desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin is not inhibiting in vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies however did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and because of the vasoconstrictor characteristics of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">The patients should, however, be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness which may lead to impairment of the mutilation or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS-stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible sequential processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, aggravating miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordiale pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disorders and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (mouth dry, pupil rigidity and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesive molecule P selectivity on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In an individual dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily there was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in recommended dosage can cause further likeable effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 took part in seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equivalent of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects, four subjects of desloratadin were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was for exposure to the gift of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin could not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicology studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application, the pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, runny or itchy noses and drowning or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you are experiencing or diagnosing the following symptoms or diseases using aerinaze: • high blood pressure • Alchasing, palpitations • arrhythmias disorders • nausea and headache or strengthening existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have other medicines or have recently taken medication, even if they are non-prescription drugs.</seg>

<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you have forgotten the intake of aerinaze, if you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects listed are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not indicated in this manual information.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (breathing difficulty, whistling breathing, itching, hives rash and swelling) or rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspicuous liver values was also very rare reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate for intake (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml syrup for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies involving about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by determining the changes in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrant, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body utilizes syrup, the solution to intake and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius led to an average decrease in the symptom score (symptom score) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two trials at Urtikaria, the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% compared with placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Erius must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, lauatadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the marketing of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be performed according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms have been cancelled and resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended for patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were noted in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinically pharmacological study, the performance reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that it may occur in very rare cases which may lead to impairment of the transport capability or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported in placebo reported tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical trial of 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headache, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multidose study involving up to 45 mg of desloratadine (nine-time clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesive molecule P-seltin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study in which Desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval appeared.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes, as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis are defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated on the basis of the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated for further forms of Urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of aetiology, is similar in different forms and chronic patients can be rectified in a simple prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histaminfection is a causative factor in all of the causal diseases, it is expected that in other forms of the Urticaria, desloratadin will also lead to an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of quadrant at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the itching rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and being awake significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, where patient demographics were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients reached a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation following a daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and there are no data available to support an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect the flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that is supposed to protect against a strain of the influenza virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus occurs, which can easily spread from man to man, because humans have not yet built immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to form antibodies in a contact with a flu virus of this common ancestor.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane shell of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as a foreign body) was removed, cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "a survey of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asgenerase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked the antiviral drugs used by the patient before, and the likelihood is that the virus will respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with 100 mg kritonavir twice a day and with other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenerase depends on body weight.</seg>

<seg id="1910">However, the damage to the immune system and the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS cannot delay.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The medicine Agenerase, which was prescribed with low dose, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or alteration of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the amount of virus, but only very few of the children treated with protease inhibitors were very few.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the medication Agenerase reinforced the viral load after 16-week treatment just as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase came together with Ritonavir to increase the viral load after four weeks compared to patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea, nausea, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Asgenerase may not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines which are broken down as well as asgenerase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines against HIV, patients who take Agenerase are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or immune activation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the rejuvenating immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of asgenerase used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years versus the risks associated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Asgenerase is usually taken together with the Pharmacokinetic Amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee found that the benefit of asgenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not take protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because only limited information was presented at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the marketing of asgenerase across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Asgenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, amgenerase caps should be given to the pharmacokinetic booster of amprenavir together with low doses of kritonavir (see Section4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% less than amprenavir as capsule; therefore, asgenerase caps and solution for taking one milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg kritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing additive of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Asgenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data on harmlessness and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be taken with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asgenerase should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the ingestion of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, amgenerase caps should be used together with low doses of kritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of an antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing limited liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal gland function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Norised Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">For patients who use this medication at the same time, asgenerase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opium, especially if also low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Asgenerase should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases requiring medication to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hammophilous patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is accepted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis in particular were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic latitude may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be given together with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly metabolized via CYP2D6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir, which may lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In an attempt to balance the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often adverse effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already receives St. John's wort, the amprenavirus levels and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nelfinavir is given together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">50% increases, compared to CMAx by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg Amprenavir were used twice a day and in Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% humbled when Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">Amprenavir concentrations in plasma, which have been achieved twice a day in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily), are about 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study for use of asgenerase in combination with didanosin, however, due to the analogue component of didanosin, it is recommended that the revenues of didanosine and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">This is why in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz combined with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would lower.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapine may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised, as Delavirdin may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma gas.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Caution is required when these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, to administer Rifabutin along with Agenerase, at least half of the recommended dose is advised to reduce the dose of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose, although there is no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asgenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of two daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of CMAx from ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-grade) to 2.69x compared to the value that was observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that can be listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions if they are used together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines, if used in combination with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that Antazida should not be taken at the same time as asgenerase as it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsiants known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to degradation of the plasma gas of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, diltiazem, Felodipin, Isradipin, Nicardipin, Nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil may be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous ingesting with asgenerase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and amplify the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors associated with hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous administration of asgenerase with kritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are expected to increase the plasma levels with simultaneous administration of asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of this medicinal product with Amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations is recommended until stabilization of the mirror, since the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be used together with orally taken Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while the simultaneous use of asgenerase with parenteral midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opium, especially if also low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given at the moment how the amprenavirus dose is to be adjusted if amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With concurrent administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regulated Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of kritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with concurrent administration of asgenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir related substances have been detected in the milk lactation rats, but it is not known whether amprenavir is transferred to breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the emplacement in the uterus to the end of the lactation period Amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during the breastfeeding period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of seed including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of asgenerase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with the Agenerase Treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely led to the treatment abruption.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are associated with the intake of asgenerase or other drugs used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which protease inhibitors did not receive pre-treated patients 1200 mg asgenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and faal subcutaneous fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsozervikal fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with Lamivudine / Zidovudine over a mean period of 36 weeks, only one case (bullfights) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 trial, in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rash was usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoarthritis cases have been reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or resident opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg asgenerase twice daily along with low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable with those observed in patients who received asgenerase along with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient must observe signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary support measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag and gag polymers with the result of a formation of unmature, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated in both acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmer concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in the case of chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir versus HIV-1 in vitro and inhibiting HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other ritonavir geboosterte treatment schemes with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral previously untreated patients who received 700mg Fosamprenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolate of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59, with protease inhibitors not previously treated patients, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / L, I54L / M / T / V, I84V, V77I, I62A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 trial and their extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107), patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Prototype interpretation systems based on genotypic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with increased phenotypic resistance to Ritonavir and a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing Klinisch validated phenotypic interpretations can be applied in conjunction with the genotypic data for estimating the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples associated with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir creates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 fossiamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral previously untreated patients (one of which showed a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir (one of 25 isolates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three out of 25 isolates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three out of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir keeps its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Premature termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits which can adversely affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of asgenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which with PI pre-treated adults following virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and nucleodanaloga (NRTI) or standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-submission threshold of 0.4 logical copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of unbiased asgenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 was pretreated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agenerase was used for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on these data, the expected benefits of" "" "unbundled" "" "amgenerase should be considered during therapy optimisation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">50% increases, compared to CMAx by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">The minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake was influenced by the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir representing the active part remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the area of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 / or inhibit a CYP3A4 substrate must be administered with caution when given at the same time with asgenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase Capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable than the capsules; therefore, asgenerase solution and Agenerase Capsules are not replaceable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, hence the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes result in amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those on healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats occurred in male animals benign hepatocellular adenomas in doses that correspond to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8-fold (rat) of exposure to humans after two daily dose of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans, both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, which included bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test of rats and chromosome aberrations on human peripheral lymphocytes, Amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">In clinical studies, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of Agenerase nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals, which were treated at an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure that was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, indicating a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing additive of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be done with care in patients with low or mild liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Norised Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz combined with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would lower.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Caution is required when these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, to administer Rifabutin along with Agenerase, at least half of the recommended dose is recommended to reduce the dose of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, diltiazem, Felodipin, Isradipin, Nicardipin, Nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil may be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical trial in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With concurrent administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regulated Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of ortho-novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1,0 mg of Norethindron) resulted in a reduction in the AUC and Cmin of amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2086">Conversely, Amprenavir keeps its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, the expected benefits of "unbiased" asterase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI.</seg>

<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratosis on the forearms and hands does not support effectiveness in this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions normally take place in the course of therapy in intensity or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod Cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort to the patient or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 lesions showed a lower complete cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, Imiquimod Cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">From animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / foetus development, the birth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although no quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) can be obtained neither after one-off or repeated topical application, no recommendation for use during breastfeeding can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most frequently shared and considered likely or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine cream in connection with side effects in studies with three-week treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the cowards (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most frequently reported and considered probable or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine cream associated with side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Basaliom patients treated with Imiquimod Cream from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial reported side effects below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, as likely or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod cream in connection with the side effect were in these studies a reaction to the application location (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">Side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with Imiquimodine-Cream treated patients with acute keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with three times weekly treatment with Imiquimodine Crème is common to local skin reactions including Erythem (61%), erosion (30%), exkoriation / defling (23%) and edema (14%) and edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the test plan, evaluation of clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with imiquimodine crème extremely frequently resulted in serious erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe scoring and salutation (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of acute keratosis, alopecia was determined with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Accidental unique oral absorption of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hypotonia normalized after oraler or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination, systemic levels of alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies showed that efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the cowardis during Imiquimodine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of patients treated with Imiquimod, the patients healed completely; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Total healing was achieved in 23% of 157 with imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The effectiveness of Imiquimod with five-time application per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumours were histologically confirmed individual primary superfical basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients had been clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free time period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non hyperkeratotic, non hypertrophic lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the uneasy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications external inclination, acute keratosis and Superceral cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of imiquimod could not be shown in these studies at the dosages studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic inclusion of the 5% Imiquimodine cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratome was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and betrugen 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated obvious half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study, indicating an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Systemic exposure data showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6-12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinical keratosis or superfical basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased Milz weight; a study carried out for four months for dermal application yielded no similar effects on the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice with dermal administration on three days a week did not induce tumors at the application area.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mutagen, there is a risk for the human being to be regarded as very low due to the systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the true-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency), in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms which are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the movements complicate, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing equipment, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly examined for the safety of the drug but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme sensed the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60% and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthroropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review and review all the new information that may be disclosed each year.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyme in response to the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the marketing of Alduraziyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-ion idase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been identified, and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyma in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the Infusion Day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should be performed only in an appropriate clinical setting where revitational equipment for medical emergencies is immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that nearly all IgG antibodies form antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when applying aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment, there is little experience regarding the resumption of treatment after a longer interruption.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamine and / or antipyreticular) to minimise the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or moderate infusion reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a severe infusion-related reaction the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamine and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied concurrently with chloroquin or Procain, because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data in newborns exposed to laronidase over mother's milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly treated as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breaths and facial edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug interactions associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5, with predominantly severe form of course and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients came to a seroconversion within 3 months after the start of the treatment, whereby the patients at the age of five were mostly in a seroconversion (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or up to early excretion from the study), 13 / 45 patients were not exposed to immunohistochemistry (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients, in which there was never a seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with missing or low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine, while a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was observed in patients with high antibody titers.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro which seemed to not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely to have manose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient demonstrated the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expirator volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme each week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme compared the placebo group to improve lung function and ability to function in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as highlighted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the anticipated percentage of FEV is clinically insignificant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased proportionally to the size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease of the GAG-Spiegel in the urine (µg / mg creatinine) was found, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint, the clinically significant changes spanned across five efficacy variables (anticipated percentage normal FEV, range in the 6-minute walk, range of movement of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A 1-year-old open phase 2 study was conducted in which Aldurazyme studied safety and pharmacokinetics in 20 patients, who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe form and 4 with mid-run form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- Mirror in Harn in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was noted after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of course (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle course shape had a normal mental development rate, whereas in the older patients with severe form of course there were only limited or no advances in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study, studies on pharmacocodynamic effects of various aldurazyma dosing schemes were carried out on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (cancer drugs) and "maligne" (malignant - the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body. • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer, which does not attack the squamous epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used for patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should receive a corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and injections of vitamin B12.</seg>

<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Converting Pemetrexed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin showed an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, Alimta's average survival was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells in the administration of Alimta showed longer survival compared with the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the marketing of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary do- sis is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of second-line treatment of patients with lo- cal advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface area (KOF) is administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after graduation of Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is given intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed gift as well as the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) during the week before the first Pemetrexed dose as well as after each third session.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetrexed, a full blood sample should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose testing must take place taking account of the Nadirs of the Blood Pattern or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grad 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients do not develop hematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity 3 or 4 occurs or so- fort the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or more in comparison to patients at the age of 65 an increased side effect risk exists.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials patients with a creatinine clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min had no dose adaptations that go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinine clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function limit of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Biliruby limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone maruppression and Pemetrexed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrality number returns a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the platelet-cyte number has reached a value of more than 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrality, platelet count and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous cycles of treatment (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 haematological and non-matological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was affected when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed must be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophy- lactic action to reduce the toxicity of treated toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate kidney failure (creatinine clearing 45 to 79 ml / min) must prevent simultaneous consumption of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, intended for treatment with Pemetrexed, must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion should be considered before the Pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Several cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving pemetrexed when this substance was commonly administered in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage of reproductive capacity is made by Pemetrexed, men should be advised against the treatment of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the lock conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearing ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid (≥ 1.3 g per day) may result in reduced pemetremixed excretion with the result of an increased incidence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is therefore advised when high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid are used in patients with normal kidney function (creatinine clearing ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed are avoided (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous use with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- uretic antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be used during pregnancy, except if it is essential and after careful weighing of the crop for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the onset of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm conserved.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetrexed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to placebo in 391 obese patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both trials of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg after one year had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no significant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side-effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily patches on anus, Flatus (winch) with stub labeling, stool, oily / oily chair, oily secretion (fences), flatulence (winch) and soft stools.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in graft patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypocaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimally resorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin • Cholestase • Pregnancy (see Section 4.6) • lactation period (see Section 4.6) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli, because the dosage of the antidiabetic should be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who are allergic to high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines must be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy prevention measures to prevent the failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with concurrent use of orlistat and ciclosporin, a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (international normal-ised ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta carotene in the normal range remained.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, the patient should be advised to take a complementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime in order to ensure a sufficient vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After a single dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological action of the medicine, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials involving orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of adverse events reported after the market launch of orlistat is unknown, since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese individuals over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosing, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a quick recovery of any systemic effects that can be traced back to the locating properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect continues in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin-rest of the gastrischen and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have shown that 60 mg orlistat is taken three times a day, blocking absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies of adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypocaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as part of those study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value: 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat was 60 mg (starting value of 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, not metabolized orlistat in plasma could be detected only sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study involving obese patients, which was given the minimally systemic resorbed dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-Formyl-leucine group), could be identified which represented nearly 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data cannot be recognised any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is applied in chemotherapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies that are moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is insufficient information about the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three major studies involving 1,842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are severe or moderate nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with alxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapies, the moderate nausea and vomiting, showed 81% of patients treated with alxi, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (153 of 189), versus 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a Corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with an amnesty obstipation or sign of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advised if Palonosetron is present with medicines that extend the QT interval or in cases where the Qt interval is prolonged or which tend towards such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not to be used in the days following chemotherapy to prevent or prevent nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapeutics studied against tumors (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cycloabine, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady State- concentration oralen metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population analysis, CYP2D6 Inhibitors (dexamodarone and Rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (ammiodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, haloperidol, paroxetine, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of palonosetron for human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women, unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly associated with almaxi (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the performance (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were stated in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage similar frequencies of adverse events occurred as in other dosage groups; there were no dose-effects relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, but due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for an alopxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 patients who received a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 of Dolasetron (half-life 7.3 hours) were given intravenously on Day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron, which were given intravenously on Day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies of moderate emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for the indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron were comparable.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The goal of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was to assess the ECG effects of a predetermined Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">After intravenous administration, an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average half-life of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are dose-proportional in the whole dose range of 0.3- 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration measured at 42 ± 34% was measured between Day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous injection of 0.25 mg palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with the value measured after a single intravenous dose of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the single dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser degree, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 mg / kg [14C] -palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous stub injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were only observed after expositions seen as sufficient over the maximum humantherapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies, evidence suggests that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is low compared to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report, recommending the use of Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called" "" "Roferon-A" "", "which is already approved in the EU (also called the" "" "reference drug" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damages damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to stimulate the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that substantiate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, effectiveness, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study it was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after setting the treatment to the medication (i.e. no signs of the virus reported in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients, which responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was returning to more patients than with the reference drug; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug), is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crusts formation) and small infected infirmities (fissures or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alarma may not have an effect against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients at the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the area to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo talked to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or by infections provoked or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the placing place.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of altargo should outweigh the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmities, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the marketing of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined once again and consider alternative therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation by applying retapamulin ointment, the treatment is canceled, the ointment is carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as a pathogen (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retinobulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on skewed skin or infected superficial wounds (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole, the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased from 1% Retapamulin ointment on skated skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adaptations are not required if topical retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and foetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Reapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy should be continued / terminated with Altargo, the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman should be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo used was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the place of performance that concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosome interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomales protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the PeptidyltransferaseCentre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, pleuromutiline inhibits the peptidyltransfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance to the use of retapamulin at least some infection forms appear questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin to S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to respond to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% reapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion on intact and striped skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% reapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 of the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 deported skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the reapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolite of retinobulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test respectively in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats microkernel test for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 skated skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats, at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-times of estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of permission to apply for the marketing is obliged to conduct detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Blood products for human use," the updated RMP will be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area show you should end the use of altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with altargo if it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment comes from looking on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gazeverband unless your doctor has advised you to not cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic closure which contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminum bag containing 0.5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect the hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "Ambirix will be applied within the framework of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis C or -B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the natural defence of the body), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child received the vaccine, the immune system recognises viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same constituents as the vaccine Twinrix Adults, which has been approved since 1996 and has been licensed since 1997 with Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same illnesses, but Twinrix Adults and Twinrix children are administered within the framework of an existing vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults, also used as proof for applying Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix conducted between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar in a six-month period and a 12 month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals a licence for placing Ambirix in the whole.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for Grundimmunization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, where the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the appropriate monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies were found in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully ensured that immunocompetent individuals who have responded to hepatitis B vaccination need a refresher vaccination as they may also be protected by immunological memory in non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardised vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hemodialysis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system, there may be no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels, so that in these cases the addition of further vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal impact success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix may be subcutaneous injected, as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maturality, gastroenteritis, headache and fever is comparable to the frequency observed with the earlier thiomerase and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the tolerance of Ambirix was compared to that of the 3-dose combination.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a calculation basis for the Ambirix vaccination dose, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">After the administration of Ambirix, pain was observed at 50.7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% in subjects following the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the patients who had given Ambirix had given birth over pain, compared to 63.8% among the subjects, who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matency was comparable to a proband (i.e., over the whole vaccine cycle at 39.6% of subjects receiving Ambirix compared to 36.2% in subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and maturation was low and comparable to that observed after the combination of the combined vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines reported about serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 up to 15 years, serum conversion rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinant vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was expectable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the gift of the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11-year-olds one month after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received either a 2-dose inoculation scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose inoculation scheme with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were aged between 12 and 15 years, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 month vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunreaction observed in this study was comparable to that which was detected after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalinininactivated Hepatic A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- to including 15-year-olds could be demonstrated that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the refresher of a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates similar to earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resuspense on possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may require hospitalisation.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against infection with Hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccines, an inoculation may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections affecting the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any component of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may be caused by itching skin rash, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you / your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a high level of protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the planned second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">With a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vaccination protection before end of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected to persons suffering from severe bleeding disorders, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body's defences / or if you / your child is undergoing a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the response is to vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child will take more medicines / take it (including those that you have been vaccinated without prescription) or if you / your child has recently been vaccinated / has received / has received / or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated at separate places and as different extremities.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix will not be given pregnant or breastfeeding women, unless it is urgently needed to vaccinate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have been known since obtaining the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was taken into circulation only in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonites - split into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed with food or administered via a gastrostomieslauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach's leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach's leading hose) is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammonia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a pseudo-drug, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia can also result in loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disorders or taste, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "ammonia was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval, limited information about this drug was available." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days age).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests after the first months of life), an indication of the use occurs when there is a hyperammonia encephalopathy in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and the development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbambphosphate synthetase or Ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an argininosuccinatynthetase deficiency must obtain arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swallowing because there is a risk of the formation of esophagus ulcera when the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat are carried out over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results with regard to pregnant women is not known; therefore, the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With a subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), the neuronal multiplication was slowed and the loss of neurons increased.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted to the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one undesired event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate dosis, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate associated with intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose limiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urinary cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylacetylglutamine can be produced for each gram of sodium phenylbutyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prediction of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogenous analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, using alternative ways of excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns at postpartal (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated prior to the initial appearance of a hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients there was time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the Ornithintranscarbamylase deficiency), who recovered from a hyperammonia encephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylbutyrate is known to be oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymatically with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate for sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis following individual orders as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cycle disorders or haemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable at night after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted in 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus test results, sodium phenylbutyrate had no complained effects with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is either taken orally (babies and children who cannot swallow tablets yet, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrostomieslauch or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbambphosphate synthetase or Ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rats were exposed before the birth phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), lesions were found in the pyramide cells of the cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate dosis, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, sodium phenylbutyrate of 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine can be produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form, plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after the ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">The small measuring scoop is 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon is 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to take the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrat can affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not take AMMONAPS, as the medicine may pass into breast milk and damage your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, flavorings, lack of hearing, disorientation, memory problems and worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, immediately contact your doctor or your hospital's emergency room to initiate appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you miss the intake of AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes in the blood pattern (red blood cells, white blood cells, thrombocytes), reduced appetite, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, nausea, constipation, unpleasant cutaneous odor, rash, kidney function, weight gain and abnormal laboratory values.</seg>

<seg id="2873">You can no longer use AMMONAPS after the expiration date stated on the box and the container after "User Language to" stated expiration date.</seg>
<seg id="2874">AMMONAPS looks and content of the pack AMMONAPS tablets are of whitish color and oval form, and they are provided with the embossing "UCY 500."</seg>
<seg id="2875">30 If laboratory tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2876">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS distributed on the same single doses orally or via a stomach fistel (hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal tube (hose that is led through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take a heaped spoonful of granulate from the container. • Cut a straight edge, e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the knife to remove excess granulate. • The amount remaining in the measuring scoop is equivalent to a measuring spoon. • Take the recommended number of measuring spoons granulate out of the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with varying strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an abnormal measurement value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angiox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI patients a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure) was used, and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox was - with or without a gift of GPI - in preventing new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, angiox was as effective as heparin, except for severe bleeding, in which it was much more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other miludine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had hemorrhage, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that angiox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable substitute for heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a approval to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd for the marketing of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (instabile angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in another episode, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1,75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">A bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately before the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous caption of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolt of angiox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is reduced to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before use and the bolt dose is quickly given intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the bivalirudin Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in patients with dialysis, angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intravenous administration of unfractional heparin or 8 hours after termination of subcutaneous administration of low-molecular siparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against miludine • active hemostasis and / or irreversible coagulation disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertonia and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, particularly when bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if most of the hemorrhages occur in arterial points in the case of PCI patients, patients who undergo a percutaneous corona intervention (PCI) may occur during treatment in principle, bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are using warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regulated Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after settling treatment with Bivalirudin again reaches the level before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytika or thrombocyte aggregationshemmer), it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological haemostasis parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experiments are insufficient with regard to the effects of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, disconnectedness or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractional heparin or ennoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in comparison groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding such as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivaliddin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraarterial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hematoma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the point of point, reduction of haemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bleeding center, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed hemorrcalisations, which occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" point positions, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial with bivalirudin in 6000 patients who underwent a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalirudin group and the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above were reported in practice after comprehensive application and are grouped according to system classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with bivalirudine is immediately broken off and the patient is closely meshed in terms of signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombic inhibitor, which binds to both the catalytic center and the anthrombin of the thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or in the clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible because Thrombin regenerates the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudin with serum from patients who had come to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparinindusty thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) did not induce a platelet aggregate reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalirudin demonstrates a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect that is evidenced by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was carried out below, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to receive a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the onset of angiography (at the time of randomization) or in the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were evenly distributed over the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1-year endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for patients who received aspirin and clopidogrel according to the protocol (before angiography or before the PCI) are shown in tables 7 and 8.</seg>
<seg id="2933">ACUITY study; 30-days and 1-year risk difference for the combined ischemic end point and its components for patients who received aspirin and clopidogrel according to protocol *</seg>
<seg id="2934">Patients who received aspirin and clopidogrel according to the protocol were given arm A Arm B Arm C UFH / Enox Bival B- A C- A Bival + GPIIb / IIIa + GPIIb / IIIa risk diff.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The frequency of bleeding in both ACUITY- and timi levels up to day 30 for the total population (ITT) and for patients who received aspirin and clopidogrel according to protocol is shown in Table 9.</seg>
<seg id="2936">Patients who received aspirin and Clopidogrel overall population (ITT) according to the protocol UFH / Enox Bival Bival + + alone + + GPIIb / IIIa solely GPIIb / IIIa GPIIb / IIIa (N = 2924)% (N = 4603) (N = 2842)%%%%</seg>
<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperito-neal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bleeding center, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in Table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a percutaneous corona intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Bivalirudin as peptide is expected to pass through a catabolism in its amino acid constituents with subsequent reutilization of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through Thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination occurs in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks in exposure to 10 times of the clinical steady state plasma concentration) was limited to overshooting pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects as a result of a longer-term physiological stress in response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure comparable to those in clinical use, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the manufacturing of ready-to-use solution 17 does not take place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose-1-glass bottles of 10 ml sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap of pressed aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injection purposes is given into a leakage bottle angiox and easily swiveled until everything has completely dissolved and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml extracted from the water bottle and diluted with 5% glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml of bivalirudine.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) injected into the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or administered as permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or does not process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults in type 2 diabetes, where the body is not working effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was noted compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin lispro after six months.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin levels.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for placing Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the deltoid muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the abdominal area.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active force, the brand (s), the type of insulin (normal, NPH, zinc retarded etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can change the insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or termination of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to a different type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of the occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when the treatment schemas change.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathy olytics such as beta blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpin, the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin enters into human breast milk but generally insulin does not enter the breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">The following are listed in clinical trials, sorted by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration difficulties, lightheadedness, excessive dog, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Opens to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) administered by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous dose of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with cough- and normal insulin levels.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melliestus insulin lulisin in the therapeutically relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a high dose of proportional glucosity, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosity effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a double as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosity effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that a similar postprandial glycaemic control is achieved in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-denounced control than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal, was reached.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin-lulisin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 Mi- nudes before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before beginning of the meal (Fig1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin for 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
