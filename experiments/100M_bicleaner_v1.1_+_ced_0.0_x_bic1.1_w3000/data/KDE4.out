the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or by making them easier to use .
further information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Add settings .... Open the tool@@ box Tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list with default settings modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules on your system are if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package .
in order to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; crash , or delete the list of crashes , if present .
the module View filter ( also called Ord@@ ner@@ Filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ views filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M on the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root tip of the document , example : document@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME content in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of displaying ne@@ sted hierarch@@ ies by means of a so @-@ called Tree map . tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is propor@@ tionally to its size .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . in this way , large files , even then easily recognized , can be easily identified when they are far down in the folder hierarchy .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either display depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for displaying , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles may occur ( and consequently , the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle ) can be set .
for Tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always observed . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of the entries , and this frame will need space , which is then lost to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rect@@ angle is square .
how split@@ ting the surface of an entry for the sub @-@ entries is done , the implementation remains up to date . hereby , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses due to always advantageous the areas so split@@ ting that rect@@ angles that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can specify the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ get designed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the image gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the image gallery , a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option allows you to adjust the title of the gallery page in a text input field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option images per line has a slider and a turn field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
to display the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , specify whether the file names under the thumb@@ nails will be displayed in the gallery .
to view the file size of the image , specify whether the file size is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , you indicate whether the size of the images is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog folder you specify where the gallery will be stored and which sub @-@ folders are to be included .
in the File Sel@@ ection in HTML file , enter where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the sub@@ folder check box , you can set up the sub@@ folder with a slider or a turn field , until which level the sub@@ folders are included .
copy the original images with the check box to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery .
using the commentary box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth you can set a different color depth for thumb@@ nail images than in original images .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings gives you easy access to general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; display menu under the Navigation Area window or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback .
change browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , adding browser and operating system recognition for single domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser detection of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that refuses access to this browser , change browser detection to one of the following options .
changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that refuse to access browsers based on Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not comply with the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and get your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
&amp; nbsp ; contains a fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use these to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image Plug @-@ in Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; edited ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion via li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; edited ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement options .
&amp; edited ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu provides a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all necessary information is already entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; nbsp ; is a project supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user from &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions of other users . in this mailing list however English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to get news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best way to get involved in &amp; digi@@ cam ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; edit ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; edited ; will you additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains pictures , as base folder . &amp; edited ; view each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; nbsp ; Dur@@ ing recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you can &apos;t exclude sub@@ folders unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders . this can be done by un@@ past@@ ing out one point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change it by taking any photo from the album and disc@@ arding it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; edit your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Favor@@ ites to manage your photos in the albums .
the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu help shell support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ ets and Ro@@ h sequence .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and get your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transmission to the computer the camera is often used as a disk drive . the camera can also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions over the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; edited ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support in order to read the preview images from digi@@ cam . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to do about &amp; digi@@ cam ; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plug @-@ In Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ cam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to add &amp; edit ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes were in &amp; edited ;
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drag and drop images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ tree , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to select the most common files : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works when this is displayed in the symbol view . what fields can be displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos taken by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were recorded on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the legacy properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select Album Import screen@@ shot .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album features , you must right @-@ click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a way to select your albums so that you can be group@@ ed by a common name . the collection you set will be used to sort your photos if you choose to sort or delete albums from the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used if you sort your albums by date with view albums . sort by date .
buttons El@@ ders , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last change of each file will be used in this folder instead .
if you first opened an album in &amp; quot ; open , the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select the Album button . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; nbsp ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keywords list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lu@@ pin buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album the first time , you need to wait a short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by recre@@ ating all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information on each image is displayed below the previ@@ ew@@ ed preview . what information is available can be edited by editing settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the range preview images to your preferences .
the thumb@@ nails have help buttons , which appear . if you let the mouse poin@@ ter rest for a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section introduction to the main window displays such a help window .
pictures and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to accomplish a number of improvements to them . you can access all the features with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you have the choice between viewing the pictures , a slide show or the editing of the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... Select . in the editing section , you will find a guide how to edit your photos .
you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . to do so , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , you may encounter problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data with you when you save the modified image . this information is lost from EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; nbsp ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotate . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ .@@ Del@@ ete , it is moved into the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; shifted . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; edited ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture @-@ view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed .
photos with keyword features a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or searching .
if a keyword is selected , all the photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords ; so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My Reci@@ pi@@ ts@@ quot ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the sub@@ stit@@ uting of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and disc@@ ard it . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to use &amp; digi@@ tization ; s functionality with keywords , you first need to put your photos with keywords . this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want with a keyword , you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My App@@ lic@@ ants . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and assign keywords from the context menu .
you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame that displays the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window .
in the box below , you can enter a title and save your sel@@ ections . this will then appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search did not find anything , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider on the left side bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be performed . the result will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , just select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select to edit the search , the form will appear again with the search information entered . if you select as an advanced search , the dialog for the advanced search appears to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the Search context menu .
the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ .@@ s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a query query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . any option can be added or deleted using the search group / search group . each option can be linked to other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or at least ...
&amp; nbsp ; characterized every picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar . by using a sw@@ ell@@ erts , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand paint scheme : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ cam ; find the matching images . here too , a threshold can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can move it in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it . move it while you move the left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed .
in the below field you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; nbsp ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To add the light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ .@@ Main Window , you can quickly open the light table with L Extras .
from the thumb@@ nail you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right side of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you have a preview syn@@ cing from the tool@@ bar and perform zo@@ oming or sliding operations on one of the images , then they will be compared with the other image . you can thus compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use pairing mode from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures will automatically be loaded into the areas for comparison . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it in the right panel . this simpli@@ fies to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions also work directly from the lighting table , such as F@@ 4 file ...
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to swing the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the Pre@@ view mode , both pictures will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . simply use the Zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zo@@ oming out . this happens in both pictures when you are previ@@ ew@@ ing in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - aside from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the picture has been taken to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos scans , scans or stores digital photos leads through a form of digital stock management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your images , find , protect and use photos . we will focus on the process for digital photographers which &amp; edited ; we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , backup , review , sample , archive , optim@@ ise , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , assem@@ bles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data via data . in accordance with your definition , metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use not &amp; edit ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do is the structure of information structure as opposed to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you need to switch to a larger drive sometime .
you may be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for that content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend to save metadata in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ .@@ This ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? in addition , it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now assign keywords , labels and a rating to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value .
now let &apos;s read with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ cam ; automatically build the tree for you and insert the pictures in the right place . modi@@ fying the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by moving a sub @-@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very crude representation because each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to share your photos with anyone , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I &apos;ll tell you this of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming , to have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so your perception has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your li@@ king in the label and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery system .
do you remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find in another city without a navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train of spatial presentation continues with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit ge@@ olo@@ cation are inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels via pictures with geographical data . &amp; edited ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms apply also in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ cam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to add the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work description of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mark to the author field , this must be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright paragra@@ phs , although they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this data embedded in the picture . for private persons , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; edited ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the road or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it concerns problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled cau@@ tious and you can no longer trust you than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can become un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recor@@ ders are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just written . that &apos;s why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to cause miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
do not forget to copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store them on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives :
electronic parts of the Contro@@ ll@@ ers are the most common cause of error . S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common error cause , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect this error . some of S@@ MA@@ RT &apos;s errors in particular are termin@@ ating the imminent failure . these are particularly read errors and displacement meters . the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems .
while most electrical appliances do not make a lot of power , this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high speed processes . these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe damage . thus , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able loss of time and money .
the most common protection against sp@@ ikes is a surge protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . remember , however , that not each connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage can use any cable to your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage prot@@ ectors which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in case of a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide cordless power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and shut down the system . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of current problems with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . finally , you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can install it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
compared to the hard drives at home , however , you are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures available in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the large companies in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are des@@ aster safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing about it is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all of these disorders remain und@@ et@@ ected until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . nobody seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . you will see thousands of mistakes a year already in 2010 .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license compatible with the GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the loss of data in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the wi@@ dest file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is likely to deterior@@ ate . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so secure your data often after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or res@@ izing hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a bolt strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . don &apos;t forget aircraft disasters : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a frequent reason for a loss of data despite backup is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a sn@@ apshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last full backup . generates a complete sn@@ apshot at two times : that of the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . create multiple sn@@ ap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made . this backup comes closest to a version@@ ing system closest to the exception that is only sc@@ anned and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference between files that have actually been changed .
back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly sn@@ apshot for at least one month and a sn@@ apshot for each month .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file , retain information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ discover images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
in order for valuable images to survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you must consider all that is said today with caution and re@@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available to everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have sc@@ aled the scal@@ ability and set the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g to see if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ db , the new disk is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in M@@ B@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the tire if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard to replace GI@@ F . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color allocation for hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras , you can save your images in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open @-@ screen image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block &amp; quot ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP adap@@ ts because it saves the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as indicated above , the raw format is old . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a multi @-@ lay@@ ered editing you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images with &amp; edited , then you should add the metadata again . these were under certain circumstances cut off from the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ .@@ In the addition of a photo to an album you will find a description how to add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; use it , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is established , a fer@@ al indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application of any file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry and its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information that is stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Met@@ adata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , Manufac@@ turer &apos;s Note , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . while downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the button selected is di@@ gest@@ ed until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ .@@ In this case the new pictures are marked with a star in preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you are using the buttons all or you want to download selected files , a dialog appears where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you chose the target album , press OK , and &amp; edited ; load the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only a few , you need to select them first and then delete the selected deleted .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded in a &amp; digi@@ ; -@@ album before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera , you should do this via the camera , as this is much faster .
cameras often use no meaningful names for the photos as fil@@ en@@ ames . the file names are normally recycled after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names if you load photos of various recording destinations into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the picture was taken into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub@@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day automatically .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two affect the data about the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want a different date format than the default format , e.g. in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % % H % H : % M : % S .
if you are using the option of camera fil@@ en@@ ames , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in capital letters , if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ cam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you next time open the camera window .
&amp; nbsp ; can use all information on orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not supply this information , &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , you can automatically create sub@@ albums in the target album . all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data , you can check what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually turned off , and in this case it will save &amp; edit ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you must turn this option on . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub@@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is completed , you ask &amp; digi@@ cam ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder cho@@ oser dialog appears for the camera . select the folder you want and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position specified in long@@ itude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be identified by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environment planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ cam ; users want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical allocation ( manual ) and most recently about manually entering known locations .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the geographical assignment module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the characters with ha@@ iry co @-@ ordin@@ ates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; nbsp ; It tries to give you so much control over its operations as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to set up in the Settings menu ; select Set@@ ting . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you stack the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; note if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
this field should be a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations should be registered here since this is the picture other &amp; quot ; an@@ biet@@ en@@ quot ; . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . this will ensure that metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the data base ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported without lost .
save image labels as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the labels embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; edited ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ plug ; try , you can add and remove the file extensions from this list .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Ref@@ res@@ h to the right of each category .
the settings of the light by &amp; digi@@ cam ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; load@@ en@@ quot ; you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar when you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation .
using P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , since P@@ NG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the option TI@@ FF Com@@ comp@@ ress , you can turn the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality , since the Def@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the resolution loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not been supported yet , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just one image viewer for photos . currently , it quickly becomes a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option records the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the spot@@ lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top lights , so the parts of your images that are burned out due to the inability of your camera to capture the top lights in the settings . the setting colors trigger some unusual results as it shows the top lights in various ro@@ bes .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the option of re@@ constructing , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each picture .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing . to keep the time for the demo icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data , which come from the color @-@ filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix color pixel . this algorithm is also known as a C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can put the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction as it is performed during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the color information of a color space in the other is translated to allow the colors to be as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
color profile Fol@@ ders You can set the folder here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all of your profiles . &amp; edited ; examine this folder during startup .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the shell file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures do not manage the entire screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon , which contain no color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the color mapping yourself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your picture would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . this could manually correct you instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together .
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for Land@@ sc@@ apes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules support that are written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these are then downloaded from &amp; digi@@ .@@ These modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata into one or out , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera properties appear on the left side a list of all supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the screen mode .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
if you don &apos;t , you can set camera model and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu C@@ ameras by the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can paste it all here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ figur@@ ing dialog for moving images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ cam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find further details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly accepted by &amp; digi@@ .@@ If you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise , you will need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ cam ; disable when starting . this will expe@@ dite the start @-@ up of &amp; edit ; .
the setting Bei@@ m Start after new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something from the base folder was deleted , query &amp; digi@@ kam ; you , if it is to delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; edited , to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar under Settings Design . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ cam ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; nbsp ; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the item ad / editing .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ .@@ You may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the section image editing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , displaying file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and current image size .
a menu bar at the top , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
you should then make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ producing from the File menu or use the button Rest@@ ore the Image Processing Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last save .
almost every action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edi@@ ting undo or restoring by selecting Edi@@ ting from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and recognize C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB , press a moment longer via the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the size of the window , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ magni@@ fication factor Automati@@ cally
view Full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you do not want this , you can change it in the settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the picture in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single pictures or whole sentences . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select print coach from the Album Export menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation arrows , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the edge again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible , which means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated to 2000 characters and special characters are res@@ h@@ aped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented on it , either use the user button or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
next to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the Evaluation section displays a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the valuation is written in the IP@@ TC field of Ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the Key@@ word tree and a selection box with the keywords used before ; -@@ session applied verb@@ s .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can easily restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword ( IP@@ TC ) .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keywords , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please read the Key@@ word filter section .
the Key@@ word filtering side@@ bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , date , keywords and searches . if in addition one or more keywords are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed .
you can also draw and drop keywords . in the main view , you have selected several images to provide you with keywords . if the keyword exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the Key@@ word filter refers to No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that a keyword has been drawn from the right sample tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled under Settings Differ@@ ent .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or its , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and control area .
( 1 ) : the entry according to which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly made it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resemble those from your camera or scanner and that the colours you print or publish in the web that are of your digital dark@@ room .
when the subject comes to color management , everybody wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow ful@@ fills all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color administration .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information below )
your only other image output is e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so simple , why should one use a different color space and thus have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent page and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to turn my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to sound your monitor because s@@ RGB is emit@@ ting your monitor . if you are working as a s@@ RGB colour space , you must either turn your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting to manually edit .
the functions Norm@@ alize , balance , Automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction attempt automatically to make the best of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aling the Leu@@ st@@ stär@@ ling values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot becomes as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out .
balance : this method converts the intensity factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . it sometimes produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in a picture or destroyed it .
automatic scanning : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
enlarge Con@@ trast : this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a re@@ plen@@ ishment of all values in between . this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can do the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side both the original image and preview of the target image can be seen . the preview will dynamically change the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the upper right there is a hist@@ ogram that is dynamically changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values will also be set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the Pre@@ ferences list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and Load are doing exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved in a text file and relo@@ ad it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will give another photo than your original . if you save these settings your original image will be changed .
8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time , and stands only for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool will open the same dialog as editing raw images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . colour mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the color management chapter .
another important tool can be found in the menu under color tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and also allows you to save your settings so that you can always use them for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same error and therefore always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the gra@@ dation tool that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tools color effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar control effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created by explo@@ iting a partially developed print from the additional light . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas were dark@@ ened and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the pol@@ arization . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar efficiency effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply , it embelli@@ shes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for natural photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ance of the photos . you can click to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors .
if you do a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too great satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform can be previ@@ ew@@ ed . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tools Gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / G@@ amma the tool is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complex , you only need the area of the slider for the application purpose described here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three slider are cli@@ cked into and shifted to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn to operate is to shift the controller and make sure the picture changes .
on the right hand side , the original and previ@@ ew@@ ing of the picture can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image . on the left hand , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear narrative is often the most useful . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the compression of the output values can , for example , be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and relo@@ aded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input will be automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to place the entries of the Hist@@ o@@ gram for Rot@@ - , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available :
modify channel : this box allows the channel to be specified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker tones and that the corresponding image pixels become darker .
preview the original photos is a red marker to see . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and solar tones . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; edited channel mixer ; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender for image editing .
the channel selection box allows you to select the colour for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with one &apos;s rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for Red , Green and Building allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you change the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient if you also activate the Mon@@ ochro@@ me option because the channel bl@@ ender then is THE tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colored . colored is made of small noise @-@ files that do not occur at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color noise first .
the Save As and Shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been newly adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the modified image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green l@@ enti@@ l filter . this looks good , with all the scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . thus , similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate moon light scenes at day@@ time . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ thel@@ ia : generates warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit cold in the sh@@ aded tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and the re@@ development in a squ@@ am@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) sc@@ epi@@ ph@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , stit@@ ching an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep your attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the scat@@ tering eye . in the picture frame , the module can be started from image editing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture . outline the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce outline it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bot@@ ched it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a but@@ ton@@ effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns .
width : determines the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio previously used .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any location . this also goes to multiple places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from color space and character set with its properties as you need it . the bigger the picture , the bigger the character set must be . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any setting you choose for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply tool sten@@ cil , you can lay a template over an image .
the image template menu apply in image editing can be used to lay templates over an image .
for templates there are no limitations concerning the size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button basic folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings are marked for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail .
there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is perhaps the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process colors need to be summari@@ zed with only minimal differences to one color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally need more than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images , a camera is often used for internal sharp@@ ness . in contrast , images in the raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a sharp@@ ness filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing value . you can call this with the menu entry Do@@ gs .
however , you should handle this carefully because the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the edge of the edges , but also strengthens the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image is re@@ focusing . you can re@@ focus more information and compare all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten sof@@ tly with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ise sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount enhances the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , rou@@ gh@@ ness and the impression of gr@@ ates will create close to sharp edges .
the radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference @-@ amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore beauty fla@@ ws in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the bl@@ unt mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the modified image the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool re@@ focusing re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected removal filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focusing usually reaches better results than bl@@ urred . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result from the source pix@@ ies far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; s folding is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the remote pixels .
circular focus : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further mi@@ tig@@ ate the image .
G@@ auss &apos;s edge : this is the radius for the G@@ auss edge . use this parameter if your bl@@ ur is gau@@ ze . in most cases , you should let this value 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gau@@ ze &apos;s edge . however , note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , colour and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible , but which later left uncomfortable art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ k@@ ieren produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mask use a bigger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter one can show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Vienna Film is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Vienna filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters applied on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the field correction methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoo@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulator sets the bl@@ ur of the area of the dark@@ ened area to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ink ink allows a modified colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most widely developed tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail preservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ thing over the image . whereas larger values are mainly homo@@ geneous regions smoo@@ thing and details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details so that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary retro@@ spec@@ tively .
direction depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film grain or a CCD diamond will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value close to 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value to match the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns bigger structures . the higher this value , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it has to be higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is tra@@ vers@@ ed . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient here .
angle @-@ incre@@ ment da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by choosing this option is minimal . however , it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to leave it out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save as and Load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons do exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and relo@@ aded later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with little art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City by an analog camera . as you see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the background that caused by a bad film shift during the trip . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise noise . it uses a proprietary copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other arti@@ facts from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ windows details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters per pixel need and can wipe the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller errors adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel distance to the front to detect lumin@@ escence changes . if it is increased , noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and rou@@ gh@@ ness or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the whole noise cannot be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ ash or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically bol@@ ted more strongly . however , it also s@@ me@@ ars the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase adjustment . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may occur at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this .
store under and load : these buttons are used for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to sof@@ ten sof@@ tly with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ise sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s h@@ iss , film gran@@ ul@@ ts , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ ts@@ quot ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting is intended to correct these problems .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and relo@@ aded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious filming on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool Hot@@ pixel makes it possible to remove Hot@@ pixel from photos taken with a CCD camera gem , eight . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photographs because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file into the wizard with the dark@@ image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark@@ picture directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark@@ image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all the preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead , vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ i quot ; ( shad@@ owing ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reaching the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
but it also has disadvantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also use a center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise the sharp@@ est effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s felt and color depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation on a rough image that was done without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controls , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which is equivalent to an optical filter with a lens setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ ette , reduce it to compensate for a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image using the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ sting of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction to be applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ des covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third grade has a similar round effect , but fla@@ ws at the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the co@@ efficient of engraved edge correc@@ ts the removed corners opposite the second gra@@ dient . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated .
in general : this value checks the strength of the distortion second grade . with negative values , t@@ onal distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value checks the strength of the distortion fourth degree . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners &apos; parameters have the reverse sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
bri@@ gh@@ tening : this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your picture are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the clay or kis@@ sing @-@ shaped correction should be performed before any cutting or res@@ izing changes . best perform this correction as the first . if you cut a picture new and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would be apparent .
to help you find the best correc@@ tions , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea border or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you rec@@ tify a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the Edit menu , Cut crop out of image processing or zoom regul@@ ators of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motives , such as pictures from the front , frame and paintings it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the image have 90 degrees . please note that if you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below previ@@ ew@@ ing you can set two parameters setting film bas@@ kets and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the merge movie gran@@ ul@@ ator option if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film bas@@ kets and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the modified image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter Fil@@ ters is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ul@@ ts on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver particles of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to post@@ p@@ one back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , stre@@ et@@ photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the film sensitivity used corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter oil paintings create the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large pictures . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processor is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smoo@@ thes 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal ore . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you .
there are two controls with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pen size and the bottom adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ y landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copyright protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks .
waves 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using the im@@ bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom : sharp@@ ens the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one central point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ urs the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance @-@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
motion bl@@ ur@@ ring : wi@@ pes the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ tening bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ urs the image soft into the dark and strongly in the light tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shaking : bl@@ urs the image through random shifting of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary moving camera .
smart for@@ sharp@@ ness : find the color pool in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses a proprietary algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow along with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing will keep an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the modified image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning in the right direction . the tools for this can be found in the menu Transform@@ ating Tur@@ ning or Trans@@ forming mirrors .
photo magni@@ fier is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ invent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in tab New Size and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is checked , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it has to be higher than 3 .
buttons Save as and Load are used precisely for this purpose . each st@@ amping for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as a text file and relo@@ aded later .
blowing photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo magni@@ fication by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture . to cut a photo , simply use the mouse to create just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and moving the rect@@ angle . you &apos;ll see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
you can change the size of the area to be overl@@ apping by drawing at the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by simply holding the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the C@@ tr@@ l ; + X button to cut image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the File Save or File Save File menu in the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inches , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio knob set the area for cutting to the wi@@ dest possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
cutting the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ on@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly help enable you to blend aids so that you can better assemble your pictures . these help are :
harmonious triangle : harmonious tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonic tri@@ angles aligned on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spir@@ als of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the gold center provides fluid relief lines if you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads to the viewer &apos;s look along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river on this type .
another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . this rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye is at the center of the composition .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the gold spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place these lines can be made a static object more dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break up your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles .
the Horiz@@ on@@ tal options mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tions .
with the button color you can set the colour of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can become invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform the free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right side .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you shot an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair this is to use the function Trans@@ former cutting from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the Automati@@ cally Cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after rotation . however , note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels .
angle left at the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image gets a little bl@@ urred . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming trimm@@ ing from image processing .
the sc@@ oring tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal pattern , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted .
shoot your image by using horizontal and vertical angles . if you click pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sc@@ oring tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sc@@ aling , the picture gets caught a little bit . for a single loop this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two lines generating twice as much confusion and therefore you should avoid this .
after sc@@ aling the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming trimm@@ ing from image processing .
&amp; Edi@@ ting ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , compiled from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ cam ;
due to this depen@@ dency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system , but you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; nbsp ; shows only files in formats that you know . this is done by file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; edited ; change the file in image editing . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; edited ; see Con@@ figuration section for more information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; edited ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss@@ less if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read very helpful instructions in English under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ .@@ In the configuration section you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the store of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is included in &amp; digi@@ .@@ You can see more than 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be seen below on Dave Coff@@ in &apos;s web page . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ cam ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often recorded in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; edited ; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in capabilities to display or edit movies .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast has been very good , then you can do the first four adjustments with the white balance module .
many tools you need to do the photo editing are in &amp; edited ; their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft character , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , Un@@ sharp masks , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ den@@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower one to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and put aside the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side bar features the essential information on the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data stem from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can move it in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it . move it while you move the left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ let files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ etten files installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folder for files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pal@@ let view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described under the pal@@ let view . here , too , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box When Cur@@ sor is added under the color button , the color will be inserted from the color table on the cur@@ sor . the color will either be inserted or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing was selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box under the cur@@ sor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character , if another color follows .
the colors in the palette and the colour selection output can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program used to view &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ gra@@ phs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program , which &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; includes , are out@@ dated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; -@@ project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; shows graph@@ ene with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; Po@@ sters ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in graph@@ ene in &amp; out ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in a nut@@ shell ; -@@ component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to represent more than these k@@ not )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . requires in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in a separate sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without starting a argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only contains the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; old ; button ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file was modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be relo@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Pre@@ ferences k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; set up ... use , see also .
when you open a graph@@ ite file outside a current &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , or want to present the graphs to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but change it with the setup dialog afterwards .
when starting the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to one page will be adjusted to this page . if you retain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with a different font
the Ref@@ t Shop page gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been modified to the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically relo@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program each time .
the opening page gives the option to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time it is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session ) or decide to be asked at every start afterwards .
the context menu , which normally appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n , opens up more possibilities :
here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directional graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge tri@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ lighted graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the jump spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spring @-@ spring model for un@@ developed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man pure gold ho@@ ur@@ istic , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the node in a circular shape according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and print the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms change special options , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the particular type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ coated graph@@ ene ) .
if this setting is checked , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the -@@ mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source directory &apos;s base folder .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphi@@ c@@ viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find further options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main tool bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the color palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol .
create a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears where you can choose whether the symbol should be created from a template , or if you want to start anew from scratch .
restore the last backward step . if you don &apos;t have a step back , this function is de@@ activated .
adds the cli@@ p@@ board contents as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray scales . this can create colors that do not coinci@@ de with those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current character color on the color of the dot on which you click .
the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current canvas , the magni@@ fying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
adds the cli@@ p@@ board contents as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for icons , background and tool@@ bars .
with buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
select Transpar@@ ent pixels or display rulers and display one @-@ color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a banner display . you can also adjust the size for the ch@@ ess@@ board : the Kar@@ os to Klein , Medium and Groß as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose .
the K@@ IP@@ I module contains tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . for this to work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item images , a dialog appears that allows you to choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by using the default duc@@ r@@ he default values to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you start scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the button Scan@@ nen , you must wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the target image . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore very large files created . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
screen shots can be created after you have selected in the Import &gt; Screen Sa@@ ver menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
when all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear to allow you to view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window under the mouse is read .
the delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts . if you have to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen shot has been shot , the dialog box appears with the options described above .

if you choose to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos before up@@ loading will be changed in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is modified so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export has no documentation at this time . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical location loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Gali@@ le@@ o . height , lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the dialog to see above appears then . to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file naturally contains data that were recorded at the same locations at the same time as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is executed which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the maximum time devi@@ ation is an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from one place for pictures , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in min can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually using this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since dialog is the co @-@ ordin@@ ates from one call to the next you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . for this purpose , select the region and increase it . always select it again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely out of the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in an image gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
the panel selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the Ap@@ pear@@ ance Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be created in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show
the Ri@@ der album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Suite containing everything will be created there .
if you have selected JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth . this naturally also affects the file size . all other settings are explan@@ atory .
the rider preview images will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically launched at the end to view the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and p@@ yl@@ ons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , as no compression of the color information takes place . this can also be found in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client does not yet have documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please take a look at ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ coder module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG En@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add a basic image transition between the single images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that will be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can start creating the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures you selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also modify the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should choose the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to re@@ play the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture will be displayed . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the m@@ peg output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as much as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . once you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can start creating the movie with the button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or calm@@ ly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if a critic appears that coding or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the Settings button below .
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import / convert your images stored in RA@@ W format to one of three formats such as JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame will remain the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged image format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your images frequently or further use them later , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to retain the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the output button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
the stac@@ king mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the convert program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the picture smaller or enlarge .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : not proportional scale change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre @-@ preparation : prepare the picture for the photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
once you have started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the pictures you have selected . you can add more images using the button Add images . for the last selected image , a preview will be shown on the right .
you can also draw images to the picture list and put them there to add you to the list of images to be sent .
removing images removes the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the pictures , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject here . the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments .
make sure you don &apos;t send too many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of emails to send . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is saved and used each time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu Pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . therefore , you should use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut , so that you can view the status messages , searching for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have your slide show appears . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here .
the Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation activate very elegant image transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have an appropriate graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Show File Name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the loop option lets you display the presentation in an endless loop . you can then manually termin@@ ate it with Es@@ c .
the option Pictures random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the images in the album .
between the pictures , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , at any transition between the pictures select another effect .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on .
with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop interface .
once you have completed your pictures and videos with notes , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse them , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , now in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in group keywords entries are available .
in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current thumb@@ nails .
if you click on the entry with the mouse , the browser view changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images on which both individuals are visible . by using this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the published context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you will need to specify which image should be displayed for each individual . to do this , you will need to open the Picture @-@ View window ( in closer description ) and select the image for the corresponding person . in the View window , you can customize the image for the corresponding person . in the View window , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
if you search for the entry in the main window , a dialog appears to you which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can see this dialog again on the picture .
if you enter a string into the let@@ tering or description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all the pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals but rather want to try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ demo . then , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name says , this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database .
you can switch between the sessions , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview button ) and the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drawing the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline data . if you select an area , you will see only pictures of this time period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create via the File HTML menu ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described in more detail .
first , enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created that is visible on the overview page . you will find more information about the export files in .
finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed which is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are of a party . note that all pictures are exported . therefore , you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages are to look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically discussed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so , it can search your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , set the various folders and the URL where your site is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can either select a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , will start . otherwise , the web browser should be in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . to enable the import feature , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all three based on base folders or URLs . a sub@@ folder is created in them , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; together , you might want to create your pictures with these . you can of course create an HTML page for viewing the images . however , if you have already spent a lot of time viewing the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not be done again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if only a link to images is stored in the file . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the pictures together and this file can be passed so independently . the obvious draw@@ back is however the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can view from the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is intended for internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
in the manual Man@@ ually close to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with option Automati@@ cally copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you still want this , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import ... select , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the assistant to import consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alise the category of people belonging to the im@@ porting file ( if you are a domain ) while this category is called people . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories will match those in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture .
it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside various picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , via ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your images . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all of its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder in which your images are stored and use it automatically in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; i.e. , start a different folder with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings are explained .
to the left you see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing the F1 button and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete groups of members , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of explaining all groups of a member as explained .
in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ cam and g@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used by several applications among each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should first test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures The &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database can either be viewed via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage of sharing functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications are arran@@ ging their pictures in albums . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this sort of order isn &apos;t supported , it simul@@ ates the order of albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to hand over a list of albums .
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , if you use the category people , you will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so if you would have selected people to view and pass on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . below the tool@@ bar , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but first click on the entry picture , which shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . you can either individually or for a larger number of pictures put certain notes at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen were recorded .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
this is a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , since you can use it again and again if you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : if you have for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are depicted , you can , by making the used names moved up , find the persons faster and assign them .
if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected pictures and add these pictures with notes . in this case , simply click on the front and back buttons that are located at the top of the picture .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you see a browser window displaying the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry to a category and put it there to make it a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... which offers , among other things , the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options ... and click here to show / hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture .
when you select the images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected pictures , or any of the pictures if you have not set a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now the window will show you that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , namely images even without having you stored on the hard drive . of course you need to have the pictures somewhere saved to record it in the database index . in the picture you see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures where the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk . this is , for example , with the images 1 @-@ 9 . for the images 5 @-@ 9 , however , thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files out of folders and copy them back into it . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; does it still not support you to insert the CD in question . so , if you want to avoid trouble such as the mess of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those remaining you want to make for others un@@ available and click on the latest view blocks in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also use all the pictures that your little sister may see , control and lock the menu entry everything except current view .
so you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry to block images , so that all the images you have locked are hidden . if you want to get the pictures again , click Lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select Password in the Privacy menu .
please note that this picture protection is by no means very secure . for one , all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection serves only to forbi@@ d those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to forbi@@ d the view of private pictures .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason , you have a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in the picture . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered via the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all of these options are available right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the matching entries to this display . so , if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu .
when several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can move in and zoom out . to zoom out , you can move a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus key , you can zoom out again . the plus button zoom in the middle of the picture .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the Power button sets the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the functions from the context menu you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can preview the image and open configuration dialog to enter this name . however , you may prefer to highlight just the picture and look at more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while watching them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letters . in this you see a picture in which the characteristics A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have features on your images , these are available to you in the browser . so if you have all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , simply put all at once with notes . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview . if you want to display categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you will allow you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album to paint on the picture .
the batch will not be saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can rever@@ t your painted old later .
in order to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; turn on the picture from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully mastered , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is displayed yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to allow you to choose the correct position :
by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to adopt these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message with an error description will be displayed . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or disc@@ ard the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; set user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , check locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse throughout the window .
each object has a level of visibility as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the super@@ ordin@@ ate object , or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed when selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the visibility stage selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window ordering as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window system or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust it arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or under a existing view , drag the an@@ cker to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to assign multiple views to one another , drag the an@@ cker in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flash@@ cards at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are ho@@ vering views : views that are not anchored in the main window . in order to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the an@@ cker on the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left in the cham@@ fer strip .
to close a view click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
the current window view allows you to store windows an@@ ode ... store . it will display a dialog where you can store the windows order under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 updated . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported .
to render the current scene click on the Ren@@ dering icon The icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry View scene .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense , however , a name that lets you see the properties of the mode .
in the size chart , you can enter the width and height of the rendered picture . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in the quality combination field you can select the properties that are used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection illumination . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User Manual to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . in general , pictures with this property look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super sampling refers to the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because each pixel is always re@@ distributed and adaptive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels that are individually tra@@ cked and checked for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called j@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason for this here .
to import an &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry File Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in Property View , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Li@@ br@@ aries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects , such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross the high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window instructions , explain how to create and store window orders .
the standard window system drop @-@ down sel@@ ector : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window ordering at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window instructions . a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
every window ordering is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window system . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button removal .
the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with a card map you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and flo@@ ats the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; inst@@ alls and now you want to start without precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level .
but you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in darkness and you will only get a black image .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , you can see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et windows order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application as well .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this tutorial , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wireless model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see for more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position .
when you apply the Apply button or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert final body boxes ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the level , although at the moment only a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the object properties view .
in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple .
in both cases a dialog opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted . please select first sub @-@ object . the pigment will then change in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , by clicking on the button preview , you can see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the box and the ball in the preview , just click on the button Apply and then preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called single @-@ color . in the object tree you have to do the entry color list . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select one each time and change the colors in the object properties view :
you should already be able to carry out this step , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be just as simple as the floor :
in the object properties view , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the user button ) , so the ball has contact to the ground . otherwise , the ball would ho@@ ver over the ground as you have moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course the rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface looks like a matt black material . in the next step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the floor , give the ball a pigment as color :
choose first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in ball Pig@@ ment . click on the Pig@@ ment sphere , then select one color and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the input key .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if Met@@ alli@@ c : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ er is a render method to create a two dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the rendering of hypo@@ the@@ tical rays shoots from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effects .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a source of light you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that is to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and will replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you do not have saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Un@@ usual .
stores the current pane order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , key short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog for modi@@ fying the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new short@@ commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; add and remove commands .
a dump map is a way to make rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both dump map and texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
pictures can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all pictures should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . if a suitable file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in Dialog Ein@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , download &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you are still looking at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if window mode is larger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up only some of the file types that the program can also display .
with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the various operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
decreases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is also closed when no browser window is open .
show the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .

&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you so much control over its operations as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; to access these settings , you need to set up the settings show@@ shot ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the exposure indicators you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should show the colors with what you want to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a light color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; features a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; gu@@ lite ; is an application to scan images that do not make more than scan and save images .
&amp; h@@ lite ; is a simple application to scan images that do not make more than images to scan and save . &amp; h@@ lite ; can open a dialog for saving any image or save images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of supporting your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; h@@ lite ; with the command sc@@ lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner has been specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; gu@@ lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not deal with these options .
to scan an image , the user can start a preview scan and then scan for the final scan . preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window .
once the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview in the settings is selected , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you get back to the main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected Before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the way &amp; channel lite ; to select images . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sam@@ lite ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without asking a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the images that are automatically stored and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored picture gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is uploaded each time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; h@@ lite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE about dialog for &amp; h@@ lite ; the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; h@@ lite ; .

Select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; short commands work . this allows you to make your keyboard to &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control centre .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are usually found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function could look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; Amar@@ ok also has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog to allow the user to know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow execution of external programs and commands . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be accessed relatively easily . here an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the default setting of the script . for this reason , scripts should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events when there is no use for it .
configure Soft the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , ask more information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be selected . in order to add an own entry to the menu , you can use the D@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . to remove one entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; termin@@ ated , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to do , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script pack@@ ets downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will accept only script pack@@ ets with the capture amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script pack@@ ets right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can attach it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you &apos;re just looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s Collec@@ ting browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
you may have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which ones you want to listen to ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music based on specific criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used to choose how you want to listen to your music . these and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ experience your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake do not have any trouble to compile . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . for details , see the System Pre@@ ferences section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in developing &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you should use full .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
if the option is disabled , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches on the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
disc@@ ord files from the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the preferences folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k needs to be started when a browser is required .
use another browser : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save playlist when moving , automatically save the current playlist by pressing &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when moving .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files will be saved .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece changes visible in order to keep the play@@ lists window open / un@@ rolled in order to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area .
when changing the context browser , automatically change the context browser when the next piece is set .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; use the otherwise gray shown section . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist window , player windows and context browser . press Select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of user defined color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme . to do so , use the color selection below for foreground and background color .
resume playing at the start , that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; after the program start , resume playback automatically with the piece at the place , with which it was stopped at the last stop .
set up the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is applied , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color sel@@ ections . if your own colors are not activated , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the display text input field displays the text shown in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ card holders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify the screen of a multiple monitor environment to make the O@@ SD appear .
the audio output card allows you to select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers have further adjustments in this chart .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for music files . to include a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively browse sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; adding all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will later appear in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l facility .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set the database for &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; on calcul@@ ator : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then it is entered under port : the network port under which the database is available . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and , if required , create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your User@@ name and Password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send the played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
invo@@ ke similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; a list of similar performers to the played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m @-@ profile to use this function .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and other K@@ DE packages . so you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ ume that your window manager considers the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work for instance . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
this is mostly due to the fact that tag@@ li@@ b crashes while reading the met@@ a @-@ info@@ s from this file . please report this error to the tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is somewhat more sophisticated .
make sure that all libraries used by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X compiled , this leads to crashes when editing Met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then de@@ activate autom@@ . dis@@ connect if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email opens automatically when a crash occurs ) . if it is a common crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ info , but do not label them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script sol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl @-@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s icons are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten . in some cases , you have to click on a symbol until three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set Pix@@ elation ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to find the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems clarify most easily by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # am@@ aro@@ k .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please make only one mistake there , if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , only a blank playlist will appear . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to intui@@ tively keep the surface intuitive , the start window has been converted into the stati@@ stic window . you can find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show review . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the review for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Del@@ f on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your choice and then select from playlist remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist with the mouse and drop it down there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s as simple as : - )
in the playlist of the playlist , next to the Add @-@ button , the Play@@ list button is stored . click on it .
you probably lack the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel program . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also check for lib@@ x@@ . this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be : which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! perhaps you will use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 decoder can be supplied ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 node , input key
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ sin@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; already . don &apos;t forget that media will need to be de@@ coded first . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs that can cause distorted playback . read this bug report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you don &apos;t use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less wear@@ er re@@ acts the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to go to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you will need to register all the components . follow the registry to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask at the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download am@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all the ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the sc@@ m@@ peg @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
please report under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k player play
this command lets &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find out the currently in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; running titles when you are on another computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user your@@ username am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ playing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; window can be separated . to do so , press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right mouse button turns a piece in the queue into the queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and playlist have tricky features , but how does it look with the icon in the control bar system segment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the launch of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , you instead take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; ) F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( Esc@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically , this fits the previous rating with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual review has on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all the other attributes , namely by selecting the right mouse button on the piece and editing : select the rating or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the metadata dialog .
developers do not want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a set release plan that is not to be brought together with the short @-@ term scheduled plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . disable the option icon while playing anim@@ ate in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool bar . select Set Settings tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context browser design , click New Design ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ ors navigation range allows you to monitor and control &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; while browsing in Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click on the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add am@@ aro@@ k in the Add @-@ up menu .
audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free user name and password . audio c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; re@@ installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
probably use a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . you now have to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to be able to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you will get the error there is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator . then start Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set up in Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output gives you the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ smart 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the x@@ ine setup dialog , enter us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check@@ box at sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio issue with Arts will not be taken care of . of course you are allowed to take this issue by hand ! if you would like , you can become the new so urgently needed supervis@@ or for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there &apos;s the setup wizard that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in a few minutes .
to create a playlist is very simple . use the mouse entries from the collection browser into the playlist . tap into the text box , so the tree view will only display the remaining matching entries . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have the option to import play@@ lists enabled , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view .
to play an audio CD , please select actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the playback button .
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audio oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all drivers available .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have different options for burning a CD .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed which make work with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( such as RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , it also has &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; however , a playlist that is superior to everyone else .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; Control Centre . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including the running text display . you can switch from the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button .
the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the running text display , you can also use the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used for setting E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece posi@@ tional slide bar . use the slide bar to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playing and change to the next or previous piece .
the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the equ@@ ali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that are in no other player . but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side is the navigation pane . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser displays various information about the current piece . its look can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you might notice that the sub@@ window is ki@@ cked off . the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in addition , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information on the current piece . see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view cover images in the context browser , the cover pictures must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ ec@@ es are the favourite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current performer .
you can set which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last part , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current performer you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be folded up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if you don &apos;t have a text script , you can choose which one should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database . no running text script is required to do so .
the search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com according to the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First pieces are arranged according to performers , and there will be another distribution according to the album . if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Differ@@ ent Interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / year - Album - Sor@@ ted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them according to artist &apos;s interpretation .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is also sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically record your collection as soon as you change something at the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while .
there is a search filter directly under the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes on how to use this filter can be found in the playlist section in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection box , which allows you to filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can choose from various time windows , ranging from the last 24 hours to a year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order into play .
attached to play@@ lists - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry , you reach the same effect .

burn all pieces of this performer / burn on CD - Therefore the selected pieces will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files in the garbage bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selected album as a composition , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under different interpre@@ ters .
pick up a compilation selection - Change a compilation labeled Album back to a normal album . after that the album will no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the associated performer .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
also self @-@ created Intelli@@ gent play@@ lists are possible . click on Intelli@@ gent Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new Intelli@@ gent Play@@ list . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , it must be embedded in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sorted in the top list view of the Media Player Browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list performer . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar , there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser you can find a address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press input key , you can access music in the file musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it . in this case , holding the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply moving the entries with the mouse and dropping it . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty .
if you enter into spaces separate search terms , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; searching for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
for example , one OR two OR 3 . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination ) are found .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , please complete the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not by entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the keyword : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bad .
you can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click on the entries with the right mouse button in the desired order . the entries will then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist .
next , the buttons follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .

if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats then remember that you will receive a worse quality when renew@@ ing to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created from a loss @-@ ha@@ iled format .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has completed the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable install of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after having made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog window you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the original is completed into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD @-@ medium to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; Bur@@ ns the image file . you now have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; Bur@@ ns the image file . you now have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS with your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums and learn about news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; so chooses &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality in burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ oder and En@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD .
SO@@ X : an utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
Trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a feature @-@ full auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to relo@@ ad recently opened projects . the accompanying sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on one entry will open the project .
saves the current project . once the project has been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Store is displayed , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for every single project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project has been changed and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then choose between saving and making changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what should happen with it , as if you have called for any project file close .
closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project is asked what should happen , as if you had called File C@@ lose .
if you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you directly drag the files from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to run the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described by what is that ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you merge files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session are always included , even if this function is not used .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this feature removes no files from the media , it only hides the previously imported files .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD that you can then burn later on . additionally , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows even without a project file to copy a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also create an image of a DVD that you can then burn later on . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the contents will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog qu@@ ires after an * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
the dialog qu@@ ires after an * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even ways to change the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the content view allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view .
the head bar is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key signature for it below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this you need system administrator rights , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and to fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is equipped like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface parts of functionality can , for example , be controlled by a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line , or use the more convenient K@@ d@@ co@@ p program . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task is critical , which of the accompanying programs give you the default .
in this chapter we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following to the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other features for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project @-@ method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ projection interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fi@@ le.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ visual ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the en@@ coder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ visual ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many coding that these WAV files code ( comp@@ ressing ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ heim for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) is standard@@ ly supported ( these coding packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more coding can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or other formats such as the loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ guides ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ to ( for O@@ GG ) or other coding will have to be installed . all of these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , only the coding packages must be installed that are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to coding , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audio@@ visual ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does not cover the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass a protected audio CD ; in any case , &amp; k@@ audio@@ guides ; even avoid buying copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , afterwards the daily use of reading a &amp; CD is explained on the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which code@@ c programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
if the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data starts to set up a request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - when an en@@ coder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup catalog - the encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so selecting with a different en@@ coder can be read as the default . it is important to note that previously the en@@ coder was configured in the code encoding settings in the setup dialog .
open the file manager so that an already read file will be selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , platforms ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; quit ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ guides ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the en@@ coder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate differences are less important as both codes generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still included with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if there is one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices like standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression ratio up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR Common Stereo , compression ratio approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music by young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or automatically fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / use with &amp; k@@ audio@@ visual ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the codes and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ visual must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ guides ; parameters that can be used ( = button identification in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / input information , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translators : this is the author ) am not attorney . however , nobody can prevent you from being har@@ med by the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ visual ; is active a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b you can use another ( fake ) address than the used in the system . in this mode of configuration , it seems , the email address will not be used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( but this can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ guides ; used to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online recall of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what output program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to know more precisely in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see also note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the right distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done .
for saving the read WAV files , the coding and thus the desired file format can be selected . in the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ heim ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the encoding . other codes can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the coding can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined codes . more information on Ko@@ di@@ erer is available in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a code , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . thereby &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed code .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio codes of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ heim for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that might indicate what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
did you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to produce MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ guides ; something that is probably just done once , and
the second section describes the procedure to read out a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each subsequent &amp; CD .
here we determine the encoding to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy , we share the program with fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; download data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them on any read @-@ out of a &amp; CD if the appropriate settings are found once .
the device name will be passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map General Settings . here there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left as left / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information inqu@@ ire , so that you will be notified when information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download over the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : while reading the &amp; CD , the computer must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is simpler , will be a &amp; CD ; associated entry starts immediately to read the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later un@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b local in offline mode if you download the database before . however , it is over 6@@ 20 MB , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data should get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as illustrated in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , but as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the internet .
in this example we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so simply try yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to check out the &amp; CD ; to disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is average around 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files at the same time : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one wa@@ v file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ guides ; this configuration is used as a standard for every read of a &amp; CD ; if you chose the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you will never need to change it again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create and set up MP3 files . first , a connection to the Internet is structured as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from those obtained for a &amp; CD ; with success from fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . hence , you will learn the &amp; CD ; to manually input data instead of picking them out of the internet . comments will indicate the differences .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; find this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD now has to be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this is only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , look for help in the section Ques@@ tions and answers or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all songs are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ref@@ res@@ h Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ guides ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see the help file to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the issuing CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information on the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the window of the CD editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . just click on the line to select the piece . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
if the selection process has been started by clicking on the selection button , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and trace what is going on .
click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you can see this error message when trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have typ@@ ed here in the example . do you have checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this lets you read and encoding parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
now the last title is read out while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is in the queue of the code . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ visual , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the coding of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ visual ; is maintained within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audio@@ guides ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to people compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help just how the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls out many different programs has many variations in settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any c@@ lue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program starts ) or from the unusually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : sorry , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ visual . anyone who wants to add or change something useful may do it . at least only after cont@@ acting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange , if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player by &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , he also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is involved as soon as there is a sequ@@ encer support .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop to drag &amp; drop you to &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window can drag on k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
session support . when you quit &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows will drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Ab@@ play in the tool@@ bar , select the record from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( for several pieces , you will be added to a collection and then played one after another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and driving back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the speed display and so change the playing speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure appears on the space bar like a print on the pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts the play . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in one piece of music in two ways . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics event and again others both . some pieces do not have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which one song uses , so that you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the entry automatic text selection . however , if you select the entry automatic text selection in the Settings menu , you will still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up an event type , select the entries of text events and song events from the Settings menu . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files you sum@@ mar@@ ise . these are played back in turn . this section shows how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the Collection menu under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the one you want in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection you will find all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not stored . keep in mind when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you need to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to the Add @-@ on button . there , in turn , you can select the file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is checked , a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not checked , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song further , select the next song button , the next song from the menu item , or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the Previous item , the previous one from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map converts general @-@ MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that transforms all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequis@@ ite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; A further Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compliant .
in this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) which sounds similar to a gun .
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the note 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that with the term drum patch the patch is meant , where each sound is a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , as well as its presence , so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . take a look , for example , the supplied keywords .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply use the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped onto the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the keyword must be defined further forward in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event with the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM indicates that a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try .
to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you will find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see what sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have modified an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select the channel view : settings
the Tempo @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
OK , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow keys to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the standard tempo , double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( when I play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file , just change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ M. , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so you set the Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ S@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , that encourages me to continue to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.com Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy simply write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really enjoy a huge joy when sending me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file will be listed under friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me , because I might have the file already .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and didn &apos;t get money from anyone for it . I would like to emphasize that I just keep programming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
my thanks also goes to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Magn@@ us Wes@@ thei@@ der , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course , my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on his homepage , which is found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view images . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music of course .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you right click on an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the selected entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can also be changed from the View menu and next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , it must be selected from the Edit menu with playlist and choose either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost if the editing mode leaves or another group is selected without the same with the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some features can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files .
animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will keep the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be disturbing at the end animation , the user can therefore end the application for a second time .
a simple example of a startup animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ verter &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / k@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt

there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , such as setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments from K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if no errors occur here , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
for example , this should be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be played by TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the device to be used must be used and the TV channels need to be used , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port should be used . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be found ( e.g. PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( presumably this type of playing video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ format must be fully functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
at the time of creating this documentation , dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ec@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
is there any hint how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command can be run as root user after connecting the device . it is essential to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts slowly , why does my CPU need to be checked for performance each time ?
note : the answer is over@@ dated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer needs automatically the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; dump ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . on Unix @-@ like systems , probably the package &amp; tex@@ live ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) is used .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the box ; web site should be established .
if you have any questions or if you want to compile it , please contact the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the opportunity to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within these a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Reference and powerful project management .
to learn more on &amp; Po@@ sters ; and its possibilities to learn the manual is to be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , can also use a La@@ ie ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good report to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to be able to control correctly , good books e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Docum@@ ent Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 da@@ fÃ ¼ r .
just like other label languages , &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text gr@@ es are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick entry assistant to &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document .
document classes : this includes the type of document to be created : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; newsletter &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , proj@@ ectors &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding should be used ( for proper processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Article ( DIN ) , L@@ etter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) .
new users do not have to worry . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ matched ) . if you see more challenging areas of a green text on the screen , it is likely that some mathematical environment is not closed .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ start { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically a blank line ( for the input of the text ) and the corresponding row to write the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files , recovery search can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; is independent file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ort File ) &#93; ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is beside PDF the official output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when looking back , the elements of the DVI @-@ file are attached to the editor and as soon as one element in the DVI @-@ file is cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide Master document can be set to project project settings .
quick build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if there are no bugs in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be ber@@ eav@@ ed and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the rapid construction .
when viewing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection boxes should be located . the selection fields have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for the quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the Other is for items such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available possibilities are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or a different element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection box possible ) .
when using quotation , a selection list with literary inserts is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size . it is possible to specify the font boxes for the main text , marks , etc . , the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the Wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings .
par@@ enth@@ eses after the \ \ document@@ class command contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font . if the font does not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or the push of a button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; the storage will automatically execute .
if you fail to compile the document , it should be searched for errors in logging . if you use rapid build @-@ up &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font .
the changes are only checked within the area ( from \ \ } { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it can , for example , be added to certain fon@@ ts , li@@ pos@@ ure , cour@@ ses@@ sive pressure , sub@@ sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cour@@ sing pressure and is long enough until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ &apos; quota : creates a quote in the document . quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is shown , follow a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments to the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . to do this , a quote , a few places in the bold and cour@@ sing pressure , and a poem may be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI @-@ file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed using File Print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file has been created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is created , the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preference search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . to do this , you just have to set Modern under Settings box ... tools Construction can be selected .
to execute the pre @-@ selection search , the mouse poin@@ ter needs to be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on pre @-@ select search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer then takes place .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and selected to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( setting up the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
should an error occur when using the &amp; DVI ; if there is an error , this will be shown in summary in the log file or in the message window .
the log file tells the source code of the source code . in the editor , the previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and newer La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between errors . in order to view the fla@@ wed line , the error in logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; navig@@ ates to the correct line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pre @-@ set options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to create a new document . more information can be found in the section .
typical users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Settings general .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . if a simple way of creating a template is required , it should be searched for one on the Internet and are executed through the steps described below .
&amp; ates ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and raising of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; kate ; can be made directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about it and its possibilities , the hand@@ book should be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called via the menu La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed string button to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , clicking on \ \ par of \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with left mouse button , the selected text is copied automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the various types of source texts and to highlight it . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can come up with additional jump tok@@ ens . this is an own type of book@@ mark within the text . the men@@ ue modi@@ fiers , jump tok@@ ens , or the respective push @-@ button activate the jump to the next or last jump token . this is also highlighted in this jumping stamp , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offering excellent opportunities , in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex . &amp; lat@@ ex ; requires always many environments and groups and therefore support &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this enhanced meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only preventive thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the slots are separated by two empty lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this option also has an extended meaning , since this command also contains &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a back @-@ line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) should be selected at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands are included for the text of the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or inside the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , you can quickly get lost . this command will close the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands corresponding to those from edit surroundings .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the closing bracket .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the closing clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the cur@@ sed clip of an &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted group par@@ enth@@ eses you can quickly get lost . this command completes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the character is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the mark is &quot; used for two simple guiding signs . &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and applies two closing notes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double check mark may be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. german or French ) and thus German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when you are using Shift , enter + Ki@@ le ; a smart line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
complete the current line with \ \ \ \ associated with an ending line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be set up under Settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to assign the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to er@@ ect this . if this tab@@ ul@@ ator is not the part of it , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some inter@@ space for columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; kate ; already providing a good source code execution , it was added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; three different modes are built @-@ in . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings box ...
when starting a new environment by the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously deterior@@ ates the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from the selection of a command . alternatively , boun@@ cing brands can be inserted , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible using the jump brand N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ est jumping mark and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; All settings can be made to these lists . you can select different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as qui@@ z books of the general language use can be selected .
the command mode is not useful for the processing of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of the complete recovery mode will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for processing environments .
when invo@@ king the complete environment or the Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment automatically initi@@ ates and it appears \ \ begin . afterwards , the ambient loading can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button to exit .
once this is complete , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; realize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is included .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; All settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of default mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le comprehen@@ sion . as an example of a check list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processing mode is initiated over the Men@@ Ã ¼ r@@ l abbrevi@@ ation or the keyboard C@@ tr@@ l + Alt empty button , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ chers are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the complete registration for all previously written persons .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Graphi@@ cs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog provides graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and re @-@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can then be converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed together in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Cre@@ ating , creating transformation and creating views .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the additional conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed with Alt ; 4 , by means of Alt ; 4 , the DVI ; file into a PS file and be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when the command is used , a viewer is usually called after the compilation . if no embedded viewer should be used , each time a new window will open .
a new project will be added to the project &quot; New Project .... &quot; here@@ with the following information is requested for the project :
when completing the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ki@@ lep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script codes . scripts can be administered over scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be updated in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; supplied with many documents . this includes documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands are included and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very big document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible assistance , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database with all to &amp; Ki@@ le ; documents delivered and this includes a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or banners . von &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor available for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix @-@ similar systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be executed .
many thanks to those who are striving for the continuation of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use in compliance with the &amp; GNU ; license . current information on the contribut@@ ors is available in the Men@@ Ã ¼ ber &amp; Ki@@ le ; .

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my@@ pro@@ c and how superior it is . let &apos;s take it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the symbol for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the required working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folder and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time you run my _ pro@@ c .
as already said , anyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the currently opened file is inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book , simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply attached . if not , delete the cro@@ chet in the current file and select the file to be checked by another file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ format@@ ted file is well @-@ format@@ med , click the Well @-@ For@@ med review selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for Relax@@ NG review is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has an &amp; X@@ SL ; -@@ processing tool ! this is using the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then let the current file simply be selected . if not , remove the selection of current file and select the file to be processed by the other file .
specify the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the counter@@ f@@ eit in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start editing plu@@ gins using the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often , several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the provision of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and serves for clear identification .
one member can have multiple roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can select from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking for the team member from the list and push@@ es the button S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after which they are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
besides the overview of your team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that takes a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the site event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see how such ladder can be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comment@@ aries by the following :
to insert notes is simple . it can either select the note entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
comments can be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ AN@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the sub@@ project manager , role in the project .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the name : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog stretches across some pages that are treated sequ@@ enti@@ ally .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
large / lower case of tags : large / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal case @-@ sensitive , the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lower case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically added attributes . normal case @-@ sensitive , the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags : if checked , is inserted for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except simple tags .
automatically update the start and finish tag : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacing of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting different types of files . restore standard settings using the Standard button .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise known as with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be b@@ yp@@ assed ) . however , this setting is affected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is affected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has come across by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depen@@ dencies of views . it corresponds to the --@@ reset layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set into details .
in the area of mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the context of structure tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be vali@@ dated for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP where the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation is slightly different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
plu@@ gins can be managed here . plu@@ gins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third party , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ part @-@ capable application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information will be passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Read Only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied loading . only L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts typically refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is checked , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the inserted information is correct , then save the entry if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger .
currently there is only one plug @-@ in available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . normally appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed with time numbers and conditions . normally appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . normally appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , anything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally no attention has to be paid .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen Session Start the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the running according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is shown in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it started before a de@@ bug request started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to over@@ weigh@@ ted variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution continues . if there is a de@@ bug request , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script , where possible in functions and include is incor@@ rectly adjusted .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there were not the current one .
open a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many more works of Keith .
this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; helping to get better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility make &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , script languages or &amp; CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and tool@@ bars . tag folders include two file types , the tag folder and tool@@ bars . tag folders are handy , symbolic links of image kno@@ bs ( above the editing window ) , the text and statements can be inserted faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on converting .
this document describes how tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for tag . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without a risk of a writing error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and boundaries is described in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than just element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the class type . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a just element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags describing how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc . this is a just @-@ element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code for the attributes in tag editor dialog and attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a just element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in dialog box ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a just @-@ element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a just @-@ element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ;
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check takes place only when loading the Tag@@ XML file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following , an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following , an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for at@@ tain@@ able via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a list sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Ver@@ sti@@ ce 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... created . click New action to create the same dialog :
the button abbrevi@@ ation assigned to this action . with clicking on the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the det@@ a@@ ili@@ ated settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the quick start dialog or the different see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / is removed from the document name .
% p@@ id : replaces the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text will be added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can accept input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
the output of the executed application can also be diver@@ ted according to the input . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output ; error messages , to the standard output output . it can be specified what should happen to the text written to the standard output by setting the value of the output selection field :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in a given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the right tool bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use its use , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog if available so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ cs more programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edi@@ ting size others .
please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually regarded as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking on this symbol will insert a &amp; lt ; - tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags if there is any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool bar to set dialog via Settings tool bar . make sure the tool@@ bar you want is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the Start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by applying all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
after new@@ e@@ XML doesn &apos;t exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that your tool bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most not@@ orious enlargement of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory whether someone has done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we leave the first part to you , the second we will handle here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html &gt; tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and logical at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that serves to form context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts will display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements separated by sample that are supposed to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the features of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your do@@ cr@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that they are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ repository . you won &apos;t be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the lost resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
resources can be sent to friends , partners or otherwise by email . in different places there is an e @-@ mail menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , send tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scrip@@ ts tree .
resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions will be reviewed and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . to make a donation , we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , resear@@ ches &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and sign@@ aling . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a notification appears with the source of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is a simpler way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and conversion of a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
new type tag : the string that is to appear in ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d will appear
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor to be adapted with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and to be able to draw full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this differentiation concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from tool bars to actions , everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ ggles the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the multip@@ liers with information and the tool@@ bars . please check in , and for more information on these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing , relo@@ ading , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
rect@@ angles in the Editor area result in a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse poin@@ ter , help the word under the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file , when the string under the mouse poin@@ ter refers to a file .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . at present , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional serves as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . as part of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; P@@ GT ; insert into your document , then click on the icon representing the tag . now , you can paste the data for this straight @-@ added day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in different fields in a dialog .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the representation with multip@@ liers are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes , and documentation building views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done with the contex@@ tual menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , an entire website , etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands opens with reference to navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two leaders at the bottom end of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about any script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab displays all errors in the pop @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the appropriate command . the tool@@ bar &apos;s chocolate page is the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you get a tool@@ bar in an email , you can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PA@@ TH in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why development , which someone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ knit@@ ted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details see the help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; insert , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta execute ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Se@@ quit@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest record being taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ write , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ Description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
enables you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script gives error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
shows the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
starting and switching the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries pre@@ dictions or next , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are saved with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
search the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows you to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in Chapter &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . that only creates the name . actions need to be saved using the Settings ... actions . tool@@ bars will be saved using tool@@ bar tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or someone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be fresh@@ ened without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store will fail .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the tool@@ bar currently loaded . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . smart inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting using tool bar is denied if this tag contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available default schem@@ ata depends on the version ; version .
select the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes require time or create un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting a entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window .
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate ; find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which add and modify the sequences .
this should generate a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and modify . with server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to proceed differently .
if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to your discretion .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the files you want by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . in the menu tree project properties , these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree in the sub@@ window Profile or Shift @-@ F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the Project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) can be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read in more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently , only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . in this case , troubleshooting is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by cont@@ acting one &apos;s own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn event actions and add , modify or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project , choose Open Project ... from the Project Project or the project symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allow the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten in the program . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the more uncertain password on the disk store option is not eligible .
this will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server on which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easily , but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. , by simply tu@@ gging in the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted in the Project or Project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own working method .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are the best tool for custom@@ izing the tool@@ bar &apos;s tool@@ bars . the addition of tool@@ bars is added at the bottom of the Tool@@ bar section .
the tool@@ bars and symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool bar can be created , other actions such as tool bar can be executed , tool@@ bar ren@@ aming or tool@@ bar can be executed , which can be indicated which actions should be visible on this or other tool bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action edited that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings ... and set Settings actions .. set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ ps and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you set up for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . there can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . typically , special documents are made in corresponding sub@@ folders . it is a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in an appropriate way to be efficient . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
design a document structure as desired ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As a template save as a local template ....
once this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
creating binary templates is simple : copy the file into a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as pulling and dropping or inser@@ ting via the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project file , select a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can give head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically link with &amp; PHP ; shape , insert , or link with them . in addition , you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects .
template structure in sub@@ window templates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , click the template with the right mouse button to click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . this selection is bl@@ ended as soon as the attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set up , it would de@@ activate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ tree . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project , allowing for copying of content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
additionally , you can use context menu ( to show right mouse button ) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one location to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source editor when necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . using F@@ 9 , this mode is activated , this mode is already active , offset the active cur@@ sor from one window to the other , and the position in the document is maintained .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and source editor is configur@@ able via settings Qu@@ anta . after selecting V@@ PL , you can select between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation applies : a small gap for fast calcul@@ ators and a large range for slow ones .
assuming that you want to change the title of the website , tools document properties can be selected . this allows the editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this is used to reduce the manual encoding . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the contents , e.g. keywords on the column Name and Key@@ word Key@@ word 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of cur@@ sor is as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves independently . the marker works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and dropped by means of a back button or margin key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way using the tool@@ bars , as in the source editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed from any other surrounding anch@@ ors tag .
some tool@@ bars such as the Table Assistant or the Listen Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for analyzing style sheets . unlike other programs for style sheets , the search for specific elements is possible and the style template can be followed .
to compile and compile successfully , the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .

on systems with an installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can browse the arrow keys on / off through the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the commands previously executed .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to deliver composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time correc@@ ting the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes . the merge editor under the differences windows enables resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; for folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today color monitors . if you need to check the codes frequently , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if someone alters the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , you can make typing in the file by simply writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
for example , this folder can be used as folder . folder 1 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 3 @-@ o target folder
opening dialog allows for manually typing fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting an recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . opening dialog will notice your selection and show them again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences will be done with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or mer@@ ging of folders is initiated . if a file is selected for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field will be active and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this later when saving .
the setting button opens a dialog with settings . you can set options here before starting the merge / merge operation .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . in the opening dialog , you don &apos;t have to select files , you can close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would have to create two corresponding files , download them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at present , you cannot remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; just dropping text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows is optional . ) Every information line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized you can see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . this is good in the next section ( merge ) good .
in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( C / C + + , for example , white notes are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . )
the vertical line dividing the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line will be dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparison window ) also contains an info line with the wor@@ ding : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Shift &#93; when you edited the result . usually , it contains text by automatic merge , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two bench@@ marks are used , each difference at the same time must also be resolved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button into the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ) This group will then highlight the current group .
sometimes , by automatic merge or manual editing , no more line is left in the group ; then it is displayed in these lines of text &amp; lt ; no row in the queue ; this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker you might copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the results window . go carefully with this function .
note : if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled when selecting the sources , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white notes .
navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page , side , beginning , end , string beginning and string end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the default window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigate with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture In@@ ward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the mark into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . if this is checked , whatever you mark , will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copy is eliminated . however , be careful with this option because you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart back@@ feed + new@@ line feed \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the program and restored at the next start . ( menu Options - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
when you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c font are displayed . if the selected font does not support this description , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ ert . on these systems , the knob pres@@ ets pres@@ ets automatically an un@@ just color .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab@@ l@@ ator button . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line .
when this option is checked , each sel@@ ector is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copying into the cli@@ p@@ board is then om@@ itted .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white notes can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return character &apos; \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then files with different sizes may look identical in page @-@ on @-@ page comparison although they are different . if this option is checked , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is continued .
this is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need this from time to time , use better the functions Cho@@ le A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also applies to conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options are dealt with in the chapter for scanning folders and performing mer@@ ging . see for details under documentation for directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if you already have such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further securing .
changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to quit and restart , so that the change will be active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is globally adjusted via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
above the selection fields for encoding , a short note appears , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different coding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to be used to save .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn on this to supp@@ ress emphasis of changes in white characters in the text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available when comparing three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you &apos;d prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just send out the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts mer@@ ging and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart mer@@ ging , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first hand it to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be displayed , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that exactly meets your requirements .
when reading a file , it will first hand it to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processor command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command will only be used at the end of the line . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program this by themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice .
use this pre @-@ processing command for lines to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ul@@ arly expression that matches any string . the \ \ 1 in the replacing string refers to the found text in the first log @-@ pair . the \ \ U converts the found text into upper@@ case .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword generated text $ .
while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre@@ processing command for line breaks . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hits will be replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ ase / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for viewing and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the line @-@ like Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the poin@@ ter pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... make a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can simulate mer@@ ging and displays the simulated changes without really carrying out them ,
... execute selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of single files . you only need to open files on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a base . if no target folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message box about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that have been compared will be listed .
when scanning the folder is completed , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can fold up a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - click on the object or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu includes two functions All sub @-@ directories and fold up all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold all folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the comparison window is started and a comparison window appears .
the name of the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C column and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the connection clock action cannot be selected automatically .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow , and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B one file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B one file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified , and if the option Direc@@ tories is active . then , select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that later both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ afe ) is checked , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , the mer@@ ging of the folders cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging a file is processed after the other . you status column shows skill when mer@@ ging was successful , and corresponding other messages when something unexpected occurred . if mer@@ ging is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the connection actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you do not have a target folder , then the three @-@ folder mer@@ ging mode C will be used as the target , the two @-@ folder mer@@ ging will be selected as the target and will be used for synchron@@ izing A and / or B as the target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be in the target folder , also displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . they can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
choose Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without the real changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen shot ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , select start / resume directory merge again , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you eliminate the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , let &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you continue with mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been merged individually , the entries ( in the current session ) will not merge again . even if the merge was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be set to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a preceding point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links will show . this is de@@ activated in default .
when the option is turned on , the links like normal folders are treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security .
similar to the date of confidentiality of the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can , for example , be useful if the change date has been lost when copying .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected in such a way that later both folders are identical .
if there are differences , the copy of the newer file will be proposed as action instead of mer@@ ging . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because the knowledge assumes that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will also be deleted without further backup .
usually the folder mer@@ ging view persi@@ sts while mer@@ ging individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory and text window .
you can also create a single file directly , without having to start the folder mer@@ ging . once you save the result , the status will be set to empty and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder mer@@ ging .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path may be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters need to be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . there is a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder is shown . then , a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ates from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
at the moment K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts with the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , accepts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s compact ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by dra@@ gging myself into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who went this way or will go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably not notify the configure script to K@@ DE . in default install configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will first be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is not the case .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information .
the effort has been too big to date . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process large volumes of text , a different editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly cooled ; no sr@@ c is l@@ apped ; and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
for a list of recent changes , see ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the Qu@@ ell package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . should there be any difficulties , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of them .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift Rem@@ ove ) to the cli@@ p@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift In@@ sert ) paste the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marking .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore also not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you have to update the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
there are only entries that show differences . this also results in the fact that identical files are not copied to the target folder when mer@@ ging . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button again .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual working surfaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , stop them or shift them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual working areas as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a work surface and on other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and exit . if however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , on desktop and exit . the commands cause the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
when this field is checked , the names of the virtual working areas are displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of the virtual working surfaces . if it is crossed along with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ;
when this field is checked , the current programs will be displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty work@@ spaces will be displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classical allows &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2 x N ra@@ ster , as from p@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers , horizont@@ ally displays all virtual working surfaces in a horizontal row , which is very good for viewing later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as icons or with its contents . moreover , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select Set@@ ters to set up the dialog box ... makes the dialog box appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you need to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign it to this value . possible values are :

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read a lou@@ pe for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual disability . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on powerful computers .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged section of the screen . below , this window is called magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged section of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mo@@ ve@@ able lou@@ pe . alternatively , you &amp; K@@ mag ; this causes a selected screen area to be displayed in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter on the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the settings mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not yet able to detect the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; button or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window will stand firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
start or stop updating the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , open a new window , print , relo@@ ad ( with the document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , pop@@ up and sh@@ red@@ der &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to do this , you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual disability .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse cur@@ sor is waiting for a while in the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and which each mouse @-@ click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse cur@@ sor is waiting for a while in the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click em@@ ulate pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , even by simply moving the mouse , pain can also be caused . if you suffer from pain associated with your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it clear : even though &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by mouse clicks , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it &apos;s simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click once you break the motion briefly .
if the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after having em@@ ulated the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can drag the drag on pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must reach after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; execute a mouse click .
if Intelli@@ gent@@ es Move is enabled , the shooting time is switched off ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before the mouse button is released again , if no moving of the mouse takes place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking on the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce the response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slider sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically .
if you have already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last button is pressed .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you have adjusted to the automatic mouse click , you can later remove the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to decrease in sounds .
first of all , you should make yourself aware of the position of a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window that does not link , does not lead to unwanted reactions .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you own a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . however , you can park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . this allows accidental moving of mouse clicks without causing unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to select text to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and to re @-@ insert it or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and pressing the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is displayed every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . thus , you know exactly when when moving the move time . later , you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; c@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor is short . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and those who have pain in the mouth of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that there is a certain time waiting for a drag process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can be performed with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to talk to their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can select from a list with the conversation history sets that are to be talked again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text passages you can select frequently used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can compare the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are added to the word supplement .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a running memory of the already spoken pro@@ positions ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
if you have played k@@ mouth correctly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the outlet memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again .
with the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry , set up the dialog box from &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog provides two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , page word completion , and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the voice output voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding to pass the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as parameters . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passages book or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of Instant Talk the selected text passage is spoken directly and added to the default memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector of the editing window for text passages , you can determine whether the text entry book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text pass@@ book book will not be saved . select Before saving , become &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book @-@ book should be saved .
in the main window in addition to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth shows a selection field if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can choose the dictionary currently used as a word supplement .
with buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages text@@ books or text passages by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the directory cache .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the directory cache .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the processor .
if this menu item is crossed , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons is displayed for frequently used commands . by default , the tool bar is placed directly under the menu bar above the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling , the tool bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text passages is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar above the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
you probably haven &apos;t entered the command for the voice output correctly or not fully . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and specify the command for voice output on the voice output voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ izer for further details . )
the festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ o are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line to set up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ etts folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows you to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax gladly swal@@ lows the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :

the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the voice generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears on &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , print text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always re@@ write .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not contain a speech synthes@@ izer . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; t@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows each application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities .
read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor ; , even if , in other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications embedded .
speech output takes place via the speech dispens@@ er program , which uses various background programs like es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the generation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( SM@@ ML ) .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ ch@@ iling list . subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ dir .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , you need to install program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher and adjust correctly . see also
at the first start of t@@ t@@ m@@ gr or as long as there are no speakers set up , the card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card gener@@ ein is displayed . see .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . they can also set up multiple variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed stop@@ pers otherwise use the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the Car@@ pa@@ thi@@ cker Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card speaker is displayed . it will automatically appear automatically when you start t@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the top speakers will appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select here a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the spokesperson on the card . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use . go back to the General tab and check whether voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the card orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the tab General to open this card . here you can set up some general options .
check this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will hold K@@ TT@@ SD and remove the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disable .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , it runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear when reading in the control bar system area , it will disappear as soon as the reading is complete .
with buttons in this series , you can start , pause , stop and record text orders .
with buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board pre @-@ read or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and tick there language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text that should be read and select the text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; out ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read and select the text in the main menu . then the speech output should start .
this also works if &amp; when ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de message system ; that informs you about events that you have identified . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different kinds of messages . for example , you can set up a message when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supported a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent to K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is edited before being sent to the speech dispens@@ er program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and spokesperson or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the operation of filters , it is important to know how the &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be continued .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning takes preced@@ ence and holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
news is the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text assignments . every job you hit from the card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text assignments . tex@@ tual assignments are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; t@@ ts ; just one such preview , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters .
strings replacing parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; t@@ ts ; is supplied with pre @-@ defined string replacement filters , which enable the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ ulation of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Converter use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format .
with voice selection filters , you can send orders to a spokesperson depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the Kar@@ tei@@ Map spokesperson , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is used for a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue to change the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were set on the page below . editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from the top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and you will see the following setup di@@ alogs below .
for setting character set filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison sample . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text .
specify a name for your filter . you can select this name arbitr@@ arily , it must differ only from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column replace .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list of a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter will only be applied when the speaker speaks one of the languages registered here for the text order . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you will have to leave the application ID of running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if you indicate the application ID @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copied .
the string release filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if it is equal . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string release filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited on both sides by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can use it in the di@@ alo@@ gues Add or Edit as help to assemble these expressions .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ forms translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available through the PA@@ TH environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c suff@@ ices .
the speaker selection filter allows you to send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card or@@ ator , or to a speaker with certain features . for example , you can specify that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; t@@ ts ; a text to the filter passes , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker features that the program sends to the speaker , and the properties of the speaker set up on the card &apos;s spokesperson . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help at entering .
in order to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to meet the required requirements . click on the button to see the dialog box selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the Language Edition API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the Language Edition API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found at the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bilit@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice delivery services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program t@@ t@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text to read and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type :
open two &amp; console ; window . start t@@ d in a window , then t@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; forming filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read .
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) Voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so S@@ able works at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the PA@@ TH environment variable .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ b @-@ cat@@ fish is emit@@ ted . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the respective language . if there are problems with specific characters or words , they may be corrected by a string release filter . see .

the language synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can download it in the kt@@ ts@@ d . additionally , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ ached under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the website ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza .
K@@ T@@ TS also works with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages at rate . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information , which are not yet included in this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile &amp; execute , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs packages and the development files for the &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; downloaded from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ fer or downloaded the tar@@ ball that has been created every night , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , first check whether speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; t@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which uses the speech dispens@@ er program . the t@@ ms@@ gr utility should be developed so that the configuration of speech dis@@ pat@@ chers is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can return set or paragraph style , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about it , like &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , you will see in .
if you click Add a spokesperson on the Add @-@ on button , and in order to insert a speaker into the list , or click Edit , the Kar@@ tei@@ Map Spe@@ aker Setup will be displayed . for example , below is the setup of the module for Festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found below .
specify the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PA@@ TH , you just have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that will be passed to the festival . in terms of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting is performed automatically . in general , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 applies , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some of the controls and display this grey , the voice chosen by you does not allow these settings .
some voices such as Multi@@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forgot to click Apply ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed on the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol t@@ m@@ gr will be visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is checked and t@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders in the queue are listed , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the currently processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column ID on the card or@@ ator .
with buttons in this row , you can advance or return on the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system segment . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and administr@@ ated . expenses of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information about the types of news from &amp; kt@@ ts , see .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module , can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaker speed here . 50@@ ml ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ ml ; % about double normal speech speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA equipment includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will have to find out which device works with you . in case of doubt , choose Standard .
on this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; t@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . once the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; still welcome someone who enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text assignments . for messages , warnings and the expenditure of screen readers there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to be able to read K@@ not@@ fy messages , start t@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card card noti@@ fications will appear .
select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fy Noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are not read by &amp; without .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event occurs . you have the following selection options :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter the features of the speaker you want . default select the speaker that is displayed in the list on the Kar@@ tei@@ Map Spe@@ aker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as a final option , the action will be used to carry the action specified under Standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the warning noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . use the store button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all Noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to select text for voice output . this standard contains stamps for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ml is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) since this is the default voice , the festival uses the output of SS@@ ml .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ ml ; % , the SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ?

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limit detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can start reading text into individual sentences . this allows &amp; t@@ ts to start faster with the pre @-@ reading , since only the first set must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . this allows you to skip or pause jobs on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not directly support this .
at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit detection filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add further set @-@ limit identi@@ fier filters , but beginners are advised .
the easiest way to get to know the setup of the speaker selection by trying out . switch on the speaker selection and select text to read . switch on the subscri@@ ber selection , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changes . you have to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; t@@ ts ; then faster to start reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time ,
you can order or cancel text orders on the card card orders , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limit recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set limit detection filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the panel of subscri@@ ber units , you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . the card is displayed if

use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the subscri@@ ber &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ t ; the speaker that most likely corresponds to the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the characteristics of the speaker you want . if this property does not play a role , don &apos;t give anything .
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a primary property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is present if you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker button and then use the speaker that is most likely to follow the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .

festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you must install at least one language . find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read pages , you need to install the ( male British ) Voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to limitations in passing on .

if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; this produces the audio output . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates this from &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be produced from German text di@@ phone .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Voice files are not installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and the setting of network features enabled .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed for installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and the release date . by checking the setting No @-@ again questions the definition can be permanently hit .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are gray displayed , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the Network Interface Panel is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the rider network interfaces :
the settings displayed on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... to set up in the dialogue device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options .
with the selection Automati@@ cally the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are done at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the option Manual , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration can be performed . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field Network mask , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be checked .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching off an out@@ dated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
speci@@ fies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host is calling ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator part of the name resolution allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . entries can be placed in the list by selecting a entry or down@@ gra@@ ding or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Hin@@ auf or Her@@ unter .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be added to the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . it will display the Edit dialog .
the list name known calcul@@ ator describes host @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , DNS servers can replace it .
normally , the list of publicly known computers contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still in test version of IP is intended to replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has multiple alias names , press the Add button repeatedly and enter the additional alias name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select an entry of an especially known computer from the list and select Edit .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; console .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installing the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface can be used like k@@ package or the installation tool for your distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files are discussed .
this area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely used . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be deployed in the near future .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; off ; work@@ station is the network administrator to use a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a particular area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
smaller networks usually use addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = one &apos;s own machine ) . the default route is needed for IP transfer .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 has its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content found there in the event of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand than expected can happen .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first consisted of creating a surface for tar which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing .
before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat . this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; pul@@ ls the tape back and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ er on the tape does not , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ sp@@ ann , searches for the right index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the Status Bar an appropriate message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ apping the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates by changing the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat . if your tape drive assumes that a tape can be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you are format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat , continuing with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you run the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be backed by this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
mark files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup is started , the dialog box opens up for backup . in this dialog , you can review the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the backup dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the drive entry . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the check@@ out process is started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can review your selection and change the working folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for the check , the dialog appears to check . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process , as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore from the Rest@@ ore menu ....
once the recovery process is started , the dialog for Recovery will appear . in this dialog , you can review your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the recovery settings , the dialog will restore . this dialog displays the progression of the recovery process , as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the tape inde@@ x@@ file on the basis of the belt content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ write the index in two ways :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup is to take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the newly selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are backed up like the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be placed separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent from the others .
to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a sn@@ apshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file that has been used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the sn@@ apshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new sn@@ apshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding option of the belt device .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is involved , the command l@@ ends load to the drive . on some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the outlet in the tape drive . possibly this setting will not work with all band drives .
if the option is enabled , the tape is automatically ki@@ cked off . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat . not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case report the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat , a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is a host@@ name : seconds , with host@@ name the complete name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time in which the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that run directly with &amp; GNU ; tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it does not deal with incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to receive information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information about issues that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features , with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log@@ files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available , with whose help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be filtered easily and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; initially the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open . it will not appear to you , and it will open instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for which normal user usually does not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or set of strings . the list of the log @-@ lines is now automatically changed , so that only log @-@ lines will be displayed that match the selected filter . in the default setting , a protocol line will be displayed only if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can , of course , select another entry at this point . for example , the string of the filter search term will be matched only with entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol select the column process , and add the name of a process in the filter bar , so you will show &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspic@@ uous color as protocol lines of the step note . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog .
if you only want to show specific processes ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron Protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the option to skip to new lines in the main window &apos;s context menu , to display all new protocol lines added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying several protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you can find more up @-@ to @-@ date information on the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program start @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I won &apos;t go into historical aspects here ( for example because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to system V In@@ it without installing a new installation and re@@ format . so you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service that you want to start when you start the system or change to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are r@@ c.@@ local .
you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one it finds .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably note that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can manually edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you come to repair it by re@@ starting the system and run :
but how do all the correct scripts start ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user running level , which &amp; eg ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will only be removed from its initial run@@ level ( or position ) . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the field of available system services .
note : entries will be moved if you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the sor@@ rows of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service .
note : at present there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work areas ( Avail@@ able System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the input key to open the Properties dialog . use the tab@@ ul@@ ator button to change the properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of loss of data , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly re@@ starting . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v , intended for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not conform to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available from the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply quit without a message when their configuration files are not available or set up incor@@ rectly .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual may be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation of &amp; k@@ user .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either you can use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with double @-@ click on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled user settings ( quota ) for users , a card will be created on which you can make individual adjustments . additional flash@@ cards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix .
the card password management appears if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Unix .
this card only appears if the quota for at least one built @-@ in fil@@ esystem is activated and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable to the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the space limitations in KB are :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the field fil@@ esystem with space limitation .
the Groups tab informs about the group members of the selected user . the standard group , which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add to the User or Group menu , or click the matching Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user / group works alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change boot password , change time to boot from the standard operating system , add , remove , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify , modify and modify the boot password .
