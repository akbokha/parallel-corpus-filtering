<seg id="1">Translate the module website in & konqueror; to translate the menu under Extras website. select the source and target language of the translation from the list below.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part of the whole & URL will be translated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. Babylonfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions depending on the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated into the Babelfish website, where you can paste texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror by making them easier to use.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on how to use & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Add settings.... Open the toolbox Tools and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list with default settings modules from the box kde; addons. please note that any more modules on your system are if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror, before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">In order to use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page that has & konqueror; crash, or delete the list of crashes, if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module View filter (also called OrdnerFilter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Anviews filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's up-to-date working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM on the currently displayed website. as default, the display starts with the root tip of the document, example: documentelement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME content inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView; consists of displaying nested hierarchies by means of a so-called Tree map. tree-Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportionally to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size is the size of a file or folder, and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. in this way, large files, even then easily recognized, can be easily identified when they are far down in the folder hierarchy.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either display depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the image of another file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for displaying, or whether the area of subordinate rectangles may occur (and consequently, the relative position of the label in the rectangle) can be set.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemaps the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always observed. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of the entries, and this frame will need space, which is then lost to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the surface of an entry for the sub-entries is done, the implementation remains up to date. hereby, it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoidance of space losses due to always advantageous the areas so splitting that rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimally displayed area for an entry on the menu entry View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widget designed for the application of KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image gallery can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the image gallery, a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the" "" "Title" "" "option allows you to adjust the title of the gallery page in a text input field." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a turn field to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">To display the filename of the image, specify whether the file names under the thumbnails will be displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">To view the file size of the image, specify whether the file size is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, you indicate whether the size of the images is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder you specify where the gallery will be stored and which sub-folders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the File Selection in HTML file, enter where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the subfolder check box, you can set up the subfolder with a slider or a turn field, until which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original images with the check box to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the commentary box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth you can set a different color depth for thumbnail images than in original images.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings gives you easy access to general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; display menu under the Navigation Area window or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror, adding browser and operating system recognition for single domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of & konqueror is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses access to this browser, change browser detection to one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that refuse to access browsers based on Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser detection to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not comply with the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the set browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the amount of information about the browser and operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -Module check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; -documents in accordance with W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">Check the module website in & konqueror; check the menu under Extras website. you can make the following tests:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; -Check test if your & HTML; -document of the syntax of & HTML; corresponds to all found errors are displayed. with this test you can make sure that your pages are correctly represented by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to review your & CSS; style sheets embedded in an & HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid & CSS; your web pages have a uniform look regardless of the browser you are using.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and get your photos directly in & digicam; albums can be downloaded. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, every media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& nbsp; contains a fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use these to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can easily be expanded with KDE Image Plug-in Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & edited; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion via libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or the lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & edited; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. you should therefore report problems and improvement options.</seg>
<seg id="60">& edited; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu provides a page in the error reporting system. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system. all necessary information is already entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& nbsp; is a project supported by a community. i.e., the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user from & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions of other users. in this mailing list however English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage to get news about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best way to get involved in & digicam; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & edit; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & edited; will you additionally use as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains pictures, as base folder. & edited; view each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& nbsp; During recursively the library path in its entire depth. you can't exclude subfolders unless it is iste in hidden folders. this can be done by unpasting out one point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change it by taking any photo from the album and discarding it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & edit your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Favorites to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">The support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu help shell support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh Decoderets and Roh sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and get your photos directly in & digicam; albums can be downloaded. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, every media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transmission to the computer the camera is often used as a disk drive. the camera can also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicam; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions over the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & edited; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support in order to read the preview images from digicam. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to do about & digicam; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plug-In Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digicam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier to add & edit; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes were in & edited;</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; remove or change in full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the Albentree, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to select the most common files: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the filename only works when this is displayed in the symbol view. what fields can be displayed can be configured in the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos taken by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were recorded on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the legacy properties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Album Import images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select Album Import screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it. in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album features, you must right-click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a way to select your albums so that you can be grouped by a common name. the collection you set will be used to sort your photos if you choose to sort or delete albums from the collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used if you sort your albums by date with view albums. sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">Buttons Elders, Average, New Year: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last change of each file will be used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first opened an album in & quot; open, the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select the Album button. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& nbsp; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keywords list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all the photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images are displayed in this album in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lupin buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album the first time, you need to wait a short while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by recreating all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image is displayed below the previewed preview. what information is available can be edited by editing settings; set up the albums page and adjust the range preview images to your preferences.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help buttons, which appear. if you let the mouse pointer rest for a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the section introduction to the main window displays such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Pictures and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. the image processing shows your photos and allows you to accomplish a number of improvements to them. you can access all the features with & digicam; you have the choice between viewing the pictures, a slide show or the editing of the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 Image Edit... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit... Select. in the editing section, you will find a guide how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">You can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. to do so, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, you may encounter problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data with you when you save the modified image. this information is lost from EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& nbsp; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotate. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc.).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digi.Delete, it is moved into the trash bin of & kde; shifted. F8 Picture Delete or Del If you prefer to really delete it, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Datumslistequot; organizes your photos using the data. & edited; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture-view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view, so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword features a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or searching.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all the photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keywords; so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My Recipitsquot; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the substituting of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and discard it. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, select the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To use & digitization; s functionality with keywords, you first need to put your photos with keywords. this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want with a keyword, you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My Applicants. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and assign keywords from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu. the menu will show you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, you just need to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame that displays the time unit. this displays all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the box below, you can enter a title and save your selections. this will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">If you click here the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again. if the search did not find anything, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider on the left side bar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search will be performed. the result will be displayed in my search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching again, just select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select to edit the search, the form will appear again with the search information entered. if you select as an advanced search, the dialog for the advanced search appears to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Search in the Search context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digi.s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a query query in the Albendatabase. any option can be added or deleted using the search group / search group. each option can be linked to other via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or at least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& nbsp; characterized every picture by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar. by using a swellerts, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you push a picture from somewhere over the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand paint scheme: draw a quick sketch and & digicam; find the matching images. here too, a threshold can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can move it in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it. move it while you move the left mouse button to pull a square. all images within these coordinates will be filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the below field you can specify a name for your Geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& nbsp; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L To add the light table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the light table and its window opened. if you are back in & digi.Main Window, you can quickly open the light table with L Extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the thumbnail you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right side of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you have a preview syncing from the toolbar and perform zooming or sliding operations on one of the images, then they will be compared with the other image. you can thus compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you use pairing mode from the toolbar, then the two first pictures will automatically be loaded into the areas for comparison. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to view it in the right panel. this simplifies to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal soldering actions also work directly from the lighting table, such as F4 file...</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to swing the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB. in the Preview mode, both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. simply use the Zoom knob under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zooming out. this happens in both pictures when you are previewing in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - aside from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the picture has been taken to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos scans, scans or stores digital photos leads through a form of digital stock management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up your images, find, protect and use photos. we will focus on the process for digital photographers which & edited; we view the download, rename, remove, convert, group, backup, review, sample, archive, optimise, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes on, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, assembles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data via data. in accordance with your definition, metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you don't even know how many photos you have, then use not & edit;. the approach to store metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do is the structure of information structure as opposed to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. note that you need to switch to a larger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for that content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new ones from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to save metadata in the settings page of the metadata in & digi.This ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? in addition, it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now assign keywords, labels and a rating to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's read with keywords, keywords, as you often call other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digicam; automatically build the tree for you and insert the pictures in the right place. modifying the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by moving a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very crude representation because each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to share your photos with anyone, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I'll tell you this of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming, to have associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. so your perception has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others looking at your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicam; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as caption. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels will be exported to your liking in the label and / or the title of the web-gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find in another city without a navigation system? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train of spatial presentation continues with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit geolocation are innumerable and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels via pictures with geographical data. & edited; can also export kml files that you can open with GoogleEarth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and designates the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms apply also in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digicam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should include your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to add the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author's line): linked to the author. this field contains the work description of the photographer. examples of this can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a mark to the author field, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for vendors): use the provider field to identify who works the photo. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright paragraphs, although they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this data embedded in the picture. for private persons, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & edited; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate defects, plate failure, electrical impulses, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, desaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the road or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, it concerns problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be handled cautious and you can no longer trust you than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers on gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can become unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recorders are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so it's about choosing the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just written. that's why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a cheap program called IsoBuster which seems to cause miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to win the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Do not forget to copy the media with a description, date & author and then store them on a clean, dark dry and protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturer's guarantees include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives:</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the Controllers are the most common cause of error. SMART is the most common error cause, SMART cannot detect this error. some of SMART's errors in particular are terminating the imminent failure. these are particularly read errors and displacement meters. the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data due to a power failure before you have saved the files, but these losses can usually be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical appliances do not make a lot of power, this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high speed processes. these anomalies can cause severe damage. thus, these anomalies can cause severe keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from the unavoidable loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against spikes is a surge protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grooves the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. remember, however, that not each connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage can use any cable to your computer, you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protectors which also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a large number of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in case of a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide cordless power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and shut down the system. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of current problems with the cost of avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected. finally, you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can install it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">Compared to the hard drives at home, however, you are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures available in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the large companies in the offer a backup and a distributed memory. thus, they are desaster safe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all of these disorders remain undetected until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. nobody seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. you will see thousands of mistakes a year already in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license compatible with the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protective mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; but it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the loss of data in the notebook and 46% of the workstation systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lower damage, e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the widest file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology continues to develop, there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is likely to deteriorate. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so secure your data often after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous such as reinstalling your operating system, replacing plates or resizing hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a bolt strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. don't forget aircraft disasters: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a frequent reason for a loss of data despite backup is the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last full backup. generates a complete snapshot at two times: that of the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. create multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made. this backup comes closest to a versioning system closest to the exception that is only scanned and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference between files that have actually been changed.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end, you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file, retain information, associated XMP files, original retain, storage, scalability, media, rediscover images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable images to survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you must consider all that is said today with caution and reevaluate while time passes. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available to everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have scaled the scalability and set the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux, you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg to see if your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdb, the new disk is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of the tire if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if there is no software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been designed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color allocation for heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras, you can save your images in this format. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open-screen image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block & quot; XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP adapts because it saves the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as indicated above, the raw format is old. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a multi-layered editing you can use external programs. if you re-edit the images with & edited, then you should add the metadata again. these were under certain circumstances cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them to web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digi.In the addition of a photo to an album you will find a description how to add photos you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; use it, connect it to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is established, a feral indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application of any file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry and its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information that is stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, Manufacturer's Note, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as with the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam;. while downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired with the default selection methods of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the button selected is digested until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New Download is available. these images have not been downloaded from & digi.In this case the new pictures are marked with a star in preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the buttons all or you want to download selected files, a dialog appears where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you chose the target album, press OK, and & edited; load the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the Delete All button. if you want to delete only a few, you need to select them first and then delete the selected deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded in a & digi; -album before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera, you should do this via the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often use no meaningful names for the photos as filenames. the file names are normally recycled after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names if you load photos of various recording destinations into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the picture was taken into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based subalbums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created per day automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two affect the data about the author in the standard Autoridentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the default format, e.g. in the editing field, you can use the prefix photo-% Y-%% H% H:% M:% S.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the option of camera filenames, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or in capital letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digicam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you next time open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& nbsp; can use all information on orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera does not supply this information, & digicam; the photo in original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken, you can automatically create subalbums in the target album. all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar Meta data, you can check what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in this case it will save & edit; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you must turn this option on. use the Advanced button and select the date-based subalbums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is completed, you ask & digicam; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder chooser dialog appears for the camera. select the folder you want and press OK to start uploading. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position specified in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the data can be identified by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environment planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicam; users want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailings and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via a post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical allocation (manual) and most recently about manually entering known locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save these data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geographical assignment module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and from GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the characters with hairy co-ordinates, such as maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& nbsp; It tries to give you so much control over its operations as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to set up in the Settings menu; select Setting. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing. you stack the default behavior of & digikam; note if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">This field should be a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations should be registered here since this is the picture other & quot; anbietenquot;. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC field. this will ensure that metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the data base; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image labels as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the labels embedded in the images. this allows your captions to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; edited; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digiplug; try, you can add and remove the file extensions from this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Refresh to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the light by & digicam; can be set on this page to the default values. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; loadenquot; you should only use on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar when you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma subsampling means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">Using PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality, since PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF Comcompress, you can turn the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality, since the Deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the resolution lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph is written, metadata has not been supported yet, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digikam, image editing was just one image viewer for photos. currently, it quickly becomes a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">If you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option records the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the spotlights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top lights, so the parts of your images that are burned out due to the inability of your camera to capture the top lights in the settings. the setting colors trigger some unusual results as it shows the top lights in various robes.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option of reconstructing, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digicam; image processing. to keep the time for the demo icing, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data, which come from the color-filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix color pixel. this algorithm is also known as a CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. VNG-Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can put the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softening correction as it is performed during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information such as the color information of a color space in the other is translated to allow the colors to be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile Folders You can set the folder here, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all of your profiles. & edited; examine this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when opening the shell file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures do not manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some such as Canon, which contain no color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma does not correct conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the color mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your picture would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated. this could manually correct you instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface, & digikam; many modules support that are written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these are then downloaded from & digi.These modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of slide show should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn the metadata into one or out, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties appear on the left side a list of all supported cameras. on the right side there is a button Automatic Detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If you don't, you can set camera model and port manually. once you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the menu Cameras by the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can paste it all here.</seg>

<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be tacitly accepted by & digi.If you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without any queries. otherwise, you will need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen of & digicam; disable when starting. this will expedite the start-up of & edit;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting Beim Start after new photos is forcing & digitizing; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam; if something from the base folder was deleted, query & digikam; you, if it is to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & edited, to adjust the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar under Settings Design. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digicam; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& nbsp; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the item ad / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digi.You may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the section image editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, displaying file name, current file number, magnifying factor and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should then make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by reproducing from the File menu or use the button Restore the Image Processing Restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of image editing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting Editing undo or restoring by selecting Editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make use of the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo and recognize Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB, press a moment longer via the undo or restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the size of the window, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enmagnification factor Automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you enter the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, the toolbar is displayed. if you do not want this, you can change it in the settings dialog by & digikam; main window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the picture in the File menu and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single pictures or whole sentences. you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select print coach from the Album Export menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digicam; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation arrows, even in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear into the edge again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. the text is UTF-8 compatible, which means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF and IPTC- fields so you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated to 2000 characters and special characters are reshaped. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, either use the user button or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the user button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The Evaluation section displays a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The valuation is written in the IPTC field of Urgency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords, the Keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used before; -session applied verbs.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can easily restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword (IPTC).</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keywords, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please read the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword filtering sidebar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, date, keywords and searches. if in addition one or more keywords are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop keywords. in the main view, you have selected several images to provide you with keywords. if the keyword exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the Keyword filter refers to No keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword has been drawn from the right sample tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be disabled under Settings Different.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or its, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry according to which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly made it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resemble those from your camera or scanner and that the colours you print or publish in the web that are of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the subject comes to color management, everybody wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow fulfills all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (more information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image output is e-mail or web, where sRGB is de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so simple, why should one use a different color space and thus have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent page and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to turn my monitor when I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you have to sound your monitor because sRGB is emitting your monitor. if you are working as a sRGB colour space, you must either turn your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting to manually edit.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, balance, Automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Correcting Automatic correction attempt automatically to make the best of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaling the Leuststärling values over the entire image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest spot becomes as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method converts the intensity factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. it sometimes produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic scanning: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Enlarge Contrast: this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a replenishment of all values in between. this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">If you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side both the original image and preview of the target image can be seen. the preview will dynamically change the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the upper right there is a histogram that is dynamically changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your total is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values will also be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the Preferences list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in white balance. this is displayed in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and Load are doing exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved in a text file and reload it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will give another photo than your original. if you save these settings your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time, and stands only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialog as editing raw images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. colour mapping can be performed by the subwindow for brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the color management chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under color tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and also allows you to save your settings so that you can always use them for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same error and therefore always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the gradation tool that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tools color effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar control effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created by exploiting a partially developed print from the additional light. this had the effect that the brighter areas were darkened and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the polarization. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further upliftment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar efficiency effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for natural photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. for large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and luminance of the photos. you can click to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you do a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too great saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform can be previewed. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tools Gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / Gamma the tool is set to improve the exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complex, you only need the area of the slider for the application purpose described here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three slider are clicked into and shifted to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn to operate is to shift the controller and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand side, the original and previewing of the picture can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left hand, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed using linear or logarithmic y-axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear narrative is often the most useful. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. the compression of the output values can, for example, be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and reloaded later. to do this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. check the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to place the entries of the Histogram for Rot-, Green, Blue and Luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modify channel: this box allows the channel to be specified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond with darker tones and that the corresponding image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">Preview the original photos is a red marker to see. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and solar tones. check the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curves.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & edited channel mixer; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel blender for image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">The channel selection box allows you to select the colour for the histogram: this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with one's rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for Red, Green and Building allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will retain the general brightness even if you change the appropriate color components. this is particularly convenient if you also activate the Monochrome option because the channel blender then is THE tool for creating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colored. colored is made of small noise-files that do not occur at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color noise first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender setting can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been newly adjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image is shown below (1) and the modified image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Superb</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lentil filter. this looks good, with all the scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. thus, similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moon light scenes at daytime. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepithelia: generates warm bright and medium tones while adding a bit cold in the shaded tones. this is very similar to the process of bleaching a pressure and the redevelopment in a squamatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) scepiphilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digicam; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, stitching an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicam; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep your attention is to set the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. in the picture frame, the module can be started from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your picture. outline the picture with a colored line, Niepce outline it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), botched it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a buttoneffect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: determines the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio previously used.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any location. this also goes to multiple places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from color space and character set with its properties as you need it. the bigger the picture, the bigger the character set must be. finally, simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you choose for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicam; apply tool stencil, you can lay a template over an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The image template menu apply in image editing can be used to lay templates over an image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For templates there are no limitations concerning the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button basic folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings are marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the template's thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="474">There are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button reduces the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitization; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is perhaps the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitization process colors need to be summarized with only minimal differences to one color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, a camera is often used for internal sharpness. in contrast, images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpness filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening value. you can call this with the menu entry Dogs.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should handle this carefully because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the edge of the edges, but also strengthens the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image is refocusing. you can refocus more information and compare all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool to soften softly with the menu entry Correcise softeners and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount enhances the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, roughness and the impression of grates will create close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius determines how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference-amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharper and therefore beauty flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blunt masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the modified image the (2). blur mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicam; tool refocusing refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected removal filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocusing usually reaches better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß 's folding. the Gauß' s folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result from the source pixies far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß 's folding is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the remote pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular focus: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will further mitigate the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's edge: this is the radius for the Gauss edge. use this parameter if your blur is gauze. in most cases, you should let this value 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauze's edge. however, note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, colour and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible, but which later left uncomfortable artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp Maskieren produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp mask use a bigger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter one can show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically, the result of the FIR Vienna Film is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the field correction methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">"" "the" "" "smoothing" "" "regulator sets the blur of the area of the darkened area to create a more natural pupil." ""</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a modified colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most widely developed tools to remove undesired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail preservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the image. whereas larger values are mainly homogeneous regions smoothing and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no sharpening is necessary retrospectively.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film grain or a CCD diamond will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to match the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures. the higher this value, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it has to be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is traversed. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient here.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-increment da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by choosing this option is minimal. however, it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to leave it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">"" "the" "" "Save as and Load" "" "buttons do exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and reloaded later." ""</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with little artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City by an analog camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artefact in the background that caused by a bad film shift during the trip. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise noise. it uses a proprietary copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindows details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters per pixel need and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness. this value sets the pixel distance to the front to detect luminescence changes. if it is increased, noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and roughness or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the whole noise cannot be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak hash or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically bolted more strongly. however, it also smears the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phase adjustment. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter may occur at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to soften softly with the menu entry Correcise softeners and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's hiss, film granults, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or retrospectively digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it creates some compression & quot; arteftsquot; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed image. this setting is intended to correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious filming on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digicam; tool Hotpixel makes it possible to remove Hotpixel from photos taken with a CCD camera gem, eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw-mode photographs because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard with the darkimage button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the darkpicture directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate darkimage to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all the preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in the middle and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area. instead, vignettieri quot; (shadowing) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reaching the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also use a center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise the sharpest effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's felt and color depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using an equivalent transformation on a rough image that was done without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three more exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density the filter. the standard density is 2,0, which is equivalent to an optical filter with a lens setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignette, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image using the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjusting of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image processing from the color gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignette correction to be applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminous and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grades covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect, but flaws at the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of engraved edge corrects the removed corners opposite the second gradient. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value checks the strength of the distortion second grade. with negative values, tonal distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value checks the strength of the distortion fourth degree. this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'corners' parameters have the reverse sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resumes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction. the values you use for your picture are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The clay or kissing-shaped correction should be performed before any cutting or resizing changes. best perform this correction as the first. if you cut a picture new and then perform a tonical correction, the effect would be apparent.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best corrections, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal aid line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to fix the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea border or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you rectify a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the Edit menu, Cut crop out of image processing or zoom regulators of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motives, such as pictures from the front, frame and paintings it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the image have 90 degrees. please note that if you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the GimpGuru.org website that is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below previewing you can set two parameters setting film baskets and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the merge movie granulator option if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller changes the amount of film baskets and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the modified image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digicam; Filter Filters is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granults on your pictures. this is known by classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver particles of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to postpone back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, streetphotographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO 2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-grading effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the film sensitivity used corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicam; filter oil paintings create the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicam; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures. smoothing controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processor is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothes 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicam; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal ore. the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pen size and the bottom adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicam; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digicam; Filter engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondary landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the modified image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Waves 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using the imblur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom: sharpens the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from one central point. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurs the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance-sharpness: wipes the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: wipes the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blurring: blurs the image soft into the dark and strongly in the light tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking: blurs the image through random shifting of pixels and thus simulates the sharpness of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart forsharpness: find the color pool in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">Raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses a proprietary algorithm protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow along with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digicam; image processing will keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the modified image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning in the right direction. the tools for this can be found in the menu Transformating Turning or Transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo magnifier is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approach the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is checked, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it has to be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons Save as and Load are used precisely for this purpose. each stamping for photo magnification can be saved as a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Blowing photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo magnification by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to assemble a picture. to cut a photo, simply use the mouse to create just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and moving the rectangle. you'll see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be overlapping by drawing at the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply holding the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the Ctrl; + X button to cut image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or File Save File menu in the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inches, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio knob set the area for cutting to the widest possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">Cutting the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly help enable you to blend aids so that you can better assemble your pictures. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonious triangles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a way to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonic triangles aligned on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spirals of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The gold center provides fluid relief lines if you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads to the viewer's look along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual river on this type.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye is at the center of the composition.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the gold spiral discussed above. their vertices are the middle points of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal to place these lines can be made a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break up your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal options mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the colour of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can become invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the & digicam; image editing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform the free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair this is to use the function Transformer cutting from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the Automatically Cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed at a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information which help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left at the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image gets a little blurred. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. a way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The scoring tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal pattern, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shoot your image by using horizontal and vertical angles. if you click presets, the angles will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the scoring tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the scaling, the picture gets caught a little bit. for a single loop this effect is mostly negligible, but two lines generating twice as much confusion and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After scaling the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& Editing; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, compiled from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digicam;</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraphviz; is a KDE program used to view & graphviz; -dot; -graphs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there has been no modern & GUI; program, which & graphviz; includes, are outdated & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphiviewer; -project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphviz; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphviz; shows graphene with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & Posters; and & konqueror; (so that a change in graphene in & out; recomputes the graph and in & kgraphiviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; to open or to open the graph in & kgraphiviewer; in a nutshell; -component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting about 1000 knot and a hack to represent more than these knot)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further needed software: & kgraphiviewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. requires in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in a separate subwindow. initially, when you start & kgraphviewer; without starting a argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar only contains the symbol file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot; -files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right at pressed & old; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by the factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file was modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphiviewer; can also remember your decision, so that later as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item Preferences kgraphiviewer; set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graphite file outside a current & kgraphiviewer; instance open, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kgraphiviewer; instance, or want to present the graphs to be loaded in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but change it with the setup dialog afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="741">When starting the program, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to one page will be adjusted to this page. if you retain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without headline and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Reft Shop page gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been modified to the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the option to specify the behavior of & kgraphicviewer; specify a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or specify that each time it is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to set the start behavior of & kgraphicviewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session) or decide to be asked at every start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which normally appears with a click in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up more possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose from different & graphviz; -layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the & graphviz website, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered graphs of directional graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge trilaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unlighted graphene. it produces representations according to the jump spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; algorithm creates a spring-spring model for undeveloped graphene. it uses the Fruchterman pure gold houristic, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the node in a circular shape according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">The command should accept the graphite file as a parameter, and print the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms change special options, or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the particular type (dot; for directional, & neato; for uncoated graphene).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is checked, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Displays the What is the -mouse pointer. click on a & GUI; element to get more help to this element (if available).</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module contains tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read pictures from a scanner supported by the Sane project or another source such as video streams. for this to work you need to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item images, a dialog appears that allows you to choose between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to pick the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by using the default ducrhe default values to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you start scanning the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button Scannen, you must wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the target image. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore very large files created. you must also select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screen shots can be created after you have selected in the Import &gt; Screen Saver menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">When all of your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear to allow you to view other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace. if you have selected the complete desktop, only the window under the mouse is read.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts. if you have to switch to other worktops, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screen shot has been shot, the dialog box appears with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to send his photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module exporting to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of creating a token. this is used for your authentication. thus, it is your ID to Flickr. a browser is started to enable you to sign up in Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successfully logging in, the module can send photos to Flickr website. you will be presented the following page after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed Yes, you will see the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. to upload, you need write permission. the module currently does not support any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you click on the Ok button, the upload of the photos to Flickr Server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The word field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Public, Friends and Familly, you can set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose to change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos before uploading will be changed in size. the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is modified so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery export has no documentation at this time. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographical data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical location localization provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, latitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want correlate in the main window and call the menu. the dialog to see above appears then. to load a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. this file naturally contains data that were recorded at the same locations at the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is executed which shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from one place for pictures, you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in min can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually using this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since dialog is the co-ordinates from one call to the next you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. for this purpose, select the region and increase it. always select it again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely out of the KIPI module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in an image gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to provide the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The panel selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenvorschau and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Appearance Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be created in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLSuite containing everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth. this naturally also affects the file size. all other settings are explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider preview images will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser is automatically launched at the end to view the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and pylons. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that the file size increases, as no compression of the color information takes place. this can also be found in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client does not yet have documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please take a look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add a basic image transition between the single images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that will be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can start creating the module via Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures you selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also modify the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should choose the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to replay the file on a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that a picture will be displayed. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value produces very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the mpeg output file. keep the extension mpg as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the movie. once you have adjusted all settings to your preferences, you can start creating the movie with the button. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or calmly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that coding or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the Settings button below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import / convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats such as JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window then appears in mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename will remain the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your images frequently or further use them later, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to retain the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the output button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in one album. it uses the convert program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the picture smaller or enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: not proportional scale change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-preparation: prepare the picture for the photo printing. the user can adjust the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">Once you have started the module, the pictures window will be displayed with the pictures you have selected. you can add more images using the button Add images. for the last selected image, a preview will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw images to the picture list and put them there to add you to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Removing images removes the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the pictures, you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you just have to add the addresses and the subject here. the pictures you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure you don't send too many images at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of emails to send. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is saved and used each time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu Pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in image file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut, so that you can view the status messages, searching for errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions like you want to have your slide show appears. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album here.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions in the presentation activate very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you have to have an appropriate graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">"" "the option" "" "Show File Name" "" "ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option lets you display the presentation in an endless loop. you can then manually terminate it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option Pictures randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the pictures, the temporal distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test it before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, at any transition between the pictures select another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar, you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of submenu, as background for your KDE desktop interface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have completed your pictures and videos with notes, you can use & kphotoalbum; browse them, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, now in each group, i.e. in persons, places and in group keywords entries are available.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you click on the entry with the mouse, the browser view changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images on which both individuals are visible. by using this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the published context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you will need to specify which image should be displayed for each individual. to do this, you will need to open the Picture-View window (in closer description) and select the image for the corresponding person. in the View window, you can customize the image for the corresponding person. in the View window, you can customize the magnifying factor to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you search for the entry in the main window, a dialog appears to you which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can see this dialog again on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the lettering or description field, the captions and descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all the pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, according to pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you do not like to read manuals but rather want to try functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select the demo in the first dialog, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; -demo. then, some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name says, this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">You can switch between the sessions, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries from the database (if you select a date, the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview button) and the timeline will always display the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by holding the mouse button and drawing the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timeline data. if you select an area, you will see only pictures of this time period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures. one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create via the File HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created that is visible on the overview page. you will find more information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed which is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all pictures are of a party. note that all pictures are exported. therefore, you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages are to look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically discussed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so, it can search your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, set the various folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, will start. otherwise, the web browser should be in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. to enable the import feature, see, properly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all three based on base folders or URLs. a subfolder is created in them, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; together, you might want to create your pictures with these. you can of course create an HTML page for viewing the images. however, if you have already spent a lot of time viewing the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not be done again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum, you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if only a link to images is stored in the file. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the pictures together and this file can be passed so independently. the obvious drawback is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the file of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can view from the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is intended for internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the manual Manually close to the .kim file, you need to copy the images into the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With option Automatically copy to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you still want this, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import... select, will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalise the category of people belonging to the importing file (if you are a domain) while this category is called people. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories will match those in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside various picture groups & mdash; if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) setting the information about your images, via (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your images. however, it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all of its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder in which your images are stored and use it automatically in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; i.e., start a different folder with images, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... enter a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, the various settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you see six different symbols, with which you can view settings of preview and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can access by pressing the F1 button and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete groups of members, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of explaining all groups of a member as explained.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his modular system with other graphic applications, such as digicam and gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications among each other, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should first test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures The & kphotoalbum; demo database can either be viewed via the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI together are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage of sharing functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications are arranging their pictures in albums. even though & kphotoalbum; this sort of order isn't supported, it simulates the order of albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have to hand over a list of albums.</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. for example, if you use the category people, you will do & kphotoalbum; so do so if you would have selected people to view and pass on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select the modules which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. below the toolbar, you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but first click on the entry picture, which shows you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any picture with annotations. this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture, where the picture was taken, etc. you can either individually or for a larger number of pictures put certain notes at the same time. if for example, on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">This is a very important part of & kphotoalbum, since you can use it again and again if you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: if you have for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are depicted, you can, by making the used names moved up, find the persons faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetically sorted list, click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected pictures and add these pictures with notes. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons that are located at the top of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window displaying the USA as a supergroup. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. in addition, you can also drag an entry to a category and put it there to make it a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options... which offers, among other things, the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options... and click here to show / hide the window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">When you select the images in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected pictures, or any of the pictures if you have not set a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be displayed in the image viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now the window will show you that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use & kphotoalbum, namely images even without having you stored on the hard drive. of course you need to have the pictures somewhere saved to record it in the database index. in the picture you see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures where the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk. this is, for example, with the images 1-9. for the images 5-9, however, thumbnails are present, so & kphotoalbum; you can also view these pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files out of folders and copy them back into it. & kphotoalbum; does it still not support you to insert the CD in question. so, if you want to avoid trouble such as the mess of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images so that at the end those remaining you want to make for others unavailable and click on the latest view blocks in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also use all the pictures that your little sister may see, control and lock the menu entry everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">So you have defined which images should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry to block images, so that all the images you have locked are hidden. if you want to get the pictures again, click Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select Password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please note that this picture protection is by no means very secure. for one, all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection serves only to forbid those who are with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to forbid the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, you have a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in the picture. of course, it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered via the picture, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where was it made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can drag it with the mouse and discard it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all. all of these options are available right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the matching entries to this display. so, if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image. you can jump to the first and last image with pos1 and end. these functions can also be accessed from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When several images are loaded in the viewer, you can let them run as slide. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can move in and zoom out. to zoom out, you can move a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus key, you can zoom out again. the plus button zoom in the middle of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the Power button sets the zoom, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the functions from the context menu you can turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes on the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can preview the image and open configuration dialog to enter this name. however, you may prefer to highlight just the picture and look at more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while watching them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letters. in this you see a picture in which the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have features on your images, these are available to you in the browser. so if you have all the pictures you edit, print or whatever you have chosen, simply put all at once with notes. this is described in. afterwards, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview. if you want to display categories in the preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, you will allow you & kphotoalbum to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch will not be saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can revert your painted old later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to turn on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; turn on the picture from the context menu. to end the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully mastered, but the documentation to & Povray; should you have absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is displayed yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed to allow you to choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">By deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right-click context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene previously.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to adopt these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message with an error description will be displayed. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; set user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default the whole texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map), check locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse throughout the window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a level of visibility as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the superordinate object, or as absolute value. objects will only be displayed when selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the visibility stage selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window ordering as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window system or if you need a different arrangement, you can adjust it arbitrarily. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or under a existing view, drag the ancker to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the Anfasser to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to assign multiple views to one another, drag the ancker in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flashcards at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are hovering views: views that are not anchored in the main window. in order to solve a view from the anchoring, drag the ancker on the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left in the chamfer strip.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the chamfer bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view allows you to store windows anode... store. it will display a dialog where you can store the windows order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 updated. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on the Rendering icon The icon Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render Modi in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense, however, a name that lets you see the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the size chart, you can enter the width and height of the rendered picture. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality combination field you can select the properties that are used & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection illumination. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User Manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, different errors can arise. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. in general, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling refers to the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because each pixel is always redistributed and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 subpixels that are individually tracked and checked for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called jittering. if you turn on Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import an & Povray; scene, select the menu entry File Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command range of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; want to import, write this source code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRwEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in Property View, opens & kpovmodeler; & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; -Libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects, such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the high level of detail for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window instructions, explain how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window system drop-down selector: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window ordering at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window instructions. a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window ordering is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window system. new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button removal.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with Unten anchor the window under the existing window, with a card map you get a flashcard view together with the previous view and floats the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installs and now you want to start without precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in darkness and you will only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, you can see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset windows order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application as well.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this tutorial, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wireless model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; see for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the Apply button or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the perspective of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insert final body boxes) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, although at the moment only a limited finite level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will see only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the object properties view.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted. please select first sub-object. the pigment will then change in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom pigment), by clicking on the button preview, you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the box and the ball in the preview, just click on the button Apply and then preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called single-color. in the object tree you have to do the entry color list. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select one each time and change the colors in the object properties view:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to carry out this step, as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the object properties view, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the user button), so the ball has contact to the ground. otherwise, the ball would hover over the ground as you have moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface looks like a matt black material. in the next step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose first sub-object and change the name for example in ball Pigment. click on the Pigment sphere, then select one color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if Metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler offers; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracer is a render method to create a two dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen a scene, the rendering of hypothetical rays shoots from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effects.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you see the scene. without a source of light you don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene that is to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and will replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you do not have saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Unusual.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current pane order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, key shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for modifying the keyboard shortcuts. you can change or add new shortcommands for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbars. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler with this option; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A dump map is a way to make rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both dump map and texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application has a file browser where you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Pictures can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can view by clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all pictures should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. if a suitable file name is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

Select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as & amarok; short commands work. this allows you to make your keyboard to & amarok; control centre.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are usually found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists, and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function could look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports Qt and & kde command line options; Amarok also has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use kdialog to allow the user to know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Rescue LoadError error =' Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script. 'dialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow execution of external programs and commands. in this way dcop &gt; is usually called exec (). in this way, dcop &gt; can be accessed relatively easily. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose, strings are written to the default setting of the script. for this reason, scripts should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events when there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Soft the script to display the setup dialog. in order to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange indicates that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, ask more information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume change newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry can be selected. in order to add an own entry to the menu, you can use the Dcop amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle). to remove one entry, you can use dcop amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; terminated, or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed in order to do, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packets downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will accept only script packets with the capture amarokscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packets right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can attach it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. perhaps you're just looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & amarok; 's Collecting browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">You may have some playlists, but you can never decide which ones you want to listen to? then the playlists browser is exactly the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically select the right music based on specific criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers IFP and many generic USB devices. in addition, many different audio systems can be used to choose how you want to listen to your music. these and many other useful features make Amarok the most advanced audio player. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right way to reexperience your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the basic folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & amarok; autoconf and automake do not have any trouble to compile. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& amarok; like most applications, has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of options available.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compilation options, certain dependencies must be met so that they can be used. for details, see the System Preferences section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help in developing & amarok, you should use full.</seg>

<seg id="1214">External browser: lets you choose which browser of & amarok needs to be started when a browser is required.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use another browser: here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save playlist when moving, automatically save the current playlist by pressing & amarok;. enable this option if you don't want to lose the running playlist when moving.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, will be used. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep up-to-date piece changes visible in order to keep the playlists window open / unrolled in order to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing the context browser, automatically change the context browser when the next piece is set.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & amarok; the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the use of different fonts in & amarok; use the otherwise gray shown section. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist window, player windows and context browser. press Select..., so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice of user defined color scheme, you yourself have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selection below for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume playing at the start, that & amarok; after the program start, resume playback automatically with the piece at the place, with which it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Set up the subwindow on-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is applied, a preview of the OSD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the OSD colors for writing and background. a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selections. if your own colors are not activated, the pre-set & kde; colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text shown in the OSD. by entering wildcard holders, the OSD can be adapted to your own needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to specify the screen of a multiple monitor environment to make the OSD appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The audio output card allows you to select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers have further adjustments in this chart.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & amarok; search for music files. to include a folder into the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Recursively browse subfolders: this causes & amarok; both the crossed and their subfolders will be searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enables & amarok; to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & amarok; adding all found playlists to your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will later appear in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is required in the MySql facility.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set the database for & amarok; on calculator: will enter the host on which the MySql database is located. then it is entered under port: the network port under which the database is available. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use username: and password: to enter the data required for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The last.fm card provides support for last.fm. & amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and, if required, create music recommendations regarding the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your Username and Password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send the played pieces and update the profile: this setting allows & amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Invoke similar performers: after activating this setting, & amarok; a list of similar performers to the played piece. note: you don't need a load .fm-profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and other KDE packages. so you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD presume that your window manager considers the relevant standards of freedestop.org. Gnome will work, for example, but Fluxbox will work for instance. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">This is mostly due to the fact that taglib crashes while reading the meta-infos from this file. please report this error to the taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & amarok; is somewhat more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries used by & amarok have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib, but with GCC 3.3.X compiled, this leads to crashes when editing Meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then deactivate autom. disconnect if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the email opens automatically when a crash occurs). if it is a common crash and send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into meta-info, but do not label them as Unicode. the following Perl script solves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib; $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1254">& amarok; s icons are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a well-known error in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten. in some cases, you have to click on a symbol until three times until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9set Pixelation ERK7QPixmap, then please check if Amarok is using the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or modify / etc / ld.so.conf to find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most installation problems clarify most easily by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to search for help. please make only one mistake there, if you have something to fix a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & amarok, only a blank playlist will appear. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To intuitively keep the surface intuitive, the start window has been converted into the statistic window. you can find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the review column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show review. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the review for a piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove, and then press Delf on your keyboard. or right-click on your choice and then select from playlist remove from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file to the playlist with the mouse and drop it down there, just as you would do with other files. that's as simple as: -)</seg>

<seg id="1269">No. yes, that's true! no! & amarok; uses a backend independent approach, therefore the actual question must be: which media types supports GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you see, we support pretty much every imaginable audio format.

<seg id="1270">It may! perhaps you will use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, with which in default no MP3 decoder can be supplied (for patent reasons). the solution: alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 node, input key</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you are using the GStreamer driver with the alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware blender (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (Software Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different sink (e.g. ossinsink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & amarok; already. don't forget that media will need to be decoded first. you can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would just listen to a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Also XMMS decodes the data first. GStreamer can print directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Centre Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound server with highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEMultimedia codecs that can cause distorted playback. read this bug report. enlarging the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you don't use the Arts driver but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE-Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been strongly optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less wearer reacts the visualizations. yes, this is an error, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to go to the GStreamer driver, crashes & amarok; why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you will need to register all the components. follow the registry to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help you can also ask at the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (quit Amarok before!): - Download ampeg, compile and install it. then run all the ffmpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with the scmpeg-config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. start & amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (such as RPM or apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player, it also has & amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to everyone else.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & amarok; Control Centre. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream. directly below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, including the running text display. you can switch from the available analyzer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & amarok; -Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current Analyzer is displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display, you can also use the PL and EQ buttons. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used for setting Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the piece positional slide bar. use the slide bar to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playing and change to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that are in no other player. but don't let the wealth of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left hand side is the navigation pane. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information about the current piece. its look can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, Text and Interpret. these three subwindows are later explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & amarok, you might notice that the subwindow is kicked off. the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of & amarok; in addition, the information can be collected in the statistics window (extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreters and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, performer and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information on the current piece. see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover images in the context browser, the cover pictures must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the Recommended Pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current performer.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last part, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current performer you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be folded up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text, the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if you don't have a text script, you can choose which one should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required to do so.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The search button opens a search on google.com according to the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First pieces are arranged according to performers, and there will be another distribution according to the album. if you want to see constellations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Different Interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / year - Album - Sorted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them according to artist's interpretation.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is also sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button, you can change the settings to the collection. note: & amarok; will automatically record your collection as soon as you change something at the selected folders. if you have many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">There is a search filter directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes on how to use this filter can be found in the playlist section in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter is a selection box, which allows you to filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose from various time windows, ranging from the last 24 hours to a year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order into play.</seg>

<seg id="1378">Pick up a compilation selection - Change a compilation labeled Album back to a normal album. after that the album will no longer be displayed under different interpreters, but again under the associated performer.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to handle many playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>

<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar, there is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser you can find a address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz and press input key, you can access music in the file musi.tar.gz. now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it. in this case, holding the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply moving the entries with the mouse and dropping it. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter into spaces separate search terms, & amarok; searching for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example, one OR two OR 3. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three (or a combination) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, please complete the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not by entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that doesn't contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the keyword: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">For example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bad.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then click on the entries with the right mouse button in the desired order. the entries will then receive a marking with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons follow undo and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>

CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlocking the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The head bar is a narrow area, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the head bar has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key signature for it below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this you need system administrator rights, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is meant to personalize and to fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is equipped like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP interface. with the help of this interface parts of functionality can, for example, be controlled by a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line, or use the more convenient Kdcop program. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task is critical, which of the accompanying programs give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the dcop command line. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following to the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; program have in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject ()</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject-method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project via # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataprojection interface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name, QString parent) void addUrls (Qstring name, QString parent) void addUrls (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, QString NewName) void setVolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiovisual; is an audio CD; -reader for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiovisual; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; -data in WAV files on the hard disk) and by many coding that these WAV files code (compressing). currently, lame for MP3, oggenheim for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) is standardly supported (these coding packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). more coding can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or other formats such as the loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudioguides; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorto (for OGG) or other coding will have to be installed. all of these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, only the coding packages must be installed that are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, the installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to coding, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, use & kaudiovisual; cdparanoia to read audio data from the & CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device does not cover the protection, it is not possible to bypass a protected audio CD; in any case, & kaudioguides; even avoid buying copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), afterwards the daily use of reading a & CD is explained on the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which codec programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">If the CDDB request of the CD-data starts to set up a request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - when an encoder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup catalog - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoders, so selecting with a different encoder can be read as the default. it is important to note that previously the encoder was configured in the code encoding settings in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager so that an already read file will be selected for encoding instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as logs, platforms) for program events (such as reading the & CD; quit).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudioguides; with different flashcards (such as encoder, for setting up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are other such as' shorten 'or' monkey ', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate differences are less important as both codes generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still included with most distributions, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if there is one of the few existing OGG playsets.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices like standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression ratio up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR Common Stereo, compression ratio approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music by young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or automatically fetched from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / use with & kaudiovisual; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the codes and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add titles to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are coded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiovisual must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioguides; parameters that can be used (= button identification in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / input information, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; titles, artists, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of translators: this is the author) am not attorney. however, nobody can prevent you from being harmed by the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiovisual; is active a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb you can use another (fake) address than the used in the system. in this mode of configuration, it seems, the email address will not be used when retrieving the data from the server (but this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudioguides; used to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online recall of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What output program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to store in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; those who want to know more precisely in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see also note that the cdparanoia package from the right distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read WAV files, the coding and thus the desired file format can be selected. in the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenheim (Oggs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the encoding. other codes can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the coding can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined codes. more information on Kodierer is available in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). thereby 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed code.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reading real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio codes of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenheim for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that might indicate what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Did you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will lame '--preset extreme' to produce MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to have cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. for example, a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have write permission (eg; by trying to copy something into it with the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudioguides; something that is probably just done once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read out a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each subsequent & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoding to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with freedb to download the & CD; download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change them on any read-out of a & CD if the appropriate settings are found once.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name will be passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can be accessed, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map General Settings. here there is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is left as left / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information inquire, so that you will be notified when information about creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download over the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: while reading the & CD, the computer must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is simpler, will be a & CD; associated entry starts immediately to read the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later unsatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror- &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">You can work with freedb local in offline mode if you download the database before. however, it is over 620 MB, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data should get the CD? read the section about freedb. put everything as illustrated in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we didn't download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server nearby. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, but as many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. disable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, so simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, check this to check out the & CD; to discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder where the WAV files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is average around 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files at the same time: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than one wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudioguides; this configuration is used as a standard for every read of a & CD; if you chose the organizational structure of your music wisely, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard disk. we will create and set up MP3 files. first, a connection to the Internet is structured as we are comfortable and the & CD; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from those obtained for a & CD; with success from freedb fetched data. hence, you will learn the & CD; to manually input data instead of picking them out of the internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the & CD; find this example. it's a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, the & CD now has to be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this is only when the & CD; as audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, look for help in the section Questions and answers or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all songs are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In case there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there is a window appears, and you can select the database entry that best suits your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Refresh Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Actual Title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidividually per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudioguides; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see the help file to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the issuing CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to freedb.org website and read the information on the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "" "you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. just click on the line to select the piece. make sure all the pieces are selected, or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the selection process has been started by clicking on the selection button, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and trace what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is currently read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You can see this error message when trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed. pieces that were not successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have typed here in the example. do you have checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this lets you read and encoding parallel. note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the code. after the last piece is encoded, a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiovisual, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the coding of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiovisual; is maintained within the & kde; CVS as part of the kdemultimedia package. however, if you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. most distributions contain already a pre-compiled package, since & kaudioguides; a part of an important & kde; package. if you read this, you probably have already done it...</seg>

<seg id="1614">A bad example: sorry, no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiovisual. anyone who wants to add or change something useful may do it. at least only after contacting the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange, if you managed to get the source file from & kde; SVN, then you don't need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke player by & kde; beside others, he also has some features with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts also some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is needed for GUS cards. Alsa is involved as soon as there is a sequencer support.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop to drag & drop you to & kde; any MIDI file from one & konqueror; window can drag on kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files (song events or text events).</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you quit & kde; during playing a song, kmid will start again next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -window to the & kmid; -windows will drop. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button Abplay in the toolbar, select the record from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the & kmid; (for several pieces, you will be added to a collection and then played one after another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and driving back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the speed display and so change the playing speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure appears on the space bar like a print on the pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item, thus interrupts the play. press the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in one piece of music in two ways. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics event and again others both. some pieces do not have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which one song uses, so that you don't have to manually adjust the entry automatic text selection. however, if you select the entry automatic text selection in the Settings menu, you will still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select the entries of text events and song events from the Settings menu. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files you summarise. these are played back in turn. this section shows how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the Collection menu under the item Organize.... Click New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the one you want in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection you will find all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection is not stored. keep in mind when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you need to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song to the Add-on button. there, in turn, you can select the file dialog with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is checked, a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not checked, when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the row from the submenu of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song further, select the next song button, the next song from the menu item, or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the Previous item, the previous one from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map converts general-MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map that transforms all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI-map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the Keymap..." END Define keymap "A further Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compliant.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to set all sounds that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60) which sounds similar to a gun.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the note 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that with the term drum patch the patch is meant, where each sound is a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc.) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as its presence, so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map sounds on the percussions-channel. take a look, for example, the supplied keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply use the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped onto the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyword must be defined further forward in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-bender event with the value n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only forwarded. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM indicates that a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch-bender event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to one octave. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; try.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you will find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see what sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have modified an instrument, the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select the channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The Tempo-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add to & konqueror;, select all files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow keys to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow the playback. to restore the standard tempo, double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & konqueror; -Desktop with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or tacked (when I play a MIDI file) or I want to play a file, just change to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn off the automatic addition to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.M., B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so you set the Automatically add to the collection and open your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.Smid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, that encourages me to continue to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.com Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy simply write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really enjoy a huge joy when sending me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file will be listed under friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me, because I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and didn't get money from anyone for it. I would like to emphasize that I just keep programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AWE cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also goes to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Westheider, Peter Gritsch, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error message or even a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid can be found on his homepage, which is found under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and view images. you will also find links to sites with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you would have a sound card, except that you can't listen to music of course.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by MPlayer or Phonon, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchical level. if you right click on an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the selected entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', TV and permanent playlists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can also be changed from the View menu and next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, it must be selected from the Edit menu with playlist and choose either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost if the editing mode leaves or another group is selected without the same with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some features can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">Animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will keep the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing at the end animation, the user can therefore end the application for a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a startup animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; img dur = "inverter" src = "file: / / / home / koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / gt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, such as setting up the backend by mimetype. here's an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the mime-type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file assignments from KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. if no errors occur here, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">For example, this should be done by changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can be played by TV cards, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before watching TV, the device to be used must be used and the TV channels need to be used, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port should be used. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be found (e.g. PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (presumably this type of playing video equipment under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoformat must be fully functional for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>

<seg id="1752">Just like other label languages, & latex; an introduction to which the general characteristics such as paper format, page numbering and text gres are specified as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ documentclass, the body starts with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The quick entry assistant to & Kile; is an useful feature for the quick creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) offers some options for creating the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this includes the type of document to be created: articles (article), book [book], letter [newsletter], Article (DIN) [scrartcl], Article (DIN) [scrartcl], Article (DIN) [scrreprt], projectors [beamer], films [prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this is used to set the character encoding. modern systems are increasingly using UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8 encoding should be used (for proper processing of & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-on packages for & latex; they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), Book (DIN), Article (DIN), Letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (for compliance with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users do not have to worry. it is only a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source editors - highlighting the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unmatched). if you see more challenging areas of a green text on the screen, it is likely that some mathematical environment is not closed.</seg>
<seg id="1760">When entering a new command (e.g.\\ start {command}) by & Kile; automatically a blank line (for the input of the text) and the corresponding row to write the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the menu box; set up... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files, recovery search can be very helpful. once a DVI; file [is independent file (engl. D e V ice I nort File)]), & Kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as font and is beside PDF the official output type of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When looking back, the elements of the DVI-file are attached to the editor and as soon as one element in the DVI-file is clicked, the corresponding section in the & latex; source code is clicked.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide Master document can be set to project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick build: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (if there are no bugs in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file will be bereaved and there is no call from & Okular; after the rapid construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection boxes should be located. the selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for the quick breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is for items such as keywords, footnotes or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, a picture or a different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (selection of a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation, a selection list with literary inserts is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; -files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size. it is possible to specify the font boxes for the main text, marks, etc., the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the Wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Parentheses after the\\ documentclass command contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font. if the font does not set at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or the push of a button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; the storage will automatically execute.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If you fail to compile the document, it should be searched for errors in logging. if you use rapid build-up & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only checked within the area (from\\} {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and user-friendliness of the document. it can, for example, be added to certain fonts, liposure, coursessive pressure, subsubmissions, etc. these commands end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the coursing pressure and is long enough until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in one sentence can be displayed italic with\\ emph {Word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ 'quota: creates a quote in the document. quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source text with the & latex; markup language is shown, follow a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments to the better readability of the document should be performed. to do this, a quote, a few places in the bold and coursing pressure, and a poem may be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI-file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file are the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed using File Print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file has been created from the & latex; source code is created, the conversion into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preference search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Binding files. to do this, you just have to set Modern under Settings box... tools Construction can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To execute the pre-selection search, the mouse pointer needs to be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on pre-select search. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer then takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Okular; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document from & Kile; opened and selected to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Okeyepiece; set as text editor (setting up the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should an error occur when using the & DVI; if there is an error, this will be shown in summary in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file tells the source code of the source code. in the editor, the previous LaTeX errors and newer LaTeX errors can be used for jumps between errors. in order to view the flawed line, the error in logging must be clicked and & Kile; navigates to the correct line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the pre-set options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to create a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Typical users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings box... Settings general.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by typing in document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created. if a simple way of creating a template is required, it should be searched for one on the Internet and are executed through the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& ates; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and raising of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be made directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about it and its possibilities, the handbook should be drawn to Kate. users of & Kile; can start working there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called via the menu LaTeX Reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed string button to select the & tex; this means that in this way, clicking on\\ par of\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with left mouse button, the selected text is copied automatically to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the various types of source texts and to highlight it. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can come up with additional jump tokens. this is an own type of bookmark within the text. the menue modifiers, jump tokens, or the respective push-button activate the jump to the next or last jump token. this is also highlighted in this jumping stamp, so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & Kile; although & Posters; already offering excellent opportunities, in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex. & latex; requires always many environments and groups and therefore support & Kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this enhanced meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. the only preventive thing in & Kile; is that the slots are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this option also has an extended meaning, since this command also contains & latex; commands with a back-line (\\) and an additional star (*) should be selected at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key. & kile; offers the keyboard shortcut Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit Remove the following commands are included for the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for further commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front of or inside the\\ begin {environment} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, you can quickly get lost. this command will close the most recently opened environment, so that the nested ambient structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands corresponding to those from edit surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the closing clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the cursed clip of an & tex; group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested group parentheses you can quickly get lost. this command completes the last opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>

<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double check mark may be set up under Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for specific settings (e.g. german or French) and thus German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When you are using Shift, enter + Kile; a smart line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Complete the current line with\\\\ associated with an ending line break.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already providing a good source code execution, it was added to & Kile; three different modes are built-in. three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings box...</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment by the command\\ begin {surroundings}, & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {surroundings} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and erroneously deteriorates the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed from the selection of a command. alternatively, bouncing brands can be inserted, so that a simple jump to these positions is possible using the jump brand NÃ ¤chest jumping mark and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>

<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the processing of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call of the complete recovery mode will result in a large list of ambient commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for processing environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When invoking the complete environment or the Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment automatically initiates and it appears\\ begin. afterwards, the ambient loading can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button to exit.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is complete, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & Kile; realize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is included.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; All settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of default mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>

<seg id="1891">You can add no or more parameters via the libxslt parameter section of the dialog. this allows the transfer of parameter values to the style template.</seg>
<seg id="1892">To apply the required changes, click on the button Ok. the breaking of Cancel discards any changes.</seg>
<seg id="1893">The dialog can be closed by pressing X in the right upper corner of the window. once the settings are changed, you can change the dialog once more.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Once the style sheet is started, it can be used in the Debuggen Inspect menu... then click on the tab Show points, as shown in the example below.</seg>
<seg id="1895">A filename can be an absolute path to a local file. or just the filename (eg; xsldoc.xsl).</seg>
<seg id="1896">A template or model name can be a fully qualified name, with which the non-local part is optional, e.g. xsl: mytemplate is already designated by mytemplate</seg>
<seg id="1897">First click the dipping point in the list of the current holding points. then press the button to remove.</seg>
<seg id="1898">The status of a certain holding point is displayed in the corresponding text with a different background color. the desired color can be selected: see Settings EditorSettings dialog, on the page Colors.</seg>
<seg id="1899">You can set, disable or delete a holding point using keys, the Debug menu or the symbols in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Most of the output from & kxsldbg; is captured and either in stage manager... dialog or in & kxsldbg; output window shown. the following exceptions apply:</seg>
<seg id="1901">The various tools are available through the Debuggen menu, where the stage management tool is most important.</seg>
<seg id="1902">By clicking on a step-by-step selection in the menu, a dialog for choosing the speed of the run is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1903">To stop the process, press the W button or select step-by-step execution in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1904">To track a system ID in the current & XML; catalog, select System ID... in the menu and enter the value to be searched for in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1905">To post a PublicID, select PublicID... from the menu and enter the dialog to be searched for.</seg>

<seg id="1909">If the inspection dialog does not appear, select Debuggen Inspect... from the menu. to edit the sources, click on the Properties tab in the appearing dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1910">All found templates are listed here. it is important to note that the export rules of & XSLT apply. therefore, multiple templates can be present with the same terms and mode details.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Clicking a template entry in the displayed list moves the text pointer in the main window to the corresponding line of this file.</seg>
<seg id="1912">Local and global variables are shown on a map in the Xsldbg inspector dialog. the following example shows XSLT source code in which a global and a local variable is declared</seg>
<seg id="1913">By clicking on a variable from the list, you get a summary information in the dialog below. if a variable is a particular expression, for example</seg>
<seg id="1914">Contains, then a new XPath can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the expression button.</seg>
<seg id="1915">When clicking a variable entry in the list, the text pointer will be transferred to the corresponding line of this file in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration in & quantaplus; all these tools use commanders interface and libxml2 and libxslt as a subsystem. the combination gives quick, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Anyone who has worked with the & kde; documentation knows myproc and how superior it is. let's take it a bit, we give it a graphical interface! no more dependent on a terminal; simply clicked on the symbol for the XML processor and done!</seg>
<seg id="1918">This application expects a index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is located in the required working folder, then leave the current working folder. if not, then remove the selection of current working folder and specify the folder in the field of other folders.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML; files are deleted every time you run my _ proc.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As already said, anyone who has worked at the & kde; documentation has already worked, knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus, there is now a great graphical interface for it.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the currently opened file is index.docbook, simply select the current working folder. if not, then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index.docbook can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1922">If it comes to an output on the screen, your file is flawed. please check the reported errors and try again.</seg>
<seg id="1923">If the file to be checked is already marked in & quantaplus, then the current file is simply attached. if not, delete the crochet in the current file and select the file to be checked by another file - file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1924">If you only want to know if the well-formatted file is well-formatmed, click the Well-Formed review selection.</seg>
<seg id="1925">To use a & DTD; which is specified in the & XML; file, select & DTD; (External), otherwise & DTD; (External) and specify the location of the & DTD; by definition URI; both for the & W3C; & XML; schema as well as for RelaxNG review is the specification of the definition URI; in the file selection required.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Yes, & quantaplus; also has an & XSL; -processing tool! this is using the xsltproc tool from the libxml2 library.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Should the file to be processed in & quantaplus; already selected, then let the current file simply be selected. if not, remove the selection of current file and select the file to be processed by the other file.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Specify the name of the file as the result should have named. the file is usually stored in your home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, which & quantaplus; ladet, have with & quantaplus; themselves possibly little to do. this makes the plug-in system very powerful. you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the counterfeit in & quantaplus. the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start editing plugins using the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all contained plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location, & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often, several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship with each other. & quantaplus; supports the provision of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and serves for clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have multiple roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking for the team member from the list and pushes the button Setze. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold after which they are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of one's own identity are important in terms of messages and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Besides the overview of your team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that takes a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the site event configuration of the Shift; F7 project project settings dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project manager. see how such ladder can be set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal commentaries by the following:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To insert notes is simple. it can either select the note entry from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a determinable member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ ANotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with the nickname of the subproject manager, role in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the brackets and the name: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages, which is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings can be reached via the Settings menu. here, only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the other can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using the Quanta settings... This dialog stretches across some pages that are treated sequentially.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lower case of tags: large / lower case of automatically inserted tags. normal case-sensitive, the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lower case of attributes: large / lower case of automatically added attributes. normal case-sensitive, the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags: if checked, is inserted for tags for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: as above for all other tags except simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update the start and finish tag: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacing of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detecting different types of files. restore standard settings using the Standard button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise known as with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be bypassed). however, this setting is affected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is affected by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in one's own view (or documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to look at the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has come across by changing the MDI modes and andocken / dependencies of views. it corresponds to the --reset layout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and source text view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the illustration of the parser nodes in the document, can be set into details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the context of structure tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically. empty nodes are empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be validated for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP where the ifclause abbreviation is slightly different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins can be managed here. plugins are KPart-applications from third party, which can be re-used by any Kpart-capable application, the most well-known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information will be passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "component in" "" "Read Only" "" "mode: check if the plug-in is denied loading. only Lese-KParts typically refuse loading if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is checked, then test & quantaplus; if the inserted information is correct, then save the entry if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting has been completely redeveloped. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger has been set, as well as support for the dbg debugger.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently there is only one plug-in available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. normally appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed with time numbers and conditions. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, anything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if required, or it tells the plug-in to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened which uses a debugger so that normally no attention has to be paid.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debuggen Session Start the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the running according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is shown in the debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Tells the debugger to start executing the script and sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it started before a debug request started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to overweighted variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution continues. if there is a debug request, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next statement in the script, where possible in functions and include is incorrectly adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Open a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work of Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; ist ein & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg, which they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how to adapt & quantaplus to your needs and how to help & quantaplus; helping to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus. they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility make & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, script languages or & CSS; & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and toolbars. tag folders include two file types, the tag folder and toolbars. tag folders are handy, symbolic links of image knobs (above the editing window), the text and statements can be inserted faster into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how tagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also tool bars. in short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog, the & quantaplus; for tag. the & descriptionrc file contains the rules and information of & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without a risk of a writing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder bear the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and boundaries is described in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing else than just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the class type. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">This text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a just element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. in addition, there are other tags describing how this attribute should be displayed & etc. this is a just-element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code for the attributes in tag editor dialog and attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to reach source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tag name%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouped the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is a just element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in dialog. this tag should be present for each field in dialog box (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a just-element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is a just-element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & lt; notes. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt;</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check takes place only when loading the TagXML file in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following, an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following, an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overloading function is described. the filename of this tag XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! doctype tags &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for attainable via DTD editing DTD settings. this can be edited by diedescriptionrc; for a list selectable & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Verstice 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings actions... created. click New action to create the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The button abbreviation assigned to this action. with clicking on the user defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner, the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailiated settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; themselves are the quick start dialog or the different see in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in its path: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in its path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / is removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: replaces the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be added to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can accept input from & quantaplus; in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document will be sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The output of the executed application can also be diverted according to the input. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the default output; error messages, to the standard output output. it can be specified what should happen to the text written to the standard output by setting the value of the output selection field:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in a given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the right tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan to use its use, enable "Edit Tag" dialog if available so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics more programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Editing size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually regarded as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking on this symbol will insert a & lt; - tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must be connected with the action. this is done via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags if there is any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the tool bar to set dialog via Settings tool bar. make sure the toolbar you want is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Conqueror Preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the Start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by applying all the symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After neweXML doesn't exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your & descriptionrc, so that your tool bar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notorious enlargement of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository whether someone has done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file. we leave the first part to you, the second we will handle here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html = Sec2.2.html &gt; tag1 = tag2html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and logical at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & lt; notes. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that serves to form context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts will display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements separated by sample that are supposed to be available (for & PHP;, these are the features of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that they are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -repository. you won't be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the lost resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">Resources can be sent to friends, partners or otherwise by email. in different places there is an e-mail menu item, such as DTD DTD packet (DTEP) with email, send toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions will be reviewed and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. to make a donation, we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a GPG / PGP key.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase will not be saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool bar toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, researches & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signaling. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a notification appears with the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages, which is currently not yet supported by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is a simpler way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and conversion of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">New type tag: the string that is to appear in! doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd will appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor to be adapted with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and to be able to draw full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this differentiation concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus; from tool bars to actions, everything that is marked as global is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emoggles the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the multipliers with information and the toolbars. please check in, and for more information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing, reloading, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or version of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Rectangles in the Editor area result in a further context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the tags under the mouse pointer, help the word under the mouse pointer or opening the file, when the string under the mouse pointer refers to a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. at present, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional serves as a standard for which a set of toolbars is displayed. as part of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; PGT; insert into your document, then click on the icon representing the tag. now, you can paste the data for this straight-added day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate to & quantaplus; navigate, open and roam. in the representation with multipliers are available for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes, and documentation building views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage media can be done with the contextual menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, an entire website, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. by clicking on the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script. by clicking on the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands opens with reference to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. it can quickly change attributes and namespaces with it. the content-oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add, edit and view project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two leaders at the bottom end of the window, can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about any script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab displays all errors in the pop-up of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the appropriate command. the toolbar's chocolate page is the option to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you get a toolbar in an email, you can secure it in & quantaplus; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; -files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of her bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be noted that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why development, which someone else developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details see the help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; insert, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta execute).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supported by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest record being taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting from the clipboard there are special characters to & HTML; -write, so that they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts text from clipboard to & URL; -Description, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Enables you to select text blocks using the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script gives error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Shows the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Starting and switching the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries predictions or next, depending on the position of cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; -projects are saved with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Search the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows you to copy video files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in Chapter & Quantaplus; projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbars. allows you to select the type of tool bar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. that only creates the name. actions need to be saved using the Settings... actions. toolbars will be saved using toolbar toolbars or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the tool bar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; that you or someone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP should be freshened without renewing the whole & DTEP. if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the store will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the toolbar currently loaded. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. smart insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting using tool bar is denied if this tag contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on it. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available default schemata depends on the version; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes require time or create unnice graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or subwindow mode that corresponds to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. selecting a entry will enable the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars or which add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, as, for example, after completing the project name, the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted with Shift; F7 project project characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and modify. with server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc.) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If a project is started from scratch, do not hook up. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the files you want by hooks or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. in the menu tree project properties, these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree in the subwindow Profile or Shift-F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the Project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible) can be ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read in more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button. in this case, troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, high-load profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by contacting one's own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn event actions and add, modify or delete these actions. event actions are executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, choose Open Project... from the Project Project or the project symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allow the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and open with... in the context menu available with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if there is only one profile available, the button will be blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten in the program. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the more uncertain password on the disk store option is not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it according to your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easily, but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e., by simply tugging in the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted in the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via the tool bar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplus; to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are the best tool for customizing the toolbar's toolbars. the addition of toolbars is added at the bottom of the Toolbar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which a new tool bar can be created, other actions such as tool bar can be executed, toolbar renaming or toolbar can be executed, which can be indicated which actions should be visible on this or other tool bars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action edited that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu with Settings... and set Settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code snips and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you set up for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. there can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc. binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. typically, special documents are made in corresponding subfolders. it is a simple scaffolding for the purpose and organises the work in an appropriate way to be efficient. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template, but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure as desired (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As a template save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template), the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Creating binary templates is simple: copy the file into a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as pulling and dropping or inserting via the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project file, select a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal-oriented approach. you can give headlines and footers or dynamically link with & PHP; shape, insert, or link with them. in addition, you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">Template structure in subwindow templates is based on the files submitted in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, click the template with the right mouse button to click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types described above; files, text or templates. this selection is blended as soon as the attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set up, it would deactivate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-tree. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a particular project, allowing for copying of content templates to a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally, you can use context menu (to show right mouse button) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one location to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be accessed via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to the source editor when necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; -editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document, which & PHP; contains, a small green symbol indicates the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit it, the source editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously. using F9, this mode is activated, this mode is already active, offset the active cursor from one window to the other, and the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and source editor is configurable via settings Quanta. after selecting VPL, you can select between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation applies: a small gap for fast calculators and a large range for slow ones.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming that you want to change the title of the website, tools document properties can be selected. this allows the editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; this is used to reduce the manual encoding. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the contents, e.g. keywords on the column Name and Keyword Keyword 2 on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the meta elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursor is as in a word processor, by moving with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves independently. the marker works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and dropped by means of a back button or margin key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way using the toolbars, as in the source editor. it is to be noted that inserting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed from any other surrounding anchors tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the Table Assistant or the Listen Wizard are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for analyzing style sheets. unlike other programs for style sheets, the search for specific elements is possible and the style template can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2275">Multiple commands require more than one argument. quotes can be used to deliver composite expressions as an argument. & eg;: with the command "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" as argument, a holding point is set in a file named "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time correcting the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes. the merge editor under the differences windows enables resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; for folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today color monitors. if you need to check the codes frequently, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more annoyance if someone alters the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, you can make typing in the file by simply writing the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">For example, this folder can be used as folder. folder 1 folder 2 kdiff3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 2 folder 3-o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows for manually typing filenames, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting an recently opened file from the drop-down list. opening dialog will notice your selection and show them again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences will be done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merging of folders is initiated. if a file is selected for B and C, however, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field will be active and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setting button opens a dialog with settings. you can set options here before starting the merge / merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. in the opening dialog, you don't have to select files, you can close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would have to create two corresponding files, download them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at present, you cannot remove anything from & kdiff3; just dropping text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows is optional.) Every information line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized you can see the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. this is good in the next section (merge) good.</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (C / C + +, for example, white notes are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line will be dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison window) also contains an info line with the wording:, the filename and [Shift] when you edited the result. usually, it contains text by automatic merge, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two benchmarks are used, each difference at the same time must also be resolved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button into the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed.) This group will then highlight the current group.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic merge or manual editing, no more line is left in the group; then it is displayed in these lines of text & lt; no row in the queue; this text appears neither in the final saved file, nor in a marker you might copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the results window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled when selecting the sources, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white notes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page, side, beginning, end, string beginning and string end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the default window, you can also use the other keys to edit. with the Insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture Inward / Ctrl-picture Abroad) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark into the clipboard, you need to press the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion). if this is checked, whatever you mark, will automatically be copied to the clipboard and the manual copy is eliminated. however, be careful with this option because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use cart backfeed + newline feed\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line end of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the program and restored at the next start. (menu Options - &gt; KDiff3)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you enable this option, differences in italic font are displayed. if the selected font does not support this description, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered astert. on these systems, the knob presets presets automatically an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tablator button. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selector is automatically copied to the clipboard. manual copying into the clipboard is then omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first, to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white notes can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are ignored. even when merging white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return character '\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, but then files with different sizes may look identical in page-on-page comparison although they are different. if this option is checked, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The option is enabled in the default setting. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict is continued.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you need this from time to time, use better the functions Chole A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also applies to conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter for scanning folders and performing merging. see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already exists an older version, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if you already have such a backup file with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further securing.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Changing this option does not affect the current program. you need to quit and restart, so that the change will be active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is globally adjusted via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for encoding, a short note appears, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding to be used to save.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn on this to suppress emphasis of changes in white characters in the text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when comparing three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded oversight column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just send out the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart merging, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first hand it to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command will be displayed, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that exactly meets your requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first hand it to this external command. if a normal preprocessor command is specified (see above), the output of the command will only be used at the end of the line. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program this by themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for lines to convert the input into uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergularly expression that matches any string. the\\ 1 in the replacing string refers to the found text in the first log-pair. the\\ U converts the found text into uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further preprocessing command for line breaks. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Any character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hits will be replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform multiple replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / REGEXP / Erase / SCHALTER 'However, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be maintained for viewing and merging. other operations only change the data that the line-like Algorythmus can see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the pointer preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge complete folders with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... make a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate merging and displays the simulated changes without really carrying out them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... execute selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and merging of single files. you only need to open files on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as a base. if no target folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a small message box about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files that have been compared will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is completed, & kdiff3 shows; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can fold up a folder by double-clicking on the + / - click on the object or by double-clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu includes two functions All sub-directories and fold up all subdirectories with which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the comparison window is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The name of the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the A / B / C column and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the connection clock action cannot be selected automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow, and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B one file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B one file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified, and if the option Directories is active. then, select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that later both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsafe) is checked, then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not removed, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging a file is processed after the other. you status column shows skill when merging was successful, and corresponding other messages when something unexpected occurred. if merging is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the connection actions (even in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a target folder, then the three-folder merging mode C will be used as the target, the two-folder merging will be selected as the target and will be used for synchronizing A and / or B as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries should be in the target folder, also displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to only merge the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. they can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options Browse, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate if you would like to see what would happen without the real changes made. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, select start / resume directory merge again, or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you eliminate the cause of the problem. if you continue the merge (F7 key), let & kdiff3; you have the option to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you continue with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, the entries (in the current session) will not merge again. even if the merge was skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set to a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystems, a preceding point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: when the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links will show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is turned on, the links like normal folders are treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not available for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to an endless loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of confidentiality of the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal. this can, for example, be useful if the change date has been lost when copying.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that later both folders are identical.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copy of the newer file will be proposed as action instead of merging. (this is considered unsafe because the knowledge assumes that the other file has not been changed.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will also be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually the folder merging view persists while merging individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also create a single file directly, without having to start the folder merging. once you save the result, the status will be set to empty and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merging.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path may be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters need to be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, empty &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. there is a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder is shown. then, a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or modification date deviates from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">At the moment KDEVELOP always starts with the built-in differences viewer. to start KDEVELOP, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select in Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, accepts & kdiff3; then remove & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Conqueror, you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it's compact) already exist. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by dragging myself into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who went this way or will go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably not notify the configure script to KDE. in default install configure in / usr / local, but then KDE will not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will first be treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has been too big to date. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to process large volumes of text, a different editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly cooled; no src is lapped; and the text can't be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For a list of recent changes, see http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used, you should not have any problems with compiling. should there be any difficulties, please report to the & kde; mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift Remove) to the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift Insert) paste the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore also not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you have to update the folder with the Update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries that show differences. this also results in the fact that identical files are not copied to the target folder when merging. if the target folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the caption A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button again.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a miniature preview of all virtual working surfaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, stop them or shift them. this works both inside a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual working areas as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both within a work surface and on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu only has the two entries Pager set up... and exit. if however, on an application within & Kpager, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on desktop and exit. the commands cause the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, the names of the virtual working areas are displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field allows the & Kpager to display the numbers of the virtual working surfaces. if it is crossed along with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in & Kpager;</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is checked, the current programs will be displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only empty workspaces will be displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply displays simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classical allows & Kpager; in a 2 x N raster, as from pager applications in some other Windows managers, horizontally displays all virtual working surfaces in a horizontal row, which is very good for viewing laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and move the windows as icons or with its contents. moreover, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then select Setters to set up the dialog box... makes the dialog box appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you need to enter the key windowTransparent mode and assign it to this value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager is part of the kdebase package, you need a working installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2483">In the default setting, & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a moveable loupe. alternatively, you & Kmag; this causes a selected screen area to be displayed in the magnifying window (selection mode) or the environment of the mouse pointer on the edge of the screen (eg; on the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the settings mouse pointer. please note that & Kmag; currently not yet able to detect the form of the mouse pointer. this is always the default kde; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the content of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift; button or use the & MMB; you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window will stand firm and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), turn the picture and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop updating the display. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is required.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window will appear. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& Kmag; automatically uses your set short commands to save files, open a new window, print, reload (with the document recharge in & konqueror;), popup and shredder & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Kmag is also known as & kmagnifier; it is a screen lupe. you can use & kmagnifier; to do this, you can use a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visual disability.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse cursor is waiting for a while in the same place. it is intended to help people who suffer from RSI syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Injury syndrome) and which each mouse-click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse cursor is waiting for a while in the same place. it is intended to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click emulate pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, even by simply moving the mouse, pain can also be caused. if you suffer from pain associated with your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even though & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by mouse clicks, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; it's simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click once you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after having emulated the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the release of the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can drag the drag on pressed mouse button. the smart move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must reach after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; execute a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes Move is enabled, the shooting time is switched off (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait before the mouse button is released again, if no moving of the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking on the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; to reduce the response time. go to the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, choose Sound System and here the Rider General. there is a slider sound buffer, which you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at any start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available. at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">If you have already pressed the user button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last button is pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the smart move should be switched off first. if you have adjusted to the automatic mouse click, you can later remove the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; to decrease in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should make yourself aware of the position of a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window that does not link, does not lead to unwanted reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can scrape the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you own a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it. however, you can park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input. this allows accidental moving of mouse clicks without causing unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to select text to copy it into the clipboard and to re-insert it or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool; instead, select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and pressing the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this is displayed every time & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. thus, you know exactly when when moving the move time. later, you can use the smart move even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & cmousetool; to be able to use the XTest extension for & X Window; this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; use the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor is short. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI's syndrome and those who have pain in the mouth of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured in such a way that there is a certain time waiting for a drag process to start before the mouse button is released. in this way, drag and drop can be performed with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2533">On the second page, select the default text passbook. from the text passages you can select frequently used text passages without having to type them. the text passages can of course be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screen shot) you determine the dictionary for the word completion. & kmouth; reads the KDE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of each word. additionally, you can compare the wordlists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary so that only correctly spelled words are added to the word supplement.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your propositions (the lower white field in the screen shot) and a running memory of the already spoken propositions (the upper white field in the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">If you have played kmouth correctly, you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field. each spoken sentence is attached to the outlet memory. you can select phrases that are to be spoken again.</seg>
<seg id="2537">With the Settings kmouth menu entry, set up the dialog box from & kmouth. this dialog provides two flashcards, voice output and settings, page word completion, and the KTTSD language service page.</seg>
<seg id="2538">In the input field of the voice output voice output, enter the command to call the language generator. in the drop-down box below the input field, specify the character encoding to pass the text to the language generator.</seg>
<seg id="2539">& kmouth; knows two ways to pass the text. select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the voice generator.</seg>
<seg id="2540">If the check box is not selected, the text will be passed on as parameters. you can use the following wildcards:</seg>
<seg id="2541">Of course, the command to voice output depends on your language generator. you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator. examples for this can be found in the appendix.</seg>

<seg id="2543">With the first selection box action after selecting a text passage, you determine which action is triggered by the shortcut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passages book or in the bar for text passages.</seg>
<seg id="2544">With the selection of Instant Talk the selected text passage is spoken directly and added to the default memory. with the selection of In the input field, the selected text passage is first entered into the input field.</seg>

<seg id="2551">With this option you create a new, empty dictionary without entries. da & kmouth; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary, you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The main area of the window to edit text passages is divided into two. in the upper part, the text passages are represented as tree structure.</seg>
<seg id="2553">In the lower part you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the associated shortcut. if you have selected a text passage book, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">Add actions such as new text passages or books, or delete selected text passages and books, either by selecting in the menu bar, in the toolbar or via a drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="2555">You can change the order of text passages textbooks or text passages by dragging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the & Alt key.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is edited before being sent to the speech dispenser program. they are useful for improving pronunciation to replace false spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and spokesperson or to bypass certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the operation of filters, it is important to know how the "speech dispatcher" program works with a text. & ktts; differentiates four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops them. if the output of the screen reader is read, the retained orders will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning takes precedence and holds the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News is the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a website, you can start with & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kde; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text assignments. every job you hit from the card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text assignments. textual assignments are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & tts; just one such preview, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replacing parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & tts; is supplied with pre-defined string replacement filters, which enable the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformulation of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set limit detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs can start reading text into individual sentences. this allows & tts to start faster with the pre-reading, since only the first set must be synthesized, not the whole text order. this allows you to skip or pause jobs on the card card, even if the speech synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">At the first start of & ktts, a set limit detection filter is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add further set-limit identifier filters, but beginners are advised.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to get to know the setup of the speaker selection by trying out. switch on the speaker selection and select text to read. switch on the subscriber selection, change some features and check how the speaker's selection changes. you have to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& tts; then faster to start reading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can order or cancel text orders on the card card orders, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limit recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator character (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limit detection filter, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>

<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the speaker you want. if this property does not play a role, don't give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue, it is always treated as a primary property. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is present if you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all features in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the default speaker button and then use the speaker that is most likely to follow the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is for the last word order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. for this to work, the program must be sox installed and discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card for subscriber devices. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">(this is because the HTML is converted to SSml.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; by & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of & HTML; -after-SSml reshaping filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows the management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; displayed. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured to make & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and the setting of network features enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed for installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and the release date. by checking the setting No-again questions the definition can be permanently hit.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are gray displayed, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you can enter the system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Network Interface Panel is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be carried out by the rider network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed on the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... to set up in the dialogue device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are done at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option Manual, without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration can be performed. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field Network mask, the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching off an outdated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the computer in the local subnet, which mediates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host is calling http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS dissolves this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator part of the name resolution allows easy administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. entries can be placed in the list by selecting a entry or downgrading or downgrading in the list with the buttons Hinauf or Herunter.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to name resolution a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be added to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button. it will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list name known calculator describes host-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily when booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, DNS servers can replace it.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list of publicly known computers contains some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this still in test version of IP is intended to replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button. if the known computer has multiple alias names, press the Add button repeatedly and enter the additional alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">"" "select an entry of an especially known computer from the list and select Edit...." "" "Edit dialog" "" "will be shown." ""</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages), it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installing the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface can be used like kpackage or the installation tool for your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second section all of & knetworkconf; changing configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been widely used. IPv6 is expected to be deployed in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & off; workstation is the network administrator to use a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a particular area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">Smaller networks usually use addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = one's own machine). the default route is needed for IP transfer.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 has its own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is another content found there in the event of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected can happen.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first consisted of creating a surface for tar which also provided the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective unpacking.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be integrated by & kdat. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; pulls the tape back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognizes & kdat; the pre-tensioner on the tape does not, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the prespann, searches for the right index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the Status Bar an appropriate message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by flapping the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates by changing the symbol for the tape, that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & kdat can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat. if your tape drive assumes that a tape can be formatted before use, this must happen before you are formatted by the tape of & kdat. floppy disk drives usually require formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity drives & kdat, continuing with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape will be lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you run the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only be backed by this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are saved.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is started, the dialog box opens up for backup. in this dialog, you can review the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the backup dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the drive entry. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkout process is started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog, you can review your selection and change the working folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the check, the dialog appears to check. this dialog displays the progress of the examination process, as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files to be restored must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore from the Restore menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process is started, the dialog for Recovery will appear. in this dialog, you can review your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the recovery settings, the dialog will restore. this dialog displays the progression of the recovery process, as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the tape indexfile on the basis of the belt content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can rewrite the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup is to take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the newly selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files on the same file system are backed up like the folder. folders that are on other filesystems can be placed separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that has been used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding option of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the tape is involved, the command lends load to the drive. on some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; to lock the outlet in the tape drive. possibly this setting will not work with all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the tape is automatically kicked off. do not use this option for floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat. not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need & kdat; in any case report the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat, a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is a hostname: seconds, with hostname the complete name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that run directly with & GNU; tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it does not deal with incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to receive information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access, for example, to information about issues that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features, with which help the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of logfiles, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with whose help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be filtered easily and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog; initially the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open. it will not appear to you, and it will open instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely not with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for which normal user usually does not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or set of strings. the list of the log-lines is now automatically changed, so that only log-lines will be displayed that match the selected filter. in the default setting, a protocol line will be displayed only if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, select another entry at this point. for example, the string of the filter search term will be matched only with entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system protocol select the column process, and add the name of a process in the filter bar, so you will show & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as protocol lines of the step note. the color display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to show specific processes (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron Protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. for example, this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to skip to new lines in the main window's context menu, to display all new protocol lines added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows displaying several protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you can find more up-to-date information on the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can be found in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program start-up of the system in the & Linux; world. and this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I won't go into historical aspects here (for example because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not below / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to system V Init without installing a new installation and reformat. so you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service that you want to start when you start the system or change to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">You can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably note that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can manually edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you come to repair it by restarting the system and run:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do all the correct scripts start? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be invoked with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user running level, which & eg;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will only be removed from its initial runlevel (or position). this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the field of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you have to edit the sorrows of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different work areas (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the input key to open the Properties dialog. use the tabulator button to change the properties dialog. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of loss of data, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv, intended for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not conform to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available from the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply quit without a message when their configuration files are not available or set up incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual may be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; to start, it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaptation of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either you can use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with double-click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled user settings (quota) for users, a card will be created on which you can make individual adjustments. additional flashcards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password management appears if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if the quota for at least one built-in filesystem is activated and initialized (identifiable to the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the space limitations in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected using the field filesystem with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Groups tab informs about the group members of the selected user. the standard group, which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add to the User or Group menu, or click the matching Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user / group works alogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change boot password, change time to boot from the standard operating system, add, remove, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify, modify and modify the boot password.</seg>
