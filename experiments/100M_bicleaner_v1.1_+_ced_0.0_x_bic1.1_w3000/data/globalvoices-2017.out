although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film .
at the age of 14 , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as a law student covered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been like this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain as it is said so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can pres@@ election was the highest number ever achieved by a candidate nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , Tr@@ ump@@ et Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung agreed not to agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
tr@@ umps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still adap@@ ts to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values incar@@ n@@ ated by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception to the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom know , have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that they have disappointed ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( NB . Ü ) : as much as &quot; rebellion of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; word@@ play made of white in reference to the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as whi@@ r@@ ling injuries , as the great Van Jones described , has killed exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America is welcome everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of an Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ean , whose story , as he says himself , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , a huge portion of the white America promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices cried lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , it is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and this is my heart .

out of the misery to the stars : these Latin American children aren &apos;t spo@@ iling their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Fli@@ ck@@ r user OE@@ A @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what has the Mexican Music School of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular with tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) plays in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest to the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ al violence .
but this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope of hope .
the young band members are very serious about their obligations to the music group , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always play laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments composed of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura where the Recycl@@ er led by Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez to turn parts of waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , contra@@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all produced from the garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the initial period :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash The children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio had shown something he had never seen before : a violin made out of tr@@ ash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments of re @-@ prepared material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , the world produces about one billion tons of tr@@ ash .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully tackle illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
re@@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known at the time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Liber@@ ian waters before the other coast of Africa was seeking .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal off@@ ender of this kind at their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to dock one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries which simply refused everything &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team that the ship discovered and pursued at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it did not succeed in catching fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pil@@ lage of fish stocks in the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries who then expelled the premi@@ er from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is trapped is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate failure of existing laws to protect certain habitats and species can damage the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the slu@@ g emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are happening these days in real time , with track@@ able on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also very atten@@ tively pursu@@ es the activities of ships when they move on the open sea using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas . even so susp@@ icious cycling routes can be discovered - such as indicating that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such tests can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly also if they have a criminal case .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the above @-@ mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which lost the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , imag@@ inary names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ seamless organised control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must not run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front is working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for fighting crimes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track the illegal ships that love to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO , who also deals with fishing data and offers technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that links various levels of information to each other . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i is intended to help to find criminal activities with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform jointly with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by the position of any track@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project allowing a global system to prosec@@ ute ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that previously had f@@ ished without a license and could hardly reck@@ on with consequences now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fisheries turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i helped Somalia to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there tow@@ ing nets where it was forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we can now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries have joined forces , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; With certainty , the goal is to make even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s most recent member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October , it presented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under a false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now prohibited .
the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters , which are reserved for Fischer from Somalia . &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they would go against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the world .

the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they act as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on the resolution , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into the void , in which they were gathered on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the recovery of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be held in other parts of the country , including in the low@@ lands of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition , in the res@@ ignation of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , saw the chance for a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the reluct@@ ance of re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine was the only way to give the country the chance to re@@ conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( e.g. : round@@ table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called on the demonstr@@ ators to join a mass rally in support of the National Assembly . in addition , a 12 @-@ hour strike on the Fol@@ der Day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , was scheduled to continue on 3 November .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3rd November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

on Twitter , pictures that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as repression and abuse reports .
especially large waves sm@@ ote the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to their own statement .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear any skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many nation@@ alities do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic shows the round , which is the extent of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the call for a formal authorisation procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .

others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government that has little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to refrain from cri@@ p@@ pling critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches tend to increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cór@@ doba .
as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testi@@ fies to his father in the course of the large La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cor@@ doba .
in the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of wearing the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was all right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer , and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano , was a gendar@@ mer@@ ist . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the secret service department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and urged me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP .
pass only that they don &apos;t take you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , a Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me that I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
on the military base I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

the prisoners are tortured &apos; there &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
the first and last time he was waiting for me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small gift wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were stopped and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I looked inside and saw a couch that people were tortured .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they put on the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been tied there .
they un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it up with water and drove him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .
photo : Com@@ isi@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that one person can do so much harm to another person ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and became eye @-@ band@@ ages .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ t quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were referred to as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed a man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to statements by survivors , the civilian Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you will see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be laid .
this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War loo@@ t &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at that time I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boot@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was in the military later - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that one takes away an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the head of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who steal cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , hit me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , I &apos;ll find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ f pul@@ lover made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to say .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and recognis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why kid@@ nap children ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could have been put into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act that one can do to a person .
my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they picked up machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something remains always .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the idea of showing my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made accus@@ ations about all the atro@@ cities that I had to witness with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me to take part in it as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
in 2010 I made the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can repro@@ ach me for being prejudi@@ ced . I have finally spoken against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death row in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

the judgments in the &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the sentence in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 persons guilty of crimes against humanity were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases imprisonment of sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were free sp@@ ells .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silence chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human heads .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for the victims for years on justice .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of men who were murdered or van@@ ished during the dictatorship , said :
the process lasted more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; translation error makes older people in Kyoto a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful car driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , last month witnesses of a very mis@@ successful translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was mistakenly translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building by September 1 @-@ 20 .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in social media .
the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the post @-@ Kyoto daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incorrect English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ tness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News addressed something more extensively with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , which are involved in accidents across the country , is quite an occasion for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the so @-@ called re@@ porter brought comments to the light on Yahoo &apos;s published version of the article , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ w against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on translation errors , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How defective is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of native English speakers that learn Japanese .
however , some companies that do not have foreign employees can make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and enig@@ matic sentences that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest British form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags are used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large companies or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; portal ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they would not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups who oppose the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was gro@@ ping and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : enable your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites were once again blocked by Venezu@@ el@@ an providers .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they would continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it &apos;s amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly tran@@ sm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond incor@@ rectly to specific domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server will respond incor@@ rectly or refuses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNS block : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ v@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transfer was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was det@@ ained .
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : it makes it difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina struggles for the rights of children and ga@@ thers witness testim@@ onies of other crimes that have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a cur@@ tural report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( Flying C@@ ows , Fall Schools ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride at her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , one calls in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money out@@ ages their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , an apprenticeship and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay countless days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that you cannot lift up .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated to Cri@@ adi@@ tas is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family who has their daughter in the belief that she will complete her training , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out &quot; can be handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl with her and justi@@ fies her exploitation by faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only experience it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of severe pun@@ ches . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the home of the former military officer Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town located 250 kilometres east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra arrived on a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered death injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered for protests and demanded that there will be no more Carolina in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ins .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a prompt investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the fall of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be directional - for the first time in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an history a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is in court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to sign up and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to divide the time so that she was still time to learn .
she rose up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
Fri@@ days , for example , clean@@ sed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and infected the floor .
when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she finished learning , the more leisure she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could fetch more books from the master &apos;s library than food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings , the house@@ keeper Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition papers like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; he kept them intelli@@ gently but did not enter@@ tain with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their masters feared that they would lose the education they gave to her , she explains .
but she was perfectly clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
in the school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken is bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to my home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .

society Ap@@ proves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and child ma@@ ids in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please register .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ an@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ an@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third commentary was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the ph@@ eas@@ ants of the ad switched off again :
dear friends , I found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paragu@@ ays ) , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of the Guaran@@ i and had to pay tribute to Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination .
the social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill calls for Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up in order to grant citizens a permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their proper names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money .
the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose their registration to the users . it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on the level of social media enterprises .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul S@@ att@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Ministry of Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it has not been known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German ) at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly of the technical capacities and the understanding of any agency in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal action against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison term was intended for those who are found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to resort to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish natural conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian leop@@ ard in Iraq designated by war

high up in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the north east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of leop@@ ards , which strike through Africa and Asia , are among the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , it is between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a qualified bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately demonstrates a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programmes from Nature Iraq for six years .
it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an Region .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , has documented the progress that has been achieved in the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture has been a form@@ id@@ able pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring coun@@ t@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map .
in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident , even so alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , which progress has been reached for six years to rebuild the local life .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building and survey results of the affected themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare @-@ houses were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
nevertheless , even six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated by accommodation shel@@ ters ( Santa Claus , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) could be reloc@@ ated to final replacement houses .
after the triple catastrophe almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes .
nearly 40 percent of those ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in this respect . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation that came after the disaster in accommodation shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , it is clear that industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of arable land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5,@@ 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma stays far away .
the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent here .
but the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation . she asked her about the status of re@@ building and also how her emp@@ athy has changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took action to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ eyed find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done .
how it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness to the worst , disa@@ strous , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience .
almost 63 000 people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23@@ ,000 people were reloc@@ ated to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent surro@@ gates .
after 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma must compete with massive building projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often real@@ ises that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global links are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode from In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ita explains how the love of music prevailed during a trip in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . release with permission .
rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer took him to the head of a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors operated on him on Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident of the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the whole oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel by media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly thereafter .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian rel@@ ays ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; against police violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the drawing was shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , only to crimin@@ alize the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the Military Police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group joined , only to crimin@@ alize teachers . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a stick in the face .
police interference
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil that last Friday came to brutal police missions against demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers deployed rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators erected a stage for speakers .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) asked the police to abst@@ ain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loud@@ speakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media has tu@@ cked street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting a broken glass window to illustrate with a photo their titles illustr@@ atively .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a fire @-@ set bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if you are strictly against any form of property damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is also an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
villages forgotten by de @-@ indu@@ str@@ alisation in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Al@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular commun@@ e Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvesting on site .
it was two years ago when activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its installations until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves anew .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ its daily to the factories which are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a veter@@ an veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region that are in operation after a long in@@ active period of time , because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members the fact that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already imp@@ acted the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the congregation saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ arable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories which could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will go into history with certainty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban president F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the de@@ commissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repeated the most , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
nearly all inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be obtained , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents that differ@@ ed only in terms of the parts that would be removed , addressing the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was transferred and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , awaits the retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ mounted one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important counter@@ f@@ us@@ sion@@ ist was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to the work places and services that the plants were generating in the communities where they were located .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the President of that time saw in the eyes of the present persons when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to dic@@ tate , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ate the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other factories .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without prospects of the future , many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production does not even serve to supply the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies they told him .
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
N@@ ene is about 65 years old in retirement , not because he lacks power , but because he is bitter .

first Nations youths use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been teaching mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop is thus increasing , that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youths are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a road section in western Canada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation .
many of the songs were published in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly by the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a drop in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I &apos;m trying to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will lose our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and move forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they intended the Creator
in the comments section , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and adds the St@@ rop@@ he to Sil@@ en@@ schrift ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( for the rest of the world ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; Plastic models of the courts &quot; ) of any food served in this restaurant .
customers see themselves in these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ oter district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a multitude of these small businesses that produce just those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend today turns them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
with Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new hand@@ held bands decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have become cem@@ ented collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in ess@@ ences is becoming more and more complex .
in this case , an Em@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice dish containing seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the Tokyo Train Station .
and here is an apple holding your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phone racks and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case ic@@ ura or salmon che@@ ated , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , Ear@@ rings and Hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .
further whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry . as for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports in domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reporting on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident nobody looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug trafficking &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and car@@ tels .
Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project so :
organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who searches for secret graves every weekend according to his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today for the task which we have set ourselves to seek , and search for graves , to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 , he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment , it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editors of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain why the project is so important : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , fragi@@ lity and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been acquainted with illness and sensation journ@@ alism for several years now .
every day I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the pages with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or experts from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is opposed or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different to this or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ tim@@ el@@ essness of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family was lo@@ oted with threats . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals spend money from their business month for month until they had torn apart not only the business , but also torn their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never goes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again if you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will be kidn@@ apped or killed .
in these terrible days I asked if tears would dissolve my rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation signed by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , bake potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every age .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years past when he was only a few blocks away from his home , saw the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the prosecution numbered 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data whose goal is to represent the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades in an understandable way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand in@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages to which he links , contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or revealing a fake .
but how is the years after something has emerged the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to exist further .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , one of the t@@ ank@@ ers fell victim to it .
representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a movie theater near , which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
a picture titled &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5. Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ coal bodies , which are lined up on the floor while people look at it .
but here the story doesn &apos;t end its end .
over the years , the same photograph has been imposed several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported drastically about atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
reports were reported , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to number cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be visu@@ alised on the basis of satellite images .
the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments on Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ si@@ fy the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments .
the picture taken from S@@ ange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning report , published by the United Nations , those who escaped could flee blows , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared as the following which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , fal@@ sely claiming that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an Being had said that monks and politicians were involved in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , had wrong@@ ly attributed this statement , but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false cros@@ spo@@ ints date back to 2011 and 2012 , and indeed come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ tin found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ ine@@ ated examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of which side they were published . thus , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been linked to one another ) several examples may be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use .
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
examples of false representations of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers , where examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports are still available .
the Gra@@ y countries are examples of the metadata and information available via Tin@@ tin , probably also for@@ gery examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in Blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City uses not only the ho@@ ax , but also discusses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .

in this article about explo@@ sions in North Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the site .
La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca quotes as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( not known if the original report contains the image ) .
France , 2015 .
Twitter reports after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am as this one that used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this .

Iran , 2012 .
an association of the@@ ology students in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims through the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the picture of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of the Old Town district P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o von Tren@@ to posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo taken from the DR Congo as a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o was shared in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of impro@@ per use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , to deli@@ mit , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a judgment on what to do as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purpos@@ eful news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with respect to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this ruling , which is exclusively published in English , also includes references to fake pictures of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech conduct and uses extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; paci@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? &quot;
this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news @-@ page fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein cleared up in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and , at the time of this publication , the picture is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students , who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , released from the now deleted , the Catholic located news site An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims it is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was subsequently circul@@ ating in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ u@@ y@@ or@@ dung &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo appeared with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay a greater attention to these events , presum@@ ed in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message supposedly circul@@ ated by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be ho@@ ax .
from the embassy in which the picture was taken from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine missionaries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ tin also points out , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and sometimes they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original piece of 2010 , the picture may ultimately bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong issues or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ scored in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images .
with social media , there are tens of thousands of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share their share of drinking water around a tragedy .
suggests this sen@@ timent of false and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of violent paintings has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and spectators and they take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study which investigated how violent media are working to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used from the context or in a totally ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , each examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT @-@ cla@@ ve language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Pain@@ t your parents in recognition of how to deal with you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ y other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are greatly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite wine here .

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ews the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ d@@ water and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ gel@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to a statement by the disaster centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missing because of floods and slu@@ dge .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were transported to 304 safe locations .
the ra@@ inf@@ all left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene practices of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the floo@@ ding catastrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever , Save the Children , after further rain@@ falls are already on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded because of the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five were made ready for transporting emergency supplies for the residents enclosed in their flooded villages .
various organisations and startups have also been preparing to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ pi@@ ana .
please call today the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this area need help .
the Tax@@ ear@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ up ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ up introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button allowing users to call a vehicle for picking assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flood and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exhausted , bring residents in need of security and provide relief measures .
this prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March is held in San Francisco on January 21 , 2017 .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
I trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts in me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we call still slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , we vote on trans@@ gender rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , tied up from an American flag , other channels slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hostili@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not a Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their conception .
they ab@@ dic@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all placed into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who as I do not fit in there , will become Muslim .
to be reli@@ eved of the muscles
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come into my mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and the Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western idea , the religion of Rum@@ i was extingu@@ ished , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ at@@ tered the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them .
I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA in 2016 could not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this narrative fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has taken our collective imagination so deep and fla@@ wed that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to record the narrative of the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America in the highest degree . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the total Muslim population is African @-@ speaking Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan re@@ thought about the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were ru@@ inous Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I &apos;m kid@@ ding , we don &apos;t wear all the bags with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of emin@@ ent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread fal@@ seh@@ oods about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing tape by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for counter@@ f@@ eit information that our already fla@@ wed image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , have manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head@@ sc@@ arf .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they return to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging .
my Muslim belief and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am a Muslim , if she could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ritual ritual with my daughter when I was silent in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arabic verses to the protection that seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow .

approved use .
belonging is the image of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters ; as they won a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
it is the image of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her finished and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi sa@@ i ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be a Muslim means to speak the prayers that she told me to speak when I have a bad day .
to be a Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , which means God , my only Lord .
for a people who - for centuries - was colon@@ ized by an &quot; Empire , &quot; which established a company with the name Ven@@ erable British East Line Company , it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
belonging is to grow up and to hear that men do not cry but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an insisted upon his family in India dominated K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close in his arms in half a century .
belonging to it is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at stake .
to be a Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it is to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped from a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir Unter@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were air@@ planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it is to remind that more than fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to hunt weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy catches the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slaves .
it is to know that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple d@@ ashes , but fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to take care of my child and to er@@ ect all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect structural anti @-@ Islam hostili@@ ty .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officials , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from just the countries that are bombar@@ ding it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs that we throw down to Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply involved to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous visual prints that we keep in mind in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increasingly print Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this gives me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are in .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group growing expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
it had not yet been given them a few years before ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who made me an un@@ bound Muslim today .
things I have left here like a bread cro@@ oked track in my speech .
things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity constitutes , a story may lie l@@ ur@@ king where one is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations in the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia are held .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not the terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars and people were enth@@ r@@ alled by the work of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , was even more scientific the Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president to eat chocolate cake while he already explo@@ ded broken lands and &quot; to other man @-@ made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
stories of stories , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project the following applies :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to make sense to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers first present their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story @-@ t@@ eller , their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience insi@@ sts on it .
they call forth laughter and emotion , as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional Burkina Faso story , which is told in the language Daf@@ ings . during this round , the story nar@@ rator R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ ara ara tells the f@@ able of the rab@@ bits and the bab@@ oon in the Sh@@ ona language from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ amus@@ ingly asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to talk to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend it . those who are inspired by the project can come into contact with T@@ LS to organize their own story @-@ stories .
Puerto Rico calls for re @-@ establishment of public debt from the US
with the aim of re@@ vis@@ ing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march started at the Capit@@ ol &apos;s Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ischen church assembly Puerto Rico .
the du@@ bbing of debt has also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico ur@@ ges that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for debts must be held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management board without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed remun@@ eration corresponding to our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the sovereign territory of the USA - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without a party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on public responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , measures imposed on the outside will run away from the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration wore the name &quot; Night vi@@ gi@@ l for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture that is organised in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ce de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director at Book S@@ prints , a publisher of books produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; produced within three to five days , read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Survey ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available in roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction , it says :
this book would like to discuss how moti@@ ons for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with this .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who participate in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to make some sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra jail in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or location .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book titled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push@@ es him to release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra jail , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police &quot; took Bass@@ el on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tribunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 , she was contacted by individuals who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his residence and state remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Markus , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that Bass@@ el founded , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ el &apos;s cultural prototypes was more man@@ a@@ geable than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the junction of numerous civi@@ lis@@ ations and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began working , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this campaign in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el was unable to complete this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life to dream of freedom and bass taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ uch that she wrote to her husband in 2012 @-@ 2015 when he was in jail .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she smu@@ ggles the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available without license .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It Is Happ@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind at the moment we embrace ,
that each of the dangers does not matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the prison rush
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile over your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
a year flies , my soul
during the rest of the year
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ el &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or van@@ ished by the regime were tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this last time .
Mozambique : director of corruption sentenced to release again on previous post
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger against a corruption incident where a government member returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his prison sentence in which corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defend@@ ants for disper@@ sion of 54 million euros ( around 800 000 euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose Council ruled Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
in 2016 , Cam@@ ba@@ za was released due to good leadership and immediately called for his re@@ position to the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office of the Republic , which rejected the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old posts , as the firm did not undertake disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well .
the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and under@@ scores the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have initiated disciplinary proceedings against the re@@ acting .
the company apparently kept silent and made no reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the social media of Mozambique , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had gone down .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
ref@@ using !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing mor@@ als and serving the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served himself in the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , not only to be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , overl@@ apping and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaking or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of selling also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is at the same time crimin@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he was 10 years old and released .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or split@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East India origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ ject con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt about their use were cens@@ ored .
furthermore , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with different mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , stool is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ alter@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to relieve his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to racial expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before eradic@@ ating all posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is carefully insp@@ ect the mail and check it by checking the words next door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( split@@ ting ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech have received a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who distribute hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that cens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will simply begin to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word in order to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned by the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from le@@ aking , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post was &quot; not consistent with the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they only have some more respect for the 15 million benefits that give them a big turnover , it would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and don &apos;t consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts which contained no hate language but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also inc@@ ite violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to control the balancing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it would have looked better on context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is finished with the marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a bill to ban this practice , so that the marriage @-@ ready age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the marriage , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities adher@@ ed to the practice , and in May 2016 there was a great public out@@ cry . at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , gathered that the state should not interfere as that , age did not determine the maturity . &quot;
this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors as , every man under 18 years of age . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and at 18 , it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical central office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements ende@@ a@@ vor@@ ing to aboli@@ sh laws of child@@ birth followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying the critic@@ isms of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite four Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , only the president of the country must agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and not a single one .
once it was decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws of child@@ birth were finally changed .
Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who is a minister of ministry in the ministry of education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that obsc@@ ured the essence of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law has been decided . &quot; &quot; &quot;
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! &quot;
follow Mut@@ ota , who is a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group which openly spoke about the importance of the adoption of the law :
the marriage @-@ bearing age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation of 18 years .
the draft on the amend@@ ment of the marriage committee was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs who have agreed to have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ bearing shiel@@ d@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hind@@ u organization .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed and he seems to deliver his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al Ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that can only cause panic and disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure , if we , instead of the problem , would invite the state to protect our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in advantage of them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step . however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia contents
the Wikipedia site in English was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured .
compiled by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series are fighting against the block@@ ade .
although many tech @-@ sealed Internet users are used to using b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , periodi@@ c block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid out all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alised peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer @-@ computer connections ) , which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
despite the legal ban , the content is available .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we heard the news ( about the locking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in store sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents in a decentr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , an error page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Le@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ or@@ pages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as collabor@@ ators at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
one acc@@ esses to a different URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server will guide the query to the correct Wikipedia site , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey .
because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that attract the attention of Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River a leop@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was located and I immediately started to gn@@ ash pictures ! !
S@@ ag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , because he stood face to face with Tig@@ ers :
a tiger cannot distur@@ b from the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he starts immediately , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , S@@ ag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re @-@ released as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women are concerned with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by a fake court from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer allow@@ ances to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , came to a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to de@@ mining the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as chil@@ dren@@ â s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected individuals , and leads these clubs .
she reports on how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion group was women who do not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify .
not saying al@@ oud to the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they all du@@ fully uph@@ eld and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on .
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in their luggage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everybody , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the names of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want it means that they do not respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the cr@@ ushing of a centuries @-@ old tradition where married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she was only kno@@ cking in front of herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to let out all the qu@@ ain@@ t fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in rush @-@ rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got scared and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ ken red dot on the forehead that shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zin@@ ken red dot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he did it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped bearing him .
the other women did not cease completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have never talked so frank@@ ly about some things , for example our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to tell certain things out loud , no matter how small they are .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they did not dare .
after a lot of arguments and discussions about the advantages of their own choice of clothing , mor@@ als combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round , so that women could carry them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they &apos;ll manage it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times but then stopped saying the name of her husband .
some , including me , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like the hag@@ gling around more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a hard @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we &apos;re talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on June 29th of this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post@@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed by the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review .

the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today , Beat@@ les Day is a day of commem@@ oration .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places that are related to the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , that is your 5 places you absolutely must visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )

exactly this year in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year as well .
and of course , some companies also use the fan base in the market , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could it be for a day ?

bald men are de@@ ported and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that men of bald men could be attacked in Mozambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald headed people for organic trade , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , is worried by the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
according to the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC declared .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in the South African country conducted a mission in order to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
respect for bald men who travel to Mozambique travel bald men in Mozambique are the aim of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Mozambique police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique said that the local police already follow the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for supposedly super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims had power in the head , generating wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blog &apos;s poor S@@ nai@@ ppa on Facebook who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ B Mozambique , TH@@ AT S@@ ME ashamed A country in which people would be ashamed to demand sex against good marks , work and other achievements , a nation in which people would rever@@ t decent jobs , or even take their lives to earn their bread , a land in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted that aim to get to fast riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police officer Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both bald are :

a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting of Arab blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ el &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by individuals who claimed themselves as the insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but did not give any further information .
Bas@@ el &apos;s stay and Constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a heard of Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of open web movement is an honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have been campaig@@ ning for his release over the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have van@@ ished , the Syrian Network for Human Rights organization .
countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 fewer than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody , such as the International Human Rights Organization Am@@ nesty International .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State endanger@@ ing ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokesperson said he did not consider it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to get calls from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow him or him to make a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations : United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Li@@ u a treatment abroad .
Norway - Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a stand@@ still after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China , as exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the European Union , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us as announced on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA ( USA )
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he helped him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on June 27 that the message asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy &apos;s call drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s declaration that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to intervene in isolated and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley said that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which it is entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system , as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government on it , release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release Nobel prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on July 7 and 8 .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns about whether the fuss about Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u attorney told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervis@@ es the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed Li@@ u to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um talks on :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release intervention per@@ missions for the exercise of these rights .
France - France
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an Declaration on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually absorb it .
Taiwan and Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of continental Affairs in Taiwan urged China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very worried about Li@@ u on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for his well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem foolish , as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ gos@@ ph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog of Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in view of it , he inevitably seemed un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears again from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , since it fits better to its power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he clo@@ aked the corresponding questions with non @-@ answers in a rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng requests Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
when Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point , provided he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points to the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the entire address of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam statements , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , why the Singapore elections were so un@@ balanced even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of an adol@@ escent generation makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what awaits me - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes he is correctly associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committed a mistake or was it a Freu@@ dian advocate ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered to be an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country will the sovereign rights of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is both country and city .
since he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of grave importance .
why do the Singap@@ or@@ ans do their military service , do they only defend their town but not their country ?
who has to pay back our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade to the Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tends to be a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country mainly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak about the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or homeland ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series dealing with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and showing another fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor of Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been living in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered poli@@ te to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
&quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook internally with anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind it .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that makes Canadi@@ ans different from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag easily visible on their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
everyone loves Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are poli@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously speak very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country facing ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me , for example , if one would conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be sk@@ e@@ worthy - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really were a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless is to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main feature of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau came on stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just cute .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells us what regulations his girlfriend does . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly politically , the music video refers indirectly to the prolonged military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 songs .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was even blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially how it beha@@ ves with the state of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video , which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the Army absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change of imagination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear provisions are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unity was established in the army which monitors online content and accused persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand sets a strict law against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ esty insul@@ t ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although safety experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video shows how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in jail , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened long imprisonment , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only slowly re@@ covers in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an war has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal bas@@ ins of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the majority of Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ho@@ stages .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ Ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people , having hardly asc@@ ended over a decade .
about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district in 1989 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early six@@ ties called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kov@@ ka symboli@@ se the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do we speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nonetheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens serving all of the community .
now there is only a paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty residents live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chen@@ ko , which still host one or two families , can be seen on the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence farming ( farming of agricultural products for personal use ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district administration delivers candles and bread to the villages free of charge .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
the monthly pension has just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden nor a house , it &apos;s very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that they and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a convers@@ ational partner Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , t@@ aps and chickens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , it lost its anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy runs over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones onto the deca@@ yed buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which are responsible for their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez heads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , tells Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
&quot; &quot; &quot; where are you Mama Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if M@@ om Africa was a proper nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ee beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel the distance together and that the Afri@@ cans speak already on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil earlier and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez nar@@ rates that her guests often send her text messages when she left to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family welcomed migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he began to help them get an adequate price , then he offered them his home for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others will not help . that &apos;s the reason I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to press money out of him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single person , offered him the roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , the travellers calm@@ ly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , she leaves with numerous photos in her album .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care whom she made a girl , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she puts it in a nut@@ shell .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats it every time .
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had exchanged news with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app .
in the communication of the police , the app was able to determine and track the sources and the distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their own home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; which was based on Twitter , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the residents random@@ ly to see if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you may be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
it also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which it emerges that the software can lift up the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government departments , authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a current report of Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ enses including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ leep and Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where all important things have disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth which is clearly identi@@ fiable , both internally and extern@@ ally .
a woman who gives honor to her name .
one that has precip@@ itated into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but if the reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts dissolve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the Earth is spinning on the A@@ xis of Un@@ hei@@ ls . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls , your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone and stone .
they have imprisoned me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough so that I &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts desired , only my own not .
for the first time , it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not make high demands on a city that is st@@ oned up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a bit cal@@ ming after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined together to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations fully and completely .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the spirit out of the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow down - nothing can give you back your voice , after you have scre@@ amed them all the way to the office of the Security Service .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me also hear how you write Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , or you are only courageous enough to sh@@ out if we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the smell of this cur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a psychological torture that I was exposed to for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office leading through a corridor to the individual cells .
I form@@ ulate all details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably have assigned me a larger cell .
I have to share it with only one single other prisoner and I am allowed to sit straight away without waiting for permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ time communication method : to strike with the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ aid &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently none of the surrounding cells lay in a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness no striking features can be recognized , and there are no doctors here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
maybe he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s out of the fruit of my head &apos;s garden . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries sound , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of spo@@ il@@ age until I saw the yellow light showing us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13th Sh@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : to protect the security of the state from us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played out their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their view of the world .
it is a curse that they call co@@ existence in order to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the interro@@ gation and meet at Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he happens to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than join you and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been used to not answering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can really no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I did nothing to earn this punishment .
of punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your hang@@ man will delight in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my cries weren &apos;t enough for him yet , so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them changed while I was still on the line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , which is why he was next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity went through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my semi @-@ naked body stretched out on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus mit dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted teen@@ ager : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fearful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and go away , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he fli@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and had forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village to Palestine where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and questions her old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the whole Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not constra@@ ined by boundaries in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special a@@ version against U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , to do something with his identity as the &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so much about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a human being &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while in water dissolved Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot jun@@ cture has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically speaking lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ vering of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you look into the neighbouring countries .
it is therefore easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual front singer Ham@@ ed sensu@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert cancellation .
the MP and former press spokesperson in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was canc@@ eled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the old @-@ time legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la expressed the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which still decided &quot; to use intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might not be simply sil@@ ky rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect a more and more clearly @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan that appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional sex men to Lei@@ be by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently laid @-@ down unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust .
over the past few years , the number of &apos; hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ als &apos; has increased in Jordan - un@@ official from the outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ our@@ able mur@@ ders reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law for comb@@ ating crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that long as tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate from politics his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics was in@@ ad@@ missible for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the nucle@@ us can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , one verse is quite often repeated :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it too . &quot;
in the course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can &quot; get what you want &quot; - whether belief or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality have been severely cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya , to later point out that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a processed version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b adverti@@ ses openly for the Arabic LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and holds the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ evo , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the Te@@ ach@@ ers Association , argu@@ ing that they were critical of the problems connected with the deep @-@ rooted corruption in social media .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how it looks like H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , reas@@ oned and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will embrace a real and fundamental openness by music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and artificial ways . at least he hopes that .
until it is so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ ula festival .
it is thought that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in many parts of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the for@@ ts , drums and dancing came across more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched into the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :

I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 @-@ meter @-@ high car was incredible .

external appearances and body care were seldom as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of crime and to promote a legitimate job as the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate , where traffic noise and illegal drug trafficking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing a growing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and hence the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more normal citizens to embar@@ k on the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks on how to watch in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair tools and to obtain training in bar@@ ber art instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and talked about some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only specialised school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled ?
exactly this question went out to the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la @-@ li@@ ación ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC gu@@ erri@@ lla movement , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was deemed so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , in front of the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their arms around the clock , now have to re@@ integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , once accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred for gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now enter into its ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ er@@ illa fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more unnecessary .
he plans to share his love with people that needed the most urgent response this year .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former com@@ bat@@ ants of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN stores in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo of the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally hand over the letters .
the F@@ ARC members stood up as they had done before , in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a sort of hut in which the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go in because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone wrote to me something so beautiful , so I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears came to me over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely , and sat down beside the gar@@ net .
perhaps he was tired of war , was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
at the beginning students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC had already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state exer@@ ted on the entire Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw as a monster and even hated even people with beautiful feelings , who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that peace would rule after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to resort to arms , to rise up and protest for their rights . and that is fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now focusing on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with terror activists witnessed the reporting of the last few months over the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not only emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that addressed the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of que@@ ens in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested susp@@ icious que@@ ens and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt she was actually a woman .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear for her life , she moved to the United States in the long run .
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer assistant in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents made the round with W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was there to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honour the family , you care ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up at the hospital in the last analysis .
apparently some women had got involved and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two bites in my right lung .
OC Media : in which nursing wings were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month at the hospital .
last February , I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some remote relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that it was all a lie .
they set absurd demands : some told me that I needed to prove it by running through the streets at the top ; others wanted me to appear in Gro@@ z@@ ny on official TV and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I have said on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to handle this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which has cor@@ rupted not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she laid a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 included .
after it happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was wrong .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I still can &apos;t grasp how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without regi@@ stering , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in safety just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
people know in which hotel you are hiding . you even know your room number .
just to prove to you : it &apos;s number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender balance , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo issue .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish it , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I am really struggling to see the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who inj@@ ected for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
with that , I mean , they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still det@@ ained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there wouldn &apos;t be too many .
if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face the Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they are held there so that one can present them as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television , claiming that they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were deliberately di@@ pped in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who imprisoned in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew up .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even involved when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , and there have been no reports yet . we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already well @-@ known when I was living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer then than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the end Russia wanted to bring us closer to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally dropped us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never even curved my hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da@@ ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped onto the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television about morality .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily on the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , you could feel the people in the city started to change .
those who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , gaz@@ ed at you at once with suspicion .
in that time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly worsen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you follow now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get the essenti@@ als .
I don &apos;t have a p@@ enny for that .
I have discovered these people myself when I cl@@ apped sanctuary .
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
nature has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to know you with foam before the mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders who have the Kab@@ ard@@ iner have which , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think at transition to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sens@@ ations in order to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong rise in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who wish to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
a video posted on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything anymore .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that several others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have appe@@ aled this month .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family @-@ fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work due to the persecution by the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power and in 1925 had undertaken great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable arable land for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of that wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arabic regions to the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish@@ - and palm @-@ industry industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ ks was now up to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , finished primary school , finished 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab states have to endure , human rights activists strike al@@ arms before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I am not identi@@ fiable by femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons license .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - respond with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I &apos;m suffering twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I speak on skin color , on racism , black women women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used under racism and discrimination , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists choose to remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school than white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I can not join a movement in whose center is the white woman who refuses to take into account injusti@@ ces in her mind , which relate to the sex as well as the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a simple and margin@@ alised being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups which also assimil@@ ate our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to expose white women to the importance of over@@ cutting of skin color and gender . because some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them a better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to det@@ ach myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so ob@@ st@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before , that we define black women to us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : recall that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored nor rejected .
p@@ addle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that has been specifically reported on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re @-@ published here .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled during the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern in the region of Kurdist@@ an in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development can lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ borne Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keepers Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multi @-@ media techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

the following article is the abri@@ dged and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # sof@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had been violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for ill treatment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez had no av@@ ail .
a few days later , the second wife retired .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , if women make an announcement at all , they generally receive no support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this explains why only 20 % of all women who admit that they are victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities at all .
cont@@ ent@@ s@@ 1 Be@@ atings and statistics 2 In@@ visible mal@@ treatment and a legal system that has nothing unter@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation pun@@ ches and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a research institute in Paraguay .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads were reported to the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the police &apos;s ads came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here too .
in the adver@@ ts , 40 % of women reported that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman , which is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for mental abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not have to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
only until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died because of violence by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but she gave up . this should repent her for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psych@@ ic force - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long from Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay almost eight years to prove that her former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ tori@@ a &apos;s case everything began with mental abuse .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Vic@@ tori@@ as advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an imper@@ me@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but are not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # for you ) .
this h@@ ash tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ er to an independent perpet@@ rator and to punish harder as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
in this way , the law text has been modified in some respects , in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and is pun@@ ishable by up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill envis@@ ages the bulk of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which must bear the victims of violence themselves at the present time , if they simply want to refund and receive a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ thinking must take place here so that violence is no longer seen as something normal .
those who are silent in the face of these facts complic@@ ate themselves and contribute to the fact that the perpetrators get away offen@@ sively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must submit such a long notification until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been altered . among other things , parts of the law had been altered .
opinions about the changes are dealt with .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is , however , considered a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman to continue attacks one year after ban of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is published on the website of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Korean authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he served a year @-@ old prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having ab@@ dic@@ ated his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , along with his role as the only sul@@ tan , he is one of the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of the sul@@ tan is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the secret service , the public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , and torture of human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ dating and det@@ ain@@ ing .
the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , concluded that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties tie the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on Justice of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a ruling in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the editorial board , was invited to the special department from the ISS and was arrested by the security forces at his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS accepted Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; publishing and spreading the newspaper on any way , including online , is prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ kat took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the court condemned the three journalists to prison and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned , among other things , for dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ gra@@ dation of the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a publication ban and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 Euros in each case ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit of $ 5000 was fixed ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the pron@@ oun@@ cement of the sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court pronounced Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i free in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the extra@@ dition of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served to serve his one year sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Appe@@ al also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister presented himself once more to the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to allow the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman recently .
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper , to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the om@@ anic authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j will release immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protecting the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their ri@@ ghtful human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial sch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighboring countries through the promotion of freedom of opinion and association and the right to gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research conducted on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and the lack of investment for research into these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a big problem .
secondly , research conducted by African scientists can help build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he scre@@ ened himself on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ bian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : currently the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the S@@ á@@ mi national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently developing a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think are the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only focus on solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain a recipient instead of being a creator .
the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how large is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often , it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
the patents applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green colour or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants such as crop or car@@ ton varieties . based on these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition Mor@@ ton still breeds salad , but it takes longer because his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der is lying in a river to which I have to commu@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is very cau@@ tious and endeav@@ ours not to use any material protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the USA and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts at the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten Red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the Out@@ red@@ geous variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station , where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted software .
it has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they bred .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not to sow it immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
Professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of the seeds and the ability to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in greater cohesi@@ on such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultiv@@ ating seed with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; he says and takes care of the increasingly widespread mer@@ gers in the global agri@@ business , as it is offered for example on farmers markets , should also know that the way in which this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain freely available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool shr@@ inks inc@@ ess@@ antly due to increasing intellectual property rights to plant material that is becoming more and more limited .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found that about one third of all the car@@ rots are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be usable either at all or only ag@@ grav@@ ated .
there are no such estimates for other plants yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that large @-@ scale crops such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown in such a way that they have specific desired traits - from those that enhance their taste or colour to those that thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders decreases through more and more patents . at present genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before , as the changed conditions are much less predictable due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to maintaining biodiversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property restrictions other breeders because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result using another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection thus prevents innovation , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this differently : waiting 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers their job easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all , Mor@@ ton is bo@@ thering on the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety also breeds its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation large herds of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is meti@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding crop patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my grades myself in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy to think of . &quot; worldwide resonance
while the US seems to be a leader in Open Source breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the centre works with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organisation agreements co@@ l works on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to Bre@@ e@@ ders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be taken over to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Committee of the European Union , the European Commission , stated that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; it is now up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for seeds of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which the official starting signal should fall next year .
an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report . it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed policies , so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see him soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human Rights Organization and Blog are the newest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the above .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August has published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities strongly critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information persi@@ sts in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should actually defend the law , to def@@ y the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the barriers and not to give in . we insist on fulfilling our task further .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network of Qatar based on alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web site lock@@ ings to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer has access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he used to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government was even the goal of an attack .
the blo@@ gger , which is also home to Canada &apos;s blog , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the government and reflected what this meant for him :
to lock blo@@ gs is very old but has priority in the Er@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ Sis@@ i era ; and although the block of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey the feeling of a state of siege ; An arrest , a attempted murder , a sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs and any other website for which I was working .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
at first I used it to post items to b@@ ypass cens@@ orship .
but now , having locked him and that they &apos;re afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courageous walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the closure of providers , which was possible through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the closure of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offered began .
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content to which Egyptian users could have access .
in addition , the situation is worsen@@ ed by the fact that the decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed to court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers report in Brazil with glo@@ omy news from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , na@@ vy and air@@ tw@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the violence wave 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice called even the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published in Rio for detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city will be published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that as journalists we do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a martial art in a country that does not recognise the war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities by the police who only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues that violence is called a &quot; war . &quot; according to her opinion , this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to accoun@@ table those responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
in memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north @-@ east of the country according to statistics of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mor@@ dr@@ ates per state , Rio is on No@@ .@@ 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ ilia , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state for many years .
to these security policy measures , the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , aims to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police force and permanently station@@ ing one unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline of violent deaths . for several years , however , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under fire following several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people .
this calls for the state to use resources and ways that are typical of war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
one week it is now that the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loy@@ alist troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpet@@ rated by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus , causing inhabitants to rely on locally produced food or through tunnels and control points .
through years of block@@ ade traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , its nutritional value makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , spoke to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in homes and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years it has been struggling to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more promin@@ ence . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crowd funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
because of the shortage of fuel , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this was done , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom @-@ breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , car@@ ton , etc ) to produce new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will become apparent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21 in many capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that had ramp@@ ed up in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of the 15th and 16th October . this led to the government calling out a federal government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ ici@@ a region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European Forest Monitoring System , which monitors forest land by satellite ima@@ gery , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 , an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

numerous videos spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the predictable tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil defence was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão sovereign@@ s from the Government of Portugal &apos;s farmers declared the paper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the woods of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy could have happened again as in June , as the streets were locked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law allowing the construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us drew attention to the fact that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of slightly inflamm@@ able wood , are spreading , as in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind .
to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that supplied the population with information : it used fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt &apos;s own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not resist the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out among the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups defeated by the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair .
exactly at that time was A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say it that way back then she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ oo , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again .
for a few years , he worked in a coal pit . the work was difficult and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself , in order to earn his living .
back then like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site where we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were no services and no heating there . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we do not freeze at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af drove his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high welcome quot@@ as , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers have found in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the Human Rights Organization , Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe , writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be withdrawn for months following the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it took A@@ shar@@ af as well .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible tw@@ ins helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after having worked several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af disclosed his entire savings to the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - ein Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 people live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years a number of Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pad@@ ua , Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a Pizzeria in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian restaurant business and retail and aim back to the country it forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans along the way .
citizen report : dra@@ fts from Egypt allow shut @-@ down social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported about the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .
pictures of @ C@@ il@@ un@@ a@@ 27 are shared on Twitter .
global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen @-@ Report is an international sn@@ apshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that provides users with social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after regi@@ stering with a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to register in order to use social networks within six months of successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
if you miss this step , you may be sentenced to up to six months in prison or the final settlement of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was promoted by sixty members of parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another MP submitted a legislative proposal to introduce har@@ sh@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ ting of the president or a senior official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposition , however , such an act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ rir Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is in danger already for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who took photos on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protest@@ ants who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in prison for a court hearing .
recently , the trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree on the apparent strain of e.g. weapons , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza acqu@@ itted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si session block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ tor@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
listen to Tunisi@@ an activists on le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic who , according to the plan , endor@@ sed a controversial draft law that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused officers of am@@ nesty , provided they return all un@@ lawful mon@@ ies .
the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at casts a light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the designation of his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he witnessed in the case of the District Court in Tunis on May 09 .
does China want to force the users of social media to demonstrate their identity ?
according to new rules of the information bure@@ au of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media .
in the Reg@@ ulations it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that by doing so the elimination of anonymous comments is to be achieved within social networks . it is unclear until now how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed social media to sel@@ ectively enforce these regulations in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat missed to register with the state government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of the spread of information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force it on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ Classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to er@@ ase two articles in English , the indications that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to make a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ code data encryption .
however , the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has abandoned other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
