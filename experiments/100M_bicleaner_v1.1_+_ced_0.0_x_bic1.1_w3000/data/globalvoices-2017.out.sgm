<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the age of 14, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who with the help of Julia Roberts as a law student covered the murderous plot of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I've been like this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain as it is said so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican preselection was the highest number ever achieved by a candidate nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "also, Trumpet Weltanschauung agreed not to agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still adapts to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values incarnated by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump broke his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom know, have voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that they have disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (NB. Ü): as much as "rebellion of the whites against all other ethnicities," wordplay made of white in reference to the white and whiplash, which means as much as whirling injuries, as the great Van Jones described, has killed exactly what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America is welcome everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of an Kenyanean, whose story, as he says himself, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, a huge portion of the white America promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "do Latinos have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices cried louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, it is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this is my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican Music School of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular with tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La banda de Música (music band) plays in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest to the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its drug abuse and banal violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members are very serious about their obligations to the music group, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always play laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments composed of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the Recycler led by Favio Chávez to turn parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, contrabass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateura, recalls the initial period:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in trash The children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio had shown something he had never seen before: a violin made out of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments of re-prepared material and called The Recycled Orchestra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world produces about one billion tons of trash.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "follows the orchestra with his inspirational play of trash-to-music around the world." ""</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully tackle illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at the time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Liberian waters before the other coast of Africa was seeking.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal offender of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to dock one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries which simply refused everything" "", "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that the ship discovered and pursued at the time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it did not succeed in catching fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of fish stocks in the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries who then expelled the premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing" "", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is trapped is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate failure of existing laws to protect certain habitats and species can damage the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the slug empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are happening these days in real time, with trackable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also very attentively pursues the activities of ships when they move on the open sea using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas. even so suspicious cycling routes can be discovered - such as indicating that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such tests can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the go and possibly also if they have a criminal case.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The above-mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which lost the eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, imaginary names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-seamless organised control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You must not run my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for fighting crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track the illegal ships that love to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO, who also deals with fishing data and offers technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that links various levels of information to each other. FISH-i is intended to help to find criminal activities with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform jointly with Google and the Marine Protection Organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by the position of any trackable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project allowing a global system to prosecute ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously had fished without a license and could hardly reckon with consequences now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fisheries turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i helped Somalia to track down Greko 1, the inspectors found there towing nets where it was forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we can now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined forces, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With certainty, the goal is to make even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's most recent member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October, it presented Greko 1, a ship under a false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used towing nets which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also invaded into forbidden waters, which are reserved for Fischer from Somalia. "by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they would go against illegal fishing," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the world.

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They act as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on the resolution, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into the void, in which they were gathered on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the recovery of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be held in other parts of the country, including in the lowlands of Barinas, in the Andes regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the central north federal state of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation deteriorates continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition, in the resignation of the current president Nicolás Maduro, saw the chance for a fundamental change; in the end, however, the reluctance of re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine was the only way to give the country the chance to reconquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (e.g.: roundtable of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, called on the demonstrators to join a mass rally in support of the National Assembly. in addition, a 12-hour strike on the Folder Day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, was scheduled to continue on 3 November.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3rd November all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral, in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government according to their own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andean State Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear any skirts, because otherwise you could see something that many nationalities do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic shows the round, which is the extent of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the call for a formal authorisation procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a grown-up man, Quijano now testifies to his father in the course of the large La Perla-Ribera trial in the province of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial concluded on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of wearing the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not see that my father was a thief, torturer, and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father, Luis Alberto Quijano, was a gendarmerist. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the secret service department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijano's son, a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atrocities he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and urged me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have been friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they don't take you one day and I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, a Revolutionary People's Army - the Military Arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me that I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">The prisoners are tortured 'there'</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla with - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">The first and last time he was waiting for me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - simply everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small gift wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were stopped and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I looked inside and saw a couch that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they put on the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been tied there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They unleashed a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it up with water and drove him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: Comisión Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The stench there was appalling... like a dirty winch.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that one person can do so much harm to another person?</seg>
<seg id="248">'i knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and became eye-bandages.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Near the entrance, people crout quietly on the mattresses.</seg>

<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me about it at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra there were some rooms that were referred to as offices.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be laid.</seg>

<seg id="288">At that time, the defense accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can put me to the burden of what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building by September 1-20.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Levine, widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a citizen of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The post-Kyoto daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves nobody has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The incorrect English translation was initially removed. the name "terrible drivers" was later replaced by the more appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct term "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely regret that elderly people felt insulted by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News addressed something more extensively with the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers, which are involved in accidents across the country, is quite an occasion for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of native English speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">However, some companies that do not have foreign employees can make translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sentences that arise through mechanical translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest British formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints that often decorate t-shirts or bags are used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large companies or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censorship measures on the internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the "Navegar con Libertad" portal (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they would not have access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups who oppose the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was groping and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: enable your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites were once again blocked by Venezuelan providers.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they would continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It's amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, revealed that local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond incorrectly to specific domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server will respond incorrectly or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS block: @ elcapitoliotv, @ vPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third blocked channel, the transfer was stopped on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also been reported that the government regulates internet connections: it makes it difficult for Venezuelans to access multimedia coverage of the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="414">Today, Tina struggles for the rights of children and gathers witness testimonies of other crimes that have been victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="415">Photo by Cecilia Rojas. use with kind permission of curtural.</seg>
<seg id="416">The following article is the abridged version of a curtural report published by Global Voices with kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" (Flying Cows, Fall Schools), edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation from the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride at her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "she said," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, one calls in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money outages their underage son or their underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay countless days of housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that you cannot lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated to Criaditas is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family who has their daughter in the belief that she will complete her training, improve their position in society and "make something out" can be handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes up the girl with her and justifies her exploitation by faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education, and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will only experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the previously unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in the Paraguayan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of severe punches. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the home of the former military officer Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town located 250 kilometres east of the capital of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira arrived on a stick to Marín until she suffered death injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered for protests and demanded that there will be no more Carolina in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complains.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a prompt investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the fall of Carolina Marín could be directional - for the first time in the Paraguayan history a case of Criadazgo is in court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as labor force, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to sign up and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>

<seg id="464">When the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="503">"" "" "" "if it is adopted by Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a place would be set up in order to grant citizens a permission to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register on the site of the site with their proper names and ID numbers to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose their registration to the users. it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation on the level of social media enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the Ministry of Telecommunications to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall at national level around Facebook. because of those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not been known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German) at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strongly of the technical capacities and the understanding of any agency in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a trial.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be passed as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft "stands in accordance with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximised and that no deviating narration is present on the image surface," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the MP Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a legal action against cyber crime in which a life-long prison term was intended for those who are found guilty of threatening "public order" and "to resort to protest."</seg>

<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which strike through Africa and Asia, are among the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus Saxicolor). altogether, it is between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they find less and less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator is present." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still the region is busy rebuilding.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, has documented the progress that has been achieved in the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture has been a formidable prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring countectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, as the tsunami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, Fukushima Prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, even so alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, which progress has been reached for six years to rebuild the local life.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding and survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare-houses were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi recorded the greatest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, even six years after the disaster, evacuated by accommodation shelters (Santa Claus, kasetsu juutaku) could be relocated to final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of those evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful in this respect. more than 75 percent of the evacuation that came after the disaster in accommodation shelters were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, it is clear that industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5,400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima lie in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima stays far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The number of tourists in Miyagi and Iwate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">But the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine an overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation. she asked her about the status of rebuilding and also how her empathy has changed vis-à-vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took action to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture Fukushima was also witness to the worst, disastrous, nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people from Fukushima were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23,000 people were relocated to Fukushima, in permanent surrogates.</seg>
<seg id="580">After 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes, most of the evacuation centres are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima must compete with massive building projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries speaking another language, the differences seem to be larger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often realises that one more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global links are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode from Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at these global links. in our Into the Deep podcast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherita explains how the love of music prevailed during a trip in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Act of Alvaro Reynoso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular commune Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvesting on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when activities were paralyzed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its installations until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves anew.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commits daily to the factories which are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a veteran veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 o'clock in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region that are in operation after a long inactive period of time, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers the fact that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already impacted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are not news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the congregation saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report" "" "Agricultural perspectives" "" "published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization." ""</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will go into history with certainty," "" "these were the first words of Cuban president Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the decommissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, is the word he repeated the most, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Nearly all interviewees are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be obtained, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents that differed only in terms of the parts that would be removed, addressing the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was transferred and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, awaits the retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismounted one of his 31 working years.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been teaching mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop is thus increasing, that the young participants explore topics such as" "" "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptance" "" "or whatever comes to mind." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youths are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tears," a road section in western Canada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs were published in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly by the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a drop in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will lose our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and move forward as well as our youth</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru ("Plastic models of the courts") of any food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see themselves in these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokioter district of Kappabashi, there are a multitude of these small businesses that produce just those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend today turns them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">With Naver matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new handheld bands decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have become cemented collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essences is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an Emen-don (a popular rice dish containing seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the Tokyo Train Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple holding your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone racks and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case icura or salmon cheated, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon roe?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), Earrings and Handybands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further whimsical plastic dishes can be found at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # 1.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry. as for example with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports in domestic and foreign media on the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drugs bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa Cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident nobody looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "live with drug trafficking") that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="759">"" "a video entitled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how afraid life changes" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for secret graves every weekend according to his son.</seg>

<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been acquainted with illness and sensation journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I pass newspaper kiosks and see the pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or experts from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is opposed or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to this or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "the intimelessness of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "soaked." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared by such tragedies when they are not stirred and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of blackmail in the main city district: how a family was looted with threats." in this she describes how armed criminals spend money from their business month for month until they had torn apart not only the business, but also torn their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never goes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will be kidnapped or killed.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked if tears would dissolve my rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation signed by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, bake potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every age.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years past when he was only a few blocks away from his home, saw the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Security and Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecution numbered 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"" "in addition to the project" "" "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" "", "Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata whose goal is to represent the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades in an understandable way."

<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures on news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, one of the tankers fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Representatives of the authorities described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a movie theater near, which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to unrecognizability.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture titled "That is Nigeria." from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015. Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charcoal bodies, which are lined up on the floor while people look at it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story doesn't end its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photograph has been imposed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically about atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">Reports were reported, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed behind to number corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be visualised on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this improper use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments on Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely falsify the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture taken from Sange also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of Rohingya Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning report, published by the United Nations, those who escaped could flee blows, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared as the following which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, falsely claiming that President Myanmar's Than Being had said that monks and politicians were involved in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="901">Malaysia, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="902">Malaysia offers two extreme examples of improper use of the image from the DR Congo, on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nigerian massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blogger, the claims that Rohingya are persecuted, to delimit, since the photos were misused.</seg>

<seg id="905">This ruling, which is exclusively published in English, also includes references to fake pictures of rumors that Hate Speech conduct and uses extremist groups to show that Muslims kill Buddhists and vice versa (which is often spread by Burmese nationalists).</seg>
<seg id="906">Russia, 2012. "paciophobia or political provocation?"</seg>
<seg id="907">This post, which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox Church, clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news-page falsely claimed that the president of Myanmar Thein cleared up in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and, at the time of this publication, the picture is still included in it.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students, who had been killed by Boko Haram, released from the now deleted, the Catholic located news site Análisis Digital, has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the killings, but it claims it is a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture was subsequently circulating in connection with the Boko Haram massacre in 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute that there were links to Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo appeared with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted their communities to pay a greater attention to these events, presumed in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times). but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Portuguese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message supposedly circulated by a "father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnamese and declared it to be hoax.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the embassy in which the picture was taken from the DR Congo, the organisation of the Claretine missionaries and Fr. Juan Carlos Martos distanced themselves.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">In other accounts, aggregators and sites in the following countries (on the portfolio in grey), Tintin also points out, but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the crawler and sometimes they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original piece of 2010, the picture may ultimately bear a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong issues or frames (framing) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underscored in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of thousands of people who inadvertently share their share of drinking water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this sentiment of false and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent paintings has already been extensively debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitizing readers and spectators and they take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study which investigated how violent media are working to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used from the context or in a totally abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons uses CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. irreplaceable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese acid) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the VAT-clave language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Paint your parents in recognition of how to deal with you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after being warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defy other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the Treasure Languages, which are greatly appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite wine here.</seg>

<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where, however, Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars and people were enthralled by the work of the "other" in the public presentation, was even more scientific the Stanford four decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this, consciously and unconsciously to solidify the "other." as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we have no president to eat chocolate cake while he already exploded broken lands and "to other man-made" people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Stories of stories, by Flickr-user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening is often associated with understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listening" "" "instead" "" "listening to make sense to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers first present their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story-teller, their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience insists on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotion, as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional Burkina Faso story, which is told in the language Dafings. during this round, the story narrator Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamara ara tells the fable of the rabbits and the baboon in the Shona language from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamusingly asks:" "" "how is it to talk to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a wide grin he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend it. those who are inspired by the project can come into contact with TLS to organize their own story-stories.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for re-establishment of public debt from the US</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of revising the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the march started at the Capitol's Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizens front for the neural examination of debts) and the Ökomenischen church assembly Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The dubbing of debt has also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>

<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and suppressed.</seg>

<seg id="1167">Therefore, the so-called "Center for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organization without a party affiliation with a focus on socio-economic development, proposes a law on public responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture that is organised in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulce de Rosnay, a scientist of the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director at Book Sprints, a publisher of books produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' produced within three to five days, read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Survey).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available in royalty-free, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how motions for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with this.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who participate in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to make some sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra jail in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its current state or location.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book titled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes him to release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra jail, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police" took Bassel on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military tribunal from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015, she was contacted by individuals who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his residence and state remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Markus, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that Bassel founded, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basel's cultural prototypes was more manageable than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the junction of numerous civilisations and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This campaign in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel was unable to complete this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life to dream of freedom and bass taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prosabuch that she wrote to her husband in 2012-2015 when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggles the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1250">By 2016, according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in prison since 2011.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"" "" "" "Mozambique reacted with anger against a corruption incident where a government member returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his prison sentence in which corruption was committed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants for dispersion of 54 million euros (around 800 000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose Council ruled Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">In 2016, Cambaza was released due to good leadership and immediately called for his reposition to the company, which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General's Office of the Republic, which rejected the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to resume his old posts, as the firm did not undertake disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and underscores the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have initiated disciplinary proceedings against the reacting.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently kept silent and made no reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the social media of Mozambique, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "rebellious" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had gone down.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Refusing!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing morals and serving the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served himself in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeút prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is in prison:</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East India origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely abject connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt about their use were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several burmesan words with different meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, stool is written on Burmesan also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spalterbse), 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to relieve his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the sentence ku la -" "" "healing" "" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - is very similar to racial expression, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before eradicating all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is carefully inspect the mail and check it by checking the words next door.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar pae" "" "(splitting)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech have received a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who distribute hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that censorship is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will simply begin to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word in order to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from leaking, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post was "not consistent with the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only have some more respect for the 15 million benefits that give them a big turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and don't consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts which contained no hate language but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>

<seg id="1346">This happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children's Rights, the minors as, every man under 18 years of age. "</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and at 18, it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the statistical central office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married to 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements endeavoring to abolish laws of childbirth followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about saying the criticisms of the children's marriage, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite four Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now, only the president of the country must agree and declare the law." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for this and not a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Once it was decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws of childbirth were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a minister of ministry in the ministry of education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that obscured the essence of the matter, but do you know what? the toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to abolish practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the country's most famous Hindu organization.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj has announced his intention to take legal action, the law should be passed and he seems to deliver his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al Rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate if Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so generally, in a way that can only cause panic and displeasure, if we, instead of the problem, would invite the state to protect our daughters from being abused by large, hard-boiled men who are in advantage of them, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not, this legislation is an important step. however, there are still places in the world where the children's marriage is legal or still the norm, although there are laws that prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia contents</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia site in English was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Compiled by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series are fighting against the blockade.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-sealed Internet users are used to using bypass tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, periodic blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid out all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer-computer connections), which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">Despite the legal ban, the content is available.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the news (about the locking of Wikipedia), we put everything in store snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users view at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, an error page of Wikipedia, as well as WikiLeror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar Mirrorpages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as collaborators at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses to a different URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server will guide the query to the correct Wikipedia site, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A suhlender Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and well-balanced colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time, he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepalese wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that attract the attention of Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti River a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to gnash pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he stood face to face with Tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot disturb from the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the book appeared. he starts immediately, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ottern at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-released as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women are concerned with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by a fake court from the Indian State of Odisha and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relative with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer allowances to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, came to a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community of Video Volunteers and is committed to demining the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as childrenâ s marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected individuals, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports on how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion group was women who do not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not saying aloud to the names of their husbands is a custom that they all dufully upheld and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered a deceitful woman, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion club with this self-confidence in their luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"" "many women had never heard the word" "" "Patriarchate" "" "before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked everybody," "" "If we can't tell the names of our husbands, but they can call us how they want it means that they do not respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the crushing of a centuries-old tradition where married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was only knocking in front of herself during the whole exercise; another decided to let out all the quaint frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in rush-rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinken red dot on the forehead that shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "I said to my husband that I would wear the" "" "zinken red dot" "" "if he did it too." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not cease completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have never talked so frankly about some things, for example our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to tell certain things out loud, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a saline kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of arguments and discussions about the advantages of their own choice of clothing, morals combined with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round, so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they'll manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times but then stopped saying the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like the haggling around more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a hard-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we're talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29th of this year, the Hashtag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turnaround in the Japanese culture of the postwar era.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who was exclusively interviewed by the Beatles 1964 in London, noted in 2016 on the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">It became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles Memorial Day in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today, the Beatles are sung by the Beatles in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today, Beatles Day is a day of commemoration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "I don't know if this" "" "Winnie the Pooh" "" "doll should represent John Lennon or not." ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese also make pilgrimages to the familiar places that are related to the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, that is your 5 places you absolutely must visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Matthew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>

<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be quirky enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today, Beatles Day is a day of commemoration.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly this year in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the film K-On! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year as well.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course, some companies also use the fan base in the market, such as this Ramen-Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen! today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could it be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">"" "today I will listen to" "" "Yesterday" "" "and eat the Ramen noodles at the Mutaro Koya." ""</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald headed people for organic trade, probably for superstitious purposes, is worried by the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">According to the local superstitions that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC declared.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in the South African country conducted a mission in order to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police already follow the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for supposedly superstitious rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith existed, according to which the victims had power in the head, generating wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the blog's poor Snaippa on Facebook who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (State endangering) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Lius case as an" "" "an internal matter" "" "and a spokesperson said he did not consider it" "" "not required to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to get calls from the international community, Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow him or him to make a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>

<seg id="1636">United Nations: United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Liu a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway - Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a standstill after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China, as exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The European Union, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius as announced on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on June 27 that the message asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US Embassy's call drew a furious response from China, with the Foreign Ministry's declaration that" "" "no country has the right to intervene in isolated and irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government on it, release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu attorney told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervises the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed Liu to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>

<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very worried about Liu on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for his well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish, as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in view of it, he inevitably seemed undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old lyre appears again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He cloaked the corresponding questions with non-answers in a rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng requests Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point, provided he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points to the criticisms that one should start reading the entire address of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam statements, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he said, why the Singapore elections were so unbalanced even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore" "" "is no country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of an adolescent generation makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what awaits me - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I am not even sure if he really believes he is correctly associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "good faith" "" "committed a mistake or was it a Freudian advocate?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of grave importance.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, released a music video that parodies the junta, which took power in 2014, and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>

<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly politically, the music video refers indirectly to the prolonged military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days alone, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.254 times divided and received 8,800 songs.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie Chaplin Video "The dictator" in Thailand was even blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially how it behaves with the state of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video, which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the supreme commander of the Army absolute decision making over important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear provisions are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unity was established in the army which monitors online content and accused persons accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets a strict law against "Lese Majeste" (majesty insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, it came to a coup d'état of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although safety experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The video shows how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in jail, because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened long imprisonment, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, tells Mrs Ramírez, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">"" "where are you Mama Africa?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them drugs that they can't pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mom Africa was a proper nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel the distance together and that the Africans speak already on Whatsapp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil earlier and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez narrates that her guests often send her text messages when she left to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well-known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family welcomed migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them get an adequate price, then he offered them his home for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others will not help. that's the reason I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to press money out of him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single person, offered him the roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, the travellers calmly consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she leaves with numerous photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care whom she made a girl, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she puts it in a nutshell.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they had exchanged news with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app was able to determine and track the sources and the distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting on digital censorship in China mostly focuses on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China," which was based on Twitter, published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the residents randomly to see if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you may be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-growing technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">It also published a Jingwang product description from which it emerges that the software can lift up the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government departments, authorities and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report of Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of Urumqi, a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, to register their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offenses including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, although I did nothing to earn this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Of punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your hangman will delight in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot withhold your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cries weren't enough for him yet, so they exchanged the tube through a cable.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he flips to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and had forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village to Palestine where they lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and questions her old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the whole Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not constrained by boundaries in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special aversion against U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, to do something with his identity as the "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so much about my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a human being" "", "while in water dissolved Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot juncture has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically speaking lukewarm coffee and the wavering of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you look into the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">It is therefore easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed sensuo, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokesperson in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was canceled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the old-time legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila expressed the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which still decided "to use intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be simply silky rhetoric, but actually reflect a more and more clearly-crystallizing reality in Jordan that appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned traditional sex men to Leibe by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently laid-down unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of 'honourable morals' has increased in Jordan - unofficial from the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honourable murders reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victims of attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for combating crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in prison indefinitely" and for their release, many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that long as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate from politics his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics was inadmissible for me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "" "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the nucleus can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, one verse is quite often repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can "get what you want" - whether belief or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and lesbians and that comments on gender equality have been severely censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan online program Roya, to later point out that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a processed version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises openly for the Arabic LGBTQ + community and holds the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuevo, who was later to work on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the Teachers Association, arguing that they were critical of the problems connected with the deep-rooted corruption in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's how it looks like Hdaib - is made up of slow, reasoned and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" "" "experience it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will embrace a real and fundamental openness by music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial ways. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is so far, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebula festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in many parts of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the forts, drums and dancing came across more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan marched into the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking forward to the Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two cars are just to be seen.</seg>

<seg id="2167">External appearances and body care were seldom as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth out of crime and to promote a legitimate job as the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate, where traffic noise and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing a growing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and hence the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more normal citizens to embark on the experienced hands of hairdressers that can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks on how to watch in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair tools and to obtain training in barber art instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and talked about some of their successes:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages to guerilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went out to the young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la-liación (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement, which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was deemed so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the Colombians, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried their arms around the clock, now have to reintegrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, once accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred for guerrilla fighters, must now enter into its ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the Letters to Reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people that needed the most urgent response this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former combatants of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN stores in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo of the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally hand over the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members stood up as they had done before, in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a sort of hut in which the guerilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in because next to him on the bed was a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "he answered," "" "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never before in my life someone wrote to me something so beautiful, so I answer." "" "suddenly the tears came to me over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely, and sat down beside the garnet.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of war, was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC had already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state exerted on the entire Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "one goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw as a monster and even hated even people with beautiful feelings, who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would rule after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to resort to arms, to rise up and protest for their rights. and that is fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now focusing on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up at the hospital in the last analysis.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got involved and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two bites in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nursing wings were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>

<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya in order to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some told me that I needed to prove it by running through the streets at the top; others wanted me to appear in Grozny on official TV and say that I didn't change my gender that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have said on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to handle this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>

<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she laid a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window, a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 included.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still can't grasp how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "at the moment when I wanted to call my mother per WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't believe, you're in safety just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">People know in which hotel you are hiding. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove to you: it's number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the gender balance, that's a taboo issue.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish it, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I am really struggling to see the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who injected for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With that, I mean, they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there wouldn't be too many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face the Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that one can present them as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television, claiming that they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were deliberately dipped in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who imprisoned in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew up.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was even involved when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, and there have been no reports yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already well-known when I was living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>

<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never even curved my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>

<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov stepped onto the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began speaking on television about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but primarily on the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, you could feel the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who laughed and laughed before, gazed at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In that time I left Chechnya.</seg>

<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who wish to work and remain anonymous in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video posted on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that several others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have appealed this month.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family-fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work due to the persecution by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 had undertaken great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable arable land for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, hunger and privation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denies the Ahrazi Arabs systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arabic regions to the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused in the region by dryness, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish- and palm-industry industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawks was now up to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, finished primary school, finished 55% of a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab states have to endure, human rights activists strike alarms before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - respond with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of the same education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I'm suffering twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I speak on skin color, on racism, black women women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused under racism and discrimination, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists choose to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">"" "but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "" "lift up their voices and sing" "" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "" "in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexualized violence there is institutionalised form of racist violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school than white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I can not join a movement in whose center is the white woman who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which relate to the sex as well as the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a simple and marginalised being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups which also assimilate our customs and customs by cultural appropriation, in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to expose white women to the importance of overcutting of skin color and gender. because some of them continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to detach myself completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than for a white-feminist paradigm that is so obstinate that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before, that we define black women to us according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: recall that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift up black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither ignored nor ignored nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had been violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena for ill treatment, Ada Báez had no avail.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife retired.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, if women make an announcement at all, they generally receive no support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit that they are victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>

<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>

<seg id="2493">86% of the police's ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of women's ads came here too.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for medical research conducted on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and the lack of investment for research into these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research conducted by African scientists can help build up its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>

<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: currently the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sámi national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how large is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>

<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, study of space, healthcare (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience?</seg>

<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as Outredgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green colour or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants such as crop or carton varieties. based on these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition Morton still breeds salad, but it takes longer because his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if a boulder is lying in a river to which I have to commute." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">"" "and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new type of lettuce, because all the characteristics are already patented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very cautious and endeavours not to use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the USA and throughout the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts at the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten Red Römersalat of the Outredgeous variety in the "glasshouse" of the station, where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not to sow it immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are in control of the seeds and the ability to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in greater cohesion such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultivating seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg stresses that the" "" "open source" "" "movement does not deal with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds," he says and takes care of the increasingly widespread mergers in the global agribusiness, as it is offered for example on farmers markets, should also know that the way in which this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain freely available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool shrinks incessantly due to increasing intellectual property rights to plant material that is becoming more and more limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about one third of all the carrots are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be usable either at all or only aggravated.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants yet, but experts such as Luby suggest that large-scale crops such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specific desired traits - from those that enhance their taste or colour to those that thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders decreases through more and more patents. at present genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before, as the changed conditions are much less predictable due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to maintaining biodiversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property restrictions other breeders because" "" "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result using another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection thus prevents innovation, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how available to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: waiting 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain:" "" "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to make farmers their job easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In all, Morton is bothering on the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety also breeds its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation large herds of herbicides are needed, breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is meticulous." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto are) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patenting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding crop patents: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors will sell my grades myself in a few years, "he says." with a patent, you are protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy to think of. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">While the US seems to be a leader in Open Source breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a "open source" seed program. to preserve the seeds of traditional crops, the centre works with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation agreements col works on an open source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to Breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, which is why the Ossi obligation cannot simply be taken over to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Committee of the European Union, the European Commission, stated that conventionally bred plants should not be patented.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human Rights Organization and Blog are the newest targets of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "August has published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities strongly criticized this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information persists in spite of this attack and the mocking of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should actually defend the law, to defy the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never as important as now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the barriers and not to give in. we insist on fulfilling our task further.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Qatar based on alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web site lockings to the victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no longer has access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he used to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government was even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">The blogger, which is also home to Canada's blog, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada said to the government and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">To lock blogs is very old but has priority in the Erdelfattah al-Sisi era; and although the block of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey the feeling of a state of siege; An arrest, a attempted murder, a summons to the National Security Council, the blocking blogs and any other website for which I was working.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">At first I used it to post items to bypass censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, having locked him and that they're afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the closure of providers, which was possible through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we noticed how the closure of web pages that VPNs offered began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation is worsened by the fact that the decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed to court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers report in Brazil with gloomy news from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school" "", "" "" "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro" "", "" "" "thieves robbed pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airtwafee to Rio." ""</seg>

<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice called even the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "so the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published in Rio for detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "", "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city will be published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio, is published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that as journalists we do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a martial art in a country that does not recognise the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities by the police who only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira argues that violence is called a "war." according to her opinion, this is a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to accountable those responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the mordrates per state, Rio is on No.16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition to Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecilia, has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">To these security policy measures, the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, aims to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police force and permanently stationing one unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline of violent deaths. for several years, however, the UPP has been increasingly under fire following several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles in 2010, explaining why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This calls for the state to use resources and ways that are typical of war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for "collateral damage" and "lost spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">The fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police cleared the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyalist troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpetrated by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus, causing inhabitants to rely on locally produced food or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockade traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, its nutritional value makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, Abo Nabil, spoke to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in homes and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that for three years it has been struggling to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more prominence. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowd funding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the shortage of fuel, locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began" "" "production of fungal seeds from the regions" "" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms throughout East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of the 15th and 16th October. this led to the government calling out a federal government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>

<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>

<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself, in order to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the site where we worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">"" "there were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we do not freeze at night." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf drove his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high welcome quotas, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers have found in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights Organization, Civil Liberties Union for Europe, writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "", "these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be withdrawn for months following the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it took Asharaf as well.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible twins helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked several years in the construction industry for several years, Asharaf disclosed his entire savings to the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian Luxury - ein Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, some 20,000 people live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years a number of Afghans operated companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, in which the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp restaurant in Padua, Spice and also behind the Kabulogna Pizzeria in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharafs goals, however, extend far beyond the Italian restaurant business and retail and aim back to the country it forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily if I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans along the way.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Citizen report: drafts from Egypt allow shut-down social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported about the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Pictures of @ Ciluna27 are shared on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen-Report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">"" "" "" "the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that provides users with social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government authority." ""</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register in order to use social networks within six months of successful legislative decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If you miss this step, you may be sentenced to up to six months in prison or the final settlement of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty members of parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May, another MP submitted a legislative proposal to introduce harsher penalties for the insulting of the president or a senior official." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, however, such an act would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is in danger already for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who took photos on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 protestants who had been arrested in the same incident, four years in prison for a court hearing.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, the trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree on the apparent strain of e.g. weapons, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza acquitted the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their reporting to the pro-Morsi session blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the penalties of journalists Abdullah al-Faktorany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Listen to Tunisian activists on leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated by the President of the Republic who, according to the plan, endorsed a controversial draft law that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption accused officers of amnesty, provided they return all unlawful monies.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April on the website of Nawaat casts a light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the designation of his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he witnessed in the case of the District Court in Tunis on May 09.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to demonstrate their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new rules of the information bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the Regulations it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that by doing so the elimination of anonymous comments is to be achieved within social networks. it is unclear until now how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed social media to selectively enforce these regulations in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat missed to register with the state government as" "" "organiser of the spread of information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force it on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites include websites such as Vkontakte and OdnoClassiniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees blocking Wikipedias</seg>

<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain can't stop sniffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">This week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that decode data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">However, the government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal, but has abandoned other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
