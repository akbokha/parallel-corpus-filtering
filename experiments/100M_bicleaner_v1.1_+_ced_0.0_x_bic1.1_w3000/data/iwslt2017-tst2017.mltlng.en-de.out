this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally heard phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally translated blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb .
if this sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has identified cracks and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they give .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en therefore had the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they have been indications for years that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failing to fail and to make a crack , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept his telephone bill secretly ,
just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit history , and even travel links with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , justice has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as government technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there are communication software that didn &apos;t exist , as Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source trans@@ mitt@@ ance system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet @-@ most famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and today is developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site like the Washington Post here .
you can upload documents or send information there , just like in any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective message agency has access .
so the government can no longer secretly proc@@ ure information , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spi@@ on@@ ag@@ et@@ echn@@ ologies that end@@ anger all of us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to kill mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot; &quot; &quot;
or the nearest environmental representative , the alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a wall street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data sheet of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; have hidden enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were sent messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister res@@ igned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is alleged that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait nerv@@ ously for the next release , and to the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent ller or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems to be away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few of them to hide and obsc@@ ure their fortun@@ es -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter .
probably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who came up with this scandal in these revelations .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a dat@@ le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states you need less information , you need to provide less information to set up a company than to get a library card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator called himself an African minister who wanted to bring a susp@@ icious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked all our investig@@ ators to make suggestions on how to transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single peak politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about how the system works through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that some things have begun to change .
over the past few years we have seen bre@@ aches of more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has entered into central registers at the national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is hi@@ ring here .
representatives of both parties have tab@@ led a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake labels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this type of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally stop the transparency which now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after completing my design studies , I made a res@@ ale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained standing and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go to the peace @-@ cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aked at the to@@ e tips to the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who only waited for them to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a jump two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how to make something for that . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and established so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that we were finding new friends at the same time and were able to pay our rent ?
things got rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people are posting images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can invite other people to stay overnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we , as children , have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on the things you can do . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , among people who had never met before .
can design do such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it &apos;s a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I want you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your own mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this silent An@@ flug of panic you now feel -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , kitchen , toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so even most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who actually has Al G@@ ores mobile now ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is calling for the office of the president ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I would like to tell you some of the discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor would have imagined it with his name ; if he had told him where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine that you would have 150 evaluations that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well with@@ drew cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
thanks to a well thought out feedback system , trust is crucial .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to reject negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had handed over their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence .
we trust most of the people who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation em@@ bodies simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you buy from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we didn &apos;t expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly : a need that had not been met before .
the business is running very well for us .
of course there are also times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed to celebrate parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it already hur@@ ts if I just think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million medi@@ ated overnight stays had a problem .
for people trusted one another to be right .
when trust works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travellers who are prone to heart attacks due to se@@ dent@@ ary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books .
you can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions go together ?
it is a matter of economic activity here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now simply call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people leave a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
if you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place that one visits , a group there would wait to fill up a thoroughly and show a neighborhood where one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from reason to shared ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of joint participation ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces belonging to the government ,
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a stay ,
were taught to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator programs were launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality was already there before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did it work ?
apart from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep root prejudi@@ ces .
I find it ast@@ ounding ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can use for design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or just a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
people probably don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber riders .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born like that .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ st me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was for me a feminist declaration of independence , as opposed to the pressure that I felt as a 17 year old to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted my parents &apos; faith pas@@ sively .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that horrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into indign@@ ation .
why should one do that ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Ne@@ ar Eastern origin ... &quot; ... ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; sh@@ at@@ tered Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ icious one .
on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start studying .
I remember -- when we drove silent -- as deep as we went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were held for Muslims , gr@@ asp@@ ed and sm@@ ashed .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it &apos;s called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we go ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my community as a tumour in the body of the USA .
the question is : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the US &apos;s body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
there might be a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to consider people of other faith more tolerant , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and like me a head of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
as a first person , the person is cut off from their community , even from their families so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would fit into their imag@@ inations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you take a look at them , they don &apos;t drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke , put her to silence and told her that her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts , which promised her a solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we are more than accepting an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that when people report messages reported negative about Muslims , they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims shot upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two periods of election .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for the manipulation of the public to under@@ mine the fund@@ ament of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
when assign@@ ing collective debt , it is not just about having to explain yourself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .
he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit to her brother and wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as when he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he fired on De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we talked about it and for us it was no easy decision as it was about what America we want to give to our children : one thing that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion .
we decided for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled off my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw caused me to stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had the courage and compassion preferred to panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with depth , working in a pos@@ h think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study carried out on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is just about becoming a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones .
before air pack@@ et delivery entered our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks live in front of the audience . some years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flight devices , flying devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
they can also build up independent , resili@@ ent structures .
they have learned to bear loads , cope with turbul@@ ence and generally react to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
an aircraft trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other starter ppers , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gl@@ ers it can float , and thus has great advantages in start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a flip side .
a limitation of rear lights is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the power can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions that come to the heart of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mo@@ ve@@ able parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote control units that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically most remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no other actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so it can fly soli@@ dly , and move in space over everywhere .
nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the probability of throwing it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in gener@@ osity , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be imagined in models , the rest will learn directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise sense .
when one builds them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if too limited .
we will now demonstrate this by flying a half .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure press over there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , transforming the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they lit more bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life had just emerged on Earth .
since then , the earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing up to us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group decided particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most people thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which improved the recognition performance enormously .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some small , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes smoked through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
in essence , it was the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist on MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their signals meas@@ urable by observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a wave of gravity is a ri@@ pple in the structure of space and time .
when the wave is over@@ hau@@ led , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other .
in order to illustrate , lec@@ turers in the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a truly al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stri@@ ped by us at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Therefore the Lig@@ o employees declared ins@@ ane .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and this is absurd , this length would have to be accurately measured on less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the nucle@@ us of an atomic nucle@@ us . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength far smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical because you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light around you coming from several points .
in tones , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually , impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
your child &apos;s face , for example .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob is interrup@@ ting her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampli@@ tude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the All .
listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just like : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same p@@ ine@@ e with an additional key change . that sounds like the wu wu wu wu wu wu wu wu wu wu wu .
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14th , 2015 -- a date , at least I will never forget -- I heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; Y@@ et , who knows what to hear , recognis@@ es this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold sun mass that rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s consider briefly what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , rot@@ ates hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to resear@@ ching the universe as it had never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in all , we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ a .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen at the core hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never pass through as these are op@@ ak .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly , I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run , which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o watching them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the sour bones for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o offers us a completely different perspective on events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you are dre@@ aming with us .
thank you .
some time ago , I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I start playing the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , eliminated my fear .
my fear of holding speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guess , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked her once I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the beginning
from then on , I swear to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or wherever I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I realized that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , stir up your life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create TV . I produce TV .
I do TV , in a grand style .
in this TV season I am responsible for applying 70 hours of program to the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes at the same time : 24 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series are running in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programs that I have created myself , and not only produced , so even on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is still doing this ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; writer &quot; falls .
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company , a country or a class@@ rooms , a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work so you understand that I &apos;m not just sitting on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dreams in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I go into work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it &apos;s like I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
as a result , one can see a high sound , deliver a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work is working well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the sum that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the bu@@ zz@@ ing -- when I began working and working with television production when I began working and working , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the sums are more than writing .
bu@@ zz@@ ing is action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t strive otherwise than by size .
the feeling of not being different than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called Sum@@ ma .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make one thing clear : the more successful I get , the more episodes , the more crowded boundaries , the more work there , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more I write history .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums .
I love this h@@ um . I love the h@@ um .
I need the sums . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
over@@ worked , over@@ stressed , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single working institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guess , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ anic .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were stopped .
the hum@@ ming of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , through @-@ worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a pre @-@ show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hypo@@ c@@ ite , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do , you &apos;re working , you love what you &apos;re doing , a teacher to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the sums already , when you stop the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say No , when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; guess . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anybody any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my sums are smoking , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in soli@@ tude and lack of money , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity is .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the working environment , the titanium dioxide , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sum is not a force and it is not labor @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the electricity that comes from the lust of life .
real money is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be experienced , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice unless I want to hear the sums .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t think about how to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer working at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person is better working than being at home ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we rage around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we zer@@ o@@ ed soap bubbles .
I mostly feel stiff , absent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I wonder : why did we ever stop playing ?
you can also ! tell them if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you consider me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ aming dream .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show @-@ figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones do not want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and speak to my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes per piece !
no mobile phone , no washing , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz of having a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and store it yourself .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m leaving and I &apos;m victorious . friends meeting , reading books , enjoying the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for all I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in my training when I wanted to beat myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes by the piece , why not allow for a full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy enters in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown tune , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is a shame for me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes to less work and more games &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the country I created , the marathon I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the hum@@ ming , the other , the right h@@ um : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new feeling of being alive within me . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll get you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , has a very low ability for self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
certainly , they have heard from one of the most known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; an electro@@ de is im@@ planted deeply in the brain in order to influence the ne@@ ural circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from violent trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that the brain is sw@@ amped with skull @-@ brain trauma and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life , you have to reduce the pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted cells to grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting the cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed to succeed .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
one thing is , however , clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then color them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re @-@ planted them at the sampling point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t - aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ import these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ import the same cells into fo@@ amed brain tissue ?
thanks to Professor Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we re @-@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed , they go back home .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and re @-@ imported exactly the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
the evidence they show are these little d@@ ots . these are the cells we painted in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets from a tray .
they did that very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured in the motor cor@@ tex the motor skills range .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
exactly as it would happen to people , they spontaneously recre@@ ated themselves up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous rest , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side they see the monkey who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after Rei@@ m@@ plantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes to someone to come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi@@ center study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that &apos;s not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew of Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is wan@@ ing with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs realised in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are succ@@ es@@ ful , we could save us democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy our societies are bri@@ gh@@ tened , our future is glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the twin peaks parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt , which th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , but they are too afraid to invest in places where it would be productive and produce income with which it could produce the mountain and produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rail , equipment and so on and so forth .
$ 3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar sounds a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it to the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate stock exchanges and raise real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors that would not invest . just like E@@ edi@@ pus Father , who would be out of fear that his son would kill him if he &apos;s grown up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances cause o@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my coat with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; his extremely wast@@ eful type All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the importance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which granted them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal bal@@ lot in questions of the state che@@ ek .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long --
like a candle lit very bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burned out .
however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy first arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- was a democracy @-@ free zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , while the economy gradually w@@ anders politics and dis@@ em@@ powers them .
are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as they used to be ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because it can be in the government today and yet not in power , because the power is diver@@ ted from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s something like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals they feed on , so that they star@@ ve at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics itself so far that it har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods become de@@ valued , the overall economic demand falls , and the directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the wa@@ sting of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we need to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; maintains control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t look very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and wa@@ sting .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts deeper , as it does -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we must re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are serving people and humans are putting their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Athens &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations the meaning of life .
I think we can be optimistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what would it be , how could it look like to have this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peculiar utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation I would like to give you some examples .
in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one work station to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those belonging to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but which the company does not belong to . no exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no upward twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please be aware that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time a liber@@ t@@ arian in whom it fav@@ ours privileged persons , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the garbage bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Fr . Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , the technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only destabili@@ se our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not enter@@ tained , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday evening dinner of the speakers you said very clearly what you think about the West &apos;s view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
we have the appearance of democracy in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was especially scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ el@@ ly smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is to say goodbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent denial that a massive rejection line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to run , which is massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- that was , by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this denial --
unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , still have chosen the denial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might delay it for a while , but when the changes enter , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ ini ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister who in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in len@@ ders of len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not possible .
they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions caused by the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit they had been running a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody from the tro@@ ika of the credi@@ tors who imposed on us this policy was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we permit ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard most of all , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company at Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a re@@ fres@@ her and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ ques , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the contents that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of over 2,500 TV series on the IM@@ DB site . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows you get this review .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to prohi@@ bit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time Amazon makes something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and selected eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online where they can look at everyone for free .
and if Amazon publishes things for nothing , do you intervene correctly ?
millions of spectators are watching these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you can see when you start the show , when you pause , which parts are ski@@ pped or viewed again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show , because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
approximately at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of staging a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you encounter , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the multi @-@ health system here ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in jail .
if someone is in jail in the USA and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
this is not because a company such as Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google does sometimes make mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis of flu , the worst kind , can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked perfectly , year around year , until it suddenly ceased working ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google mis@@ understand sometimes something .
despite all these errors , data flows increasingly into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious choices , such as decision making for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have seen some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
do you have to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things :
first , put this problem into its components so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a resolution .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it all : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that is why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been unable to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they vie for TV ideas when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they were always able to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is telling us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start controlling our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decision making .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will take it out later with a technique demo .
I have made some decisions in my life so far , and I should have heard in hind@@ sight on the ball .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and take risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
