<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally heard phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally translated blueprints for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has identified cracks and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblower and spy journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen therefore had the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they have been indications for years that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing to fail and to make a crack, that could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have kept his telephone bill secretly,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit history, and even travel links with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead, justice has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as government technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that didn't exist, as Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmittance system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the Internet-most famous Aaron Swartz, and today is developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can upload documents or send information there, just like in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective message agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer secretly procure information, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spionagetechnologies that endanger all of us." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have a way to kill misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the nearest environmental representative, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a wall street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>

<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest data sheet of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] have hidden enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were sent messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox companies in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait nervously for the next release, and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent ller or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortunes in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by a few of them to hide and obscure their fortunes -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who came up with this scandal in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a datleck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states you need less information, you need to provide less information to set up a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "" "" "this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator called himself an African minister who wanted to bring a suspicious money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked all our investigators to make suggestions on how to transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it is not about a single peak politician, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "it's about how the system works through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very mischievous as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen breaches of more transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has entered into central registers at the national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is hiring here.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have tabled a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake labels." ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy who get up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this type of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together, we can finally stop the transparency which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after completing my design studies, I made a resale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained standing and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says he would go to the peace-corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I get there?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sneaked at the toe tips to the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who only waited for them to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a jump two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how to make something for that. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "we created a website and established so" "" "air mattresses and breakfast" "" "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb]." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were finding new friends at the same time and were able to pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things got rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website where people are posting images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can invite other people to stay overnight.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "this will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we, as children, have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can concentrate on the things you can do. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, among people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your own mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent Anflug of panic you now feel -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, kitchen, toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So even most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is calling for the office of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I would like to tell you some of the discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have imagined it with his name; if he had told him where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that you would have 150 evaluations that all say: "he can really hold very well withdrew cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Thanks to a well thought out feedback system, trust is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to reject negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had handed over their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust most of the people who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's reputation -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation embodies similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you buy from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I'm doing holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct quantity of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we didn't expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly: a need that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is running very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are also times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed to celebrate parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it already hurts if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million mediated overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted one another to be right.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, wonderful things can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travellers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they pass books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled over this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions go together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a matter of economic activity here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now simply call it" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People leave a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place that one visits, a group there would wait to fill up a thoroughly and show a neighborhood where one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from reason to shared?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was already there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep root prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it astounding,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder what we can use for design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">People probably don't talk to their Uber riders.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to oust me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover.</seg>

<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was for me a feminist declaration of independence, as opposed to the pressure that I felt as a 17 year old to adapt me to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted my parents' faith passively.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>

<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>

<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my community as a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question is: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumour in the US's body, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There might be a few parking spaces, but don't stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people of other faith more tolerant, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And like me a head of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">As a first person, the person is cut off from their community, even from their families so that the extremists believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would fit into their imaginations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology based on their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality that makes them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke, put her to silence and told her that her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists, which promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We are more than accepting an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that when people report messages reported negative about Muslims, they are rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood against Muslims shot upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two periods of election.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for the manipulation of the public to undermine the fundament of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When assigning collective debt, it is not just about having to explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when did my brother become such an accomplished young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as when he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He fired on Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We talked about it and for us it was no easy decision as it was about what America we want to give to our children: one thing that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exert our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled off my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw caused me to stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled people were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had the courage and compassion preferred to panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>

<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have met a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with depth, working in a posh think tank, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at the Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest study carried out on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is just about becoming a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packet delivery entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower of 1,500 bricks live in front of the audience. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flight devices, flying devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build up independent, resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear loads, cope with turbulence and generally react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest level, e.g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">An aircraft trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starter ppers, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the Starrflüglers it can float, and thus has great advantages in start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a flip side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear lights is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the power can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask basic abstract questions that come to the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moveable parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote control units that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically most remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no other actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so it can fly solidly, and move in space over everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is an exercise in generosity, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be imagined in models, the rest will learn directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise sense.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller falls out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if too limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by flying a half.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopters -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure press over there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, transforming the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit more brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life had just emerged on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is standing up to us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group decided particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most people thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following years, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which improved the recognition performance enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some small, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes smoked through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on MIT. he has been studying gravitational-waves from black holes and their signals measurable by observatories like Ligo. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravity is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When the wave is overhauled, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">In order to illustrate, lecturers in the theory of relativity often lead to a truly albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretch and stow, stretch and stow." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and striped by us at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1st Therefore the Ligo employees declared insane.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is absurd, this length would have to be accurately measured on less than one thousandth of the nucleus of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength far smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical because you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light around you coming from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually, impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">Your child's face, for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just Alice is talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob is interrupting her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "stupid Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the All.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravitation can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just like: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies turn very fast, one hears the same pinee with an additional key change. that sounds like the wu wu wu wu wu wu wu wu wu wu wu.</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14th, 2015 -- a date, at least I will never forget -- I heard the following: [Surrender noise] Yet, who knows what to hear, recognises this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold sun mass that rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, rotates hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to researching the universe as it had never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all, we can't see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernova.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen at the core hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through as these are opak.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly, I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first run, which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the type of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo watching them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the sour bones for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo offers us a completely different perspective on events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>

<seg id="552">You are dreaming with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say" "" "yes!" "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I start playing the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, eliminated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of holding speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "estimations" "", "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>

<seg id="573">This was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">From then on, I swear to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or wherever I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I realized that the" "" "yes" "" "say to play with my children saved my career." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I think things out, stir up your life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do TV, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for applying 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes at the same time: 24 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series are running in 256 languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programs that I have created myself, and not only produced, so even on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "writer" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company, a country or a classrooms, a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work so you understand that I'm not just sitting on the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreams in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I go into work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a result, one can see a high sound, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the sum that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzzing -- when I began working and working with television production when I began working and working, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">Buzzing is action and activity. the sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't strive otherwise than by size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called Summa.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make one thing clear: the more successful I get, the more episodes, the more crowded boundaries, the more work there, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more I write history.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I love this hum. I love the hum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overworked, overstressed, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mom is a single working institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "guess, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titanic.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums were stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, through-worked weekends, no regrets, nothing to delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "hypocite, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do, you're working, you love what you're doing, a teacher to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz when you know the sums already, when you stop the buzz, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern state waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says:" "" "mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say No, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me "guess."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she doesn't call anybody any more" "" "guess." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my sums are smoking, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and lack of money, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">"" "all that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in" "" "The Ice Queen" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity is.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzzing, the working environment, the titanium dioxide, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself using broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labor-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzzing is the electricity that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real money is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be experienced, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice unless I want to hear the sums.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't think about how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person is better working than being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan."</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rage around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We zeroed soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I mostly feel stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why did we ever stop playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! tell them if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you consider me naïve, for a daydreaming dream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show-figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones do not want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak to my teenie-daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no washing, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. they don't have to be the children. it is important to feel the buzz of having a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to play" "" "Play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it yourself.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy enters in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown tune, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzzing of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzzing of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is a shame for me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">"" "I said" "" "Yes to less work and more games" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire is still burning.</seg>

<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the country I created, the marathon I run, the troops, the canvases, the high tone, the humming, the other, the right hum: the buzz of life.</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, in contrast to other body organs, has a very low ability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly, they have heard from one of the most known, the "deep brain stimulation." an electrode is implanted deeply in the brain in order to influence the neural circuits in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, suffering from violent trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that the brain is swamped with skull-brain trauma and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, you have to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted cells to grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting the cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is, however, clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then color them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we re-planted them at the sampling point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant - autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-import these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-import the same cells into foamed brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Professor Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we re-planted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed, they go back home.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and re-imported exactly the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little dots. these are the cells we painted in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did that very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured in the motor cortex the motor skills range.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Exactly as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recreated themselves up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous rest, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after Reimplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes to someone to come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That's not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy is waning with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are succesful, we could save us democracy, but that we need a truthful and defenseless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are brightened, our future is gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the twin peaks paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt, which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, but they are too afraid to invest in places where it would be productive and produce income with which it could produce the mountain and produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, rail, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3.4 trillion US dollar sounds a lot of money, until one compares it to the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate stock exchanges and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in an endless loop, advocates the pessimism of investors that would not invest. just like Eedipus Father, who would be out of fear that his son would kill him if he's grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily, the circumstances cause oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my coat with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "his extremely wasteful type All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the importance of the Athenian democracy on account of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which granted them the right to political co-determination with equal ballot in questions of the state cheek.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy hasn't lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle lit very brightly, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today's liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy first arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- was a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, there has been a relentless struggle between the two, while the economy gradually wanders politics and disempowers them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because it can be in the government today and yet not in power, because the power is diverted from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's something like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals they feed on, so that they starve at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has cannibalised politics itself so far that it harms itself through the self-created economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, political goods become devalued, the overall economic demand falls, and the directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism distributes the "demos" from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the wasting of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we need to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" maintains control, just as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn't look very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new ways of brutality and wasting.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, as it does -- very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must reunite the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy which makes the film "Matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines are serving people and humans are putting their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athens "Agora," in long conversations the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "what would it be, how could it look like to have this" "" "Star Trek" "" "peculiar utopia instead of the" "" "matrix" "" "similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one work station to the next, and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and from redeeming and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those belonging to the companies, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but which the company does not belong to. no exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no upward twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please be aware that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency that is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time a libertarian in whom it favours privileged persons, and Marxian because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the garbage bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Fr. Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, the technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, therefore I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not entertained, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday evening dinner of the speakers you said very clearly what you think about the West's view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">We have the appearance of democracy in our liberal democracies.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I may say this provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smelly smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro zone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "that is to say goodbye to complacency, and the permanent denial that a massive rejection line went through the eurozone, and continues to run, which is massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- that was, by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">Unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the European group, still have chosen the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, you might delay it for a while, but when the changes enter, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernsthini...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or any minister who in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in lenders of lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not possible.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions caused by the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit they had been running a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>

<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if it does not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we permit ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930, what appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard most of all, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company at Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a refresher and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Movies, TV, Techniques, Tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the contents that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of over 2,500 TV series on the IMDB site. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows you get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like Breaking Bad, "Game of Thrones," "The Wire," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a relay, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the turn." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to prohibit "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time Amazon makes something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selected eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and makes them online where they can look at everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon publishes things for nothing, do you intervene correctly?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You can see when you start the show, when you pause, which parts are skipped or viewed again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show, because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Approximately at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of staging a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you encounter, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, this is a bit scary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the multi-health system here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail in the USA and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">This is not because a company such as Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google does sometimes make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that data analysis of flu, the worst kind, can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year around year, until it suddenly ceased working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google misunderstand sometimes something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flows increasingly into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginably many data to make serious choices, such as decision making for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have seen some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have to solve a complex problem, mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, put this problem into its components so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the individual parts together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That is why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been unable to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together again and make a show like "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they vie for TV ideas when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision, because they were always able to say:" "" "this is telling us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data start controlling our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decision making.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will take it out later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have made some decisions in my life so far, and I should have heard in hindsight on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
