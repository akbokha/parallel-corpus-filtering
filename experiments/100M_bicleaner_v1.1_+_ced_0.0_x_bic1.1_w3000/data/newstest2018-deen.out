Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people should meet today .
a mine chapel , which is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers .
Munich &apos;s oldest official card encourages exciting stories .
it is annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
that knows everybody who had to be upset because the car na@@ vi was showing a green meadow instead of a stra@@ pping road .
the historical maps of the Digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very revealing .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the area of the Munich Mer@@ cury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work , which one does not recognize as such .
more detailed maps , so @-@ called document sheets , have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ veying Authority between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
their client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was the neighbours of today who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph moved forward the project , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ veying Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ posi@@ tional Sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was registered 21 years after the map was created , thus 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when entering in , a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbers numbered from the so @-@ called &quot; original photograph &quot; from which the land tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots today no longer occupy farmers , but small farmers in the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in the Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ vi@@ ese , the scene of the October festival in 18@@ 10 , was indeed a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of the present district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the area of the present district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street names &quot; on Gast@@ eig &quot; or &quot; On the L@@ air , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , people once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich County Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was established there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the accus@@ ations of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the staff from using violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um are now on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Institute .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
to the west lies the football pitch of the TS@@ V München , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was erected in architectural style reminiscent of the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 and the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre .
a big stayed until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the for@@ emen and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn ( urban rail ) line will take place .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Union for the Promotion of Far@@ mers issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is scheduled to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , demands af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special care while travelling , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based incidents occur in recent times throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Group &apos;s comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the state law enforcement authorities , who are dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , caused the group to issue the travel warning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US .
the group quoted incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during his journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Prosecutor , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state pay 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready if they bring Cau@@ tion money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which classi@@ fies the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States adopted immigration laws that obli@@ ge local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profile .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the USA .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ bach Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ ous Project is a success project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U members of the Bundestag Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac received an image on site .
in the right @-@ wing court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ bach &quot; CD@@ U &quot; association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 milk cows and also many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing pathway for him for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste is exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also chairman of B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot produce profit@@ ably on such steep faces .
the grass@@ land area provides a lot of work , much has to be mach@@ ined with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann emphasized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he does not conduct bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad of the leader &apos;s support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are the farmers would have to be supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be dra@@ fted for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding
a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced in 2013 by eleven participants .
the conservation area is 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
the total cost of 71 500 Euro was promoted by half over leader , one quarter bore the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
thus , the farmers had to stay 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers it doesn &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Weiss also stated : &quot; here the best foods are produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Clear@@ ance Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg enables the government to promote pasture f@@ ences .
the aim is to hold the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the f@@ enced area must not be tractor @-@ cat@@ chy ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the Fis@@ her@@ bach Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ aun@@ ching Project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 pitches , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the surface area is 35 hectares , with calculated costs for more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking off the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ters would have liked him if he had done it .
but he attacked their meaning , and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete story about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to is later added and not part of the Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is perfectly right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus &apos;s stirring words , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , your afflicted masses who desire to breathe freely , the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made clear that these people were not welcome in Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s US .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about America &apos;s meaning .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who chose to place their words at the base after her death - knew very well that she took up a highly political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a traditional visual representation .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American n@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone but rather an early neo@@ conserv@@ atory to bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not ligh@@ ten the road to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh has stum@@ bled across something quite unusual .
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of perception of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative action of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ event@@ ful but hop@@ eful people after long and often horrible voy@@ ages on the deck of ships .
it is a matter of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognise .
their tor@@ ches should not enligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their sole source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish quota in the world championship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think there is something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team for team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in the fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mid @-@ range &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; runs along this road and last year set up five British and two European records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch for a great season that included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members their first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; extremely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also be part of the med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics about Facebook : don &apos;t mess around a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the burning of voters
the father of our country knew something of poor press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he shr@@ u@@ gged in criticism , certainly .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and dum@@ b , we are led as sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it &apos;s a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and play his ha@@ un@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of persons coming to the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum , which is considered officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ y people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I polit@@ ely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other up @-@ to @-@ date news , &quot; she wrote in the comments section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t value this idea either , if a number of people take a stand on the same topic , they are ignored by some more than a so @-@ called collective commitment rather than a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s employees referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical control items , or to arrest and to silence prot@@ esters .
but that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s going on digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mile@@ stones in this question came last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County passed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous writers sl@@ apped on its leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zed his position on the agreement of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not put them into silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty is hoping for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
the former European # 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who took part in Arch@@ er@@ field &apos;s links last year to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition .
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he laid this place .
he is an avi@@ d champion of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels very special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always cher@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the home floor .
this event will be the first Scottish performance ever since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m happy about the way it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994 .
at that time there have been 400 lung cancer cases because of passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
home connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and are &quot; reasonably in the time , &quot; according to the director of the farm Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which is repeatedly ham@@ pered by construction work , represents a big problem for the construction company of St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and barri@@ c@@ des is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days have already been very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian gold country
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai regi@@ men in the troubled Indones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the sal@@ ted tu@@ ber is removed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around after 5 p.m. in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was adopted in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were supposed to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encomp@@ assed the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is boring . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ u@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and of corru@@ gated iron roofs , which have been transformed by rust into different yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans wor@@ shipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , lies only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua that make sure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military and units between 1998 and 2004 almost $ 20 million , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos; tribal lands in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
according to a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e , in which reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a flow of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim migrants from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i are coming .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den can@@ te@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to stop here .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local ones , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local who went to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua - Mama mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian president , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ o , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua during his campaign campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken , because we voted for Jok@@ er in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ic &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took offen@@ se in their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and sm@@ ashed the group with their rif@@ le pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ on , was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting arches and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance , im@@ it@@ ating in the circle and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist@@ ed more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was able to listen in the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ams still don &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who we@@ ars only one name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers only wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman for the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news of the kill@@ ings only arrived on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
after three weeks , Jok@@ er held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical de@@ bris in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for resol@@ ving historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , which the UN was accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; demanded more than 1,000 victims of death in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua have already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims met such claims with fi@@ erc@@ ely dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday , the Indones@@ ian police shot the villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 year old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Bri@@ gade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ ili@@ tary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered , the TI@@ ME . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called on the officers to be held accoun@@ table and withdraw the mobile bri@@ gade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a resting place for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green High@@ lands of Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , who claims to defend the rights of Papua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : mainly not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato in each case .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in a larger number since the opening of new flight routes to Nab@@ lus airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
they rarely have capital or necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world off from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua due to lack of coordination with related institutions , even though rare permits were given to them for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s election campaign were not realized to raise the restrictions of reporting in order to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia &apos;s uns@@ ett@@ led provinces of Papua and West Pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ings .
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ er again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ er is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is located in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ er as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; debt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims carried out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know they might never get justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that in just two years swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per , which is accidentally called the tor@@ ch tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people &apos;s scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said that it is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about security of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages from cl@@ adding , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came .
in the UK , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has failed with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal to play Davis Cup singles for this sport was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the five @-@ sentence classic , which is often very long , but also very este@@ emed , will thus be preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the target of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership didn &apos;t accept the complete reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the application .
not until the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal had already come to play the final on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right next round in the next round .
in order to reduce the cost of the organizers , the requirements in training places , etc . , will be facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring forbidden objects to the plane , find out a pol@@ l
a survey carried out under air passengers found that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items from the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration were smu@@ g@@ gled , including at least 6 percent gu@@ essing the plane while they accidentally bore prohibited knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had been late to discover that they had gone wrong with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey for more than 1,000 people - carried out by a Jet Charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
from those surv@@ eyed who admitted that they know@@ ingly attempted to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common items that have been deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
more than 3 percent reported to have know@@ ingly borne items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male surv@@ eyed also confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs into the plane .
the company said it was asking travelers all over the country to find out how many mistakenly charged smu@@ g@@ gling goods by airport security and how many would have done it inten@@ sely .
it is no surprise that people who were most likely to wear smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through safety , those who most often fly .
the company points out , however , that the T@@ SA policies are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain about which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
it is no surprise that the bulk of the liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while the people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights .

in doing so , he has so far under@@ lined that a part of the customers have already re@@ trac@@ ted their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed a different , less da@@ zzling number : that of the cancell@@ ations in the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has often had over 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Payment . &quot;
currently 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be rolled up - 500@@ ,000 , by 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are at present per day .
who orders a Model 3 today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new production lines tested in practice without even greater interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if there is too much delay , then the liability of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in dro@@ ves .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s from the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of the state &apos;s environmental authorities as far as possible .
he did not mention the complaint which was raised against his previous place in a Federal Court of Appe@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a time limit that ran for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ uted by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a for a long time , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been forced to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA ste@@ ward exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of O@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to co @-@ operate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting to be indic@@ ted by activists and others , and agreed to set the deadline for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in legal proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the O@@ zone rules .
a draft approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York general prosec@@ utor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of States who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reverse of EPA - after our law@@ suits - is an important gain for health and security of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered at P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to engage in environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; &quot; &quot; 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ kirche &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4 : 30 p.m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex is a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be enchan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ lin@@ gens their request .
Walter Martin@@ i stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Schem@@ atic Editor : Count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church belonging to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei by magic Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wor@@ ding of the document , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way around .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today still can be seen in the town image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the magnificent sett@@ ling nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 are supporting these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age came from the early medieval property law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
it was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
three alt@@ ars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two sh@@ at@@ tered on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were placed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was canc@@ eled .
only the church tower was left standing .
during the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the present tower of Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today , Horst K@@ allen@@ ar and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius @-@ system as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organizers , the friends and suppor@@ ter Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle on Sunday , 16 July .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks the words . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
for the seren@@ ade of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk is placed in front of the chur@@ ch@@ yard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers put out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex , which is of importance for Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
the friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to their homeland care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martin@@ i re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to check the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirements for the construction and has therefore turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal have existed a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration area , the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind turbines for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette only a few days before - but it did not appro@@ ve the district government of Düsseldorf because of a fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of affairs : the city council once again decided to re @-@ enter the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been received from the district of Vier@@ sen last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to check the matter once more .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings in the administrative court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argument of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary , plans to build four 200 @-@ metre high wind turbines on an area on the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large area .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity consumption of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this equ@@ ates to approximately one fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ Wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in the process .
two more people were injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car in the course of the accompanying journey with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person took the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are expected to re@@ discover shopping in the city center in September .
the business association and the municipal administration plan to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September in order to attract the residents to the shopping spre@@ e in the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association Christian König announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend aims to raise the customer &apos;s awareness of what offers the city offers to its own city away from the usual supermarket goods .
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action not only targets residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the production weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the business association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include new offerings such as the first active day &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , discussions with all the traders and hosts in order to make them active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping from the view .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city center - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and clubs .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly wi@@ dened , had told king in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , said that the country &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day was held in Thurin@@ gia for the first time .
in addition to bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Industry of the Chamber of Commerce and its many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment himself with his buying behaviour .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at U.S. school
during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new further people were injured .
in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis two people were killed and nine more injured , some of them difficult .
according to the fire bri@@ gade on Wednesday ( local time ) an injury was still in critical condition .
a person died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first mis@@ chief was later found dead as well .
the deaths were employees of the school .
as a case of accident , the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline .
at the time of the holiday , only a few people were staying in the building of the Minn@@ es@@ aha Academy .
Tr@@ ump comp@@ eted after penet@@ rated tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27th , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone call with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned limit wall .
the US president insul@@ ted him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia is &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; dump &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump termin@@ ated the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; That is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : milit@@ ants re @-@ launch rac@@ ist mo@@ ck@@ work as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ year Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ ank to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with guns to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked anxi@@ ously through the wind@@ shield .
inside , the occup@@ ants were in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this horrible scene played on the 22nd of July was just a night@@ mare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience threw out very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists came back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by the K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of mur@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who assi@@ sts in the organisation of post@@ ures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him , the im@@ position serves as a dramatic appeal to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI records obtained by N@@ BC News , more than 50 Mon@@ roe men and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but none was ever indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the open for decades , civil rights say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote their vote for the first time in the summer .
about at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com faced a white landlord , bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore not came from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they got away from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also apparent that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , evi@@ den@@ ced the evidence and obsc@@ ured the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more succ@@ inct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election right massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , then this will happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual report of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and founded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that in America it does not exist any more .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the bl@@ acks pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ enes co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the boss @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be simpler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and push@@ es him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --@@ he , van@@ ishing from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gi@@ g@@ gling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and precisely because the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends non@@ violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a dress of mour@@ ning , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and brings Bil@@ lie Holidays gri@@ eving praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred yards behind , a group of about four dozen spectators wi@@ pes sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
they have spent nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gian oppres@@ sive humidity when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the burial places of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse name .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with actors for dinner .
at a table a white couple from Atlanta talks about the post@@ age with a black couple they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which made a sense of the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ chen is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is only called Police shooting . &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks stays at his table , he eats and reminds of the citizens &apos; rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the post@@ age is in a certain way inspiring , as it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we can &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled Wagner &apos;s role in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful , fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a Wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR period or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhin@@ e@@ ders pos@@ ing as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed barrels of oil remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which moves through its &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ gold - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise wonderfully with the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ess seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , de@@ compos@@ ing a cor@@ pse in the trunk of Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and giving the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glori@@ ously nasty Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a heavy @-@ weight bo@@ xer .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) still has to believe .
the audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause .
stor@@ my celebrated Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bles himself and de@@ fle@@ cts the hands of Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which for the first time on stage shows - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the performance was awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ ellen@@ istic whi@@ stle @-@ concert , five years later , in which the scattered &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; rep@@ ut@@ ations went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ frank@@ incense Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you realize that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has grown together in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown to be an understanding of its viewpoint .
I draw a positive summary .
max quantity operates as a volunteer
they work in several places in their Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Year .
where to go everywhere ?
quantity : usually in a piece of furniture in the furniture market , once a week I am here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in an open whole day .
what are your experiences ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
lot : I did a high school diploma .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broke off .
I recognized for myself that it is a wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it really is at the spot , at the focal point maybe also .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester .
I will study dual studies , probably make a social worker education at Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably always depends where you are going to be FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also part of the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works .
unlike in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind each other .
whether a refugee or a teen@@ ager who has been fet@@ ched out of the family - you always have to respond to it individually .
very interesting .
and they had no reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is facing .
the job cuts that General Director John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , will in addition to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 positions have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the Ber@@ tel@@ smann partner , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five soldiers and an interpreter have been injured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nato . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district , too .
bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a NATO opinion it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was to happen when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the UN , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the United States colon@@ ised the Taliban in 2001 .
violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule following complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , which states that states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that it is showing the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to as@@ certain where inc@@ isions are to be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a broad range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which is said to boost economic growth , according to Tr@@ ump .
however , the efforts have spark@@ ed the set@@ backs of the democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups , who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community plan wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposite voices , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ kler decides to set up a common room in the future sen@@ iors residence .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will continue until the area belonging to the church community has been in municipal ownership until now , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be developed by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a shared space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council would not be able to fores@@ ee such a common space as a meeting place only for residents of the sen@@ i@@ ent housing , but openly to the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision taken by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by means of funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the rehabilitation area .
according to T@@ j@@ aden , the establishment of a shared space would be capable of promoting 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal can be seen to signal the investor that in this respect he does not want to throw a b@@ ill@@ board between the legs , the conclusion that the saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding area - as well as a desk roof - which reduces the pitch and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer believes this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the committee .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings , with which one does not advance so well , but now they lean into the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely referring to the common area - but absolutely against a community participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area there is no grant but get a real , in case of doubt market@@ able counter@@ value , is the counter @-@ speech .
three pro@@ pon@@ ents are found in Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to split the resolution accordingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it stays with two opposing voices in the original program that summari@@ zes Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we put the decision in this way , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cycli@@ st is thrown on the road
at the cross@@ roads of the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder had been on the cycling path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg towards Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic .
he met with a car , who controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a return carriage .
FC Bayern Munich must for@@ ego David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup takes place without it : David Al@@ aba has to let the game play against Dortmund .
with personnel worries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8 : 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) the personnel worries are getting bigger at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8 : 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also refrain from using the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical state and the missing balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was last not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelli@@ gently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
walking in the Har@@ z from Stern to Star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Har@@ z , the nation &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg is planning this .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets the needs of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and star pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ quired of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by the Internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the train will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewer experiences a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another , although it is far away .
also , in which con@@ stellation you will find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can clearly be seen .
since 2003 there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Schol@@ ar@@ ship Planet@@ arium Göttingen since 2003 .
starting in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters away sun is measuring 70 centimet@@ ers .
the total distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to the Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion going down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super @-@ Feder@@ ated Champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you going to champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I went up for Bron@@ x &#91; to 140@@ pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who will also be interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell in the forum on 23 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later openly expressed himself openly to fight for the network that offers the best finance package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a gra@@ cious praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxes .
they both said that they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four Ver@@ sions After Ty@@ re Pi@@ er
in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost sight of his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 p.m. shortly before the connection point , presumably after a tyre bur@@ zer .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then stayed on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed to the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lanes could be passed by the accident site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optim@@ ises the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , as the two opposite were not at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triple chain should also be further optimised .
and a gate after a kick @-@ off doesn &apos;t want to catch the Fort@@ une anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts himself on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better after the experiences in preparation with the triple chain than with the four @-@ hand chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t yet know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident of his cause , &quot; because we are in the triple chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t make so many play@@ mistakes in the setup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak for a draw from a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance might well be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer did not want to know about this .
&quot; I judge the start of the season only after six to eight seasons , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled early due to a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that the players from Au@@ e might even be a little fres@@ her because they had no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know how 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland go to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away , only because we have the right to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive in only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat right from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Chief Coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ t@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started the tests last year .
they should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Committee ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
up to now , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the last months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er lied about his age .
in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the person examined is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had frank@@ ly said that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in the X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot safely say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the Plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg proceed well .
a seven @-@ ton concrete section at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was installed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three rehabili@@ t@@ ating bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side had a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons weigh@@ ted so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a marginal fixing , which is also used as a way of operation .
at the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way will be lost .
the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger firm Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
a special touch of intuition has required the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished first .
the traffic is regulated by an amp@@ el for the bridges between the building yard building and the her@@ mitage in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is completely closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridge groups amounts to a total of 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colourful protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise only difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties represented in the district of volcanic Ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , lef@@ ti@@ sts ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows a peaceful flag this day because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell to the poster &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ Americans , but rather demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the town @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that is there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum One World and one of the major organizers , is really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered a lot of police officers to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing their presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic sul@@ fur , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also a band for entertainment at about 8@@ pm , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ President Uwe Jung .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate to vote for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D @-@ event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police can move away - no special incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re @-@ hearing with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ laughing Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the solo@@ ist of the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
so Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gown , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ä@@ gers N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play mix into a fascinating complete artwork .
this core of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ laughing clo@@ ister church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart said openly about her homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I join in grilled cheese I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably best @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt with bit@@ terly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with each one seriously whom I typ@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism .
so I have never been pu@@ zz@@ led or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was especially suffered by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but at school time she preferred to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt ass@@ aul@@ ted , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , they don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in joy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump had previously announced a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
according to For@@ bes , Justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change of party from Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from working to make our country magnificent again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the f@@ ew@@ est legislative bodies in history , Gover@@ nor Justice &apos;s announcement is only the last rejection of a party which is from above to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , im@@ it@@ ating message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC leader Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing scandal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as a clear excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed again .
Russian athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have been caught in competition for gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e to the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been achieved , but Congress supports the recommendation of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships , starting on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funeral &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Mali crashed soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot;
during a funeral service in the North Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Minister of Defence Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to be un@@ explained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice that they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ dor@@ tmann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as the politics began .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wedding guests laid down roses , the relatives were arm in arms in the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen described the opposite soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff has built up the flight operation of the helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no doubt about the UN mission in Mali : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was announced by the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for both .
the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , he continued to read it .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also de@@ ferred the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Con@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish king &apos;s house , declared .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be settled in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked at the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were always f@@ lown , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand in his almost 50 years reign .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of knit@@ ting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , but does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , he spoke for the resolution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprise of a Green Party member from their state parliament in Lower Saxony over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the state election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
El@@ ke T@@ ests , former Green Party member , justified its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hannover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his Group to include them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
until now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be regularly elected on January 14 , next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government should now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Land Constitution also provides the opportunity for the country &apos;s parliament to trust the Prime Minister and elect a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be legally insp@@ ected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in peace , all questions are discussed if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something kur@@ i@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she referred to herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the rebel@@ li@@ ous parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their land daily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we , of course , assume that she has returned her country @-@ day mandate with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we greatly regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over@@ step of the Lower Saxony Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ jackets to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
leaving T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its latest vanity and fru@@ stration , the politicians point out their personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony particip@@ ates in this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to beat it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CD@@ U .
the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed T@@ v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with a personal career .
at that time the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the country &apos;s day .
Minister of Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ yers , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder provide the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all we know at the moment , a health hazard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has opened up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concerns .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has the same concern as manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are traffic @-@ capable and safe to health .
if the residual sugar content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
in accordance with the current state of knowledge , production plants do not meet any direct guilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to alleged illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always , there are too little inspec@@ tors in the case of serious emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is there only lacking in personnel or at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
it is precisely this reason that a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be present are of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm system really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and traffic @-@ capable food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are rightly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ou@@ tra@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by means of the company , manufacturers , distributors and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in general , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supplying animals cannot be tolerated and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are solved quickly and comprehen@@ sively .
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expenditure of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to the French @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G must at some point prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can make money easy with security so that N@@ ey@@ mar sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team due to the energy @-@ rich royal family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to counter@@ act legitimate income sources that enable them to break even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ked to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from the concentration on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in favour of the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G pays the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract so that the revenue streams for the next five years will be reported in the annual financial statements of 4@@ 4.4 million euros .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has made the PS@@ G with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ an enterprise could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered a legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor@@ ship value of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could make payments to the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar will become World Cup ambass@@ adors and find such manoeu@@ v@@ res for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators simply to find out .
the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , but on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke on the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year still have to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and they tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new lap supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline will re @-@ write the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 17 million small white @-@ white , white @-@ white chocolate tons per year distribute the flight atten@@ dant before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs .
insi@@ der insi@@ der estimates the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate producer it is a prestigious contract .
Swiss will not want to give away how many applicants are interested in the new tender .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a position .
Swiss have been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006 .
before signing a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class with goo@@ dies are spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class gymnas@@ tics passengers scho@@ gg@@ i of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y also distri@@ butes on the short circuit , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes to the niche in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot;
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter turned the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for promising lots of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by spinning on the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play awesome children who will grow up - they nevertheless managed to get the im@@ possibility to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who are now adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the watering can principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s , like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious plot , included in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the courses are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s mou@@ sta@@ che of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels now like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could heat up this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches that which I perceive as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ west ring combat icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic is@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are du@@ bbed in English .
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - among them J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask - that it often plays like a single one .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited down to a lesser length could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police managed to strike a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office announced on Friday .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued warran@@ ts for arrest .
in addition , the civil servants established large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
in the case of time @-@ like ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Maf@@ ia &apos;s members are accused of organised crime crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office Kon@@ stanz has been investigating the organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the Grand Master was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
in particular , Italian citizens with a close relationship to the Italian ma@@ fia came to the fore of the investigations .
also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank &apos;s bank account .
Weise lam@@ ents large gaps in the for@@ eigner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not emerge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions regarding asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the representative for refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has pointed out large gaps in the country register register .
defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may lead to some serious wrong decisions in cases of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , in a manner similar to the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the data , 10 million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because data has not been sufficiently well maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the Register any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can significantly slow return processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included who would not have to travel at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false assur@@ ances led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families to Italy with children under 16 years old when they have arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it is said that BA@@ MF will carry out such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper posted a reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first achieve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ g@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children are threatening human rights ab@@ uses and a threat to child welfare because of the defici@@ encies in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood of persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now donated 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our body is laid out for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , not self @-@ serving , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Regional Director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned food is de@@ composed into its constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could profit from a blood donation .
at the same time Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently the change in the theatre house led to higher attendance figures a few years ago .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ bert were among the multiple don@@ ors and awarded 50 blood donations for 50 years .
half as many people book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ ere , Stef@@ an@@ ie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation damp@@ ened speculation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of intensified pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members striving for an increase in weak economic growth .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget revenues would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alized that interest increases would be needed in the next few years to infl@@ ate the inflation @-@ induced inflation and she said that the loan costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut stimulus package published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of February , although it has been said that now it is expected to provide $ 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forec@@ asting of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the interest rates it was repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; extent than the markets expect .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecast for this year and next year will rise by 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared with the forecast predicted in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell on these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
no change will be made after the recent disap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations for interest rate rise and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening of inflation is getting worse at first before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the income gap , but she added that wages will recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumer spending .
the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the spark of the spark .
the Bank estimates it will likely take four years until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rate rose because inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , while three polic@@ y@@ makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected to attract it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the excess in relation to its goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as credi@@ tors want to look lou@@ dly at businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing dealers exp@@ ire and fin@@ alise the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with due @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) urged to prescri@@ be a controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will have access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the High Court in September following a fight against the funding of the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that a preventive pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered from the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) called this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable people to register and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a sequence of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in risk of infection .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
suitable participants are identified in clinics that agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not well known through anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive purchase .
the study aims to assess the overall potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence as it is used and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , if directed specifically to needy and endangered people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled individually and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV will be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect individuals who are HIV infected , and that it will contribute to ending the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced himself to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
this was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the Archit@@ ec@@ tural and Design Studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed von Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the requirement .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed over each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored in order to let it work for a longer time .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units provide space for all h@@ edges and j@@ ars by Jo@@ anne .
due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very important so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the bottom size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , they have managed to increase the floor space while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of some standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for $ 500 million in real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an examination of one of the largest real estate @-@ empire Vic@@ tori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De LU@@ TI@@ S &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; described in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul approximately one third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in has property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and has a value of $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first affir@@ m@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 .
last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early affir@@ m@@ da@@ v@@ it filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance states that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with affir@@ m@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ it@@ te , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ ads of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began West co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often told me he never wanted the brothers to land before the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S Group , with Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ held himself very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Chief of Staff Tr@@ ump plans to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that the White House Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information that was put into the hands of the president .
Kelly told the staff that information should flow over him - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diagnose makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ umps relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was upset because of unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping the Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaigns officials there is to ensure that personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter habit has ever been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know about others - that , without their interventions , Tr@@ ump@@ et T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more combus@@ tible material .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his colleagues manage to keep anger away from him a few times , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has been able to consistently prevent Tr@@ ump controversi@@ es .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May of advis@@ ing the advis@@ er to the president for strategic reasons to provide doub@@ t@@ ful information .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone mal@@ ici@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the internet provo@@ cat@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Stab@@ s@@ ef@@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he spoke wrong accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police all over Europe are sending postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
since the addresses of the searched heavy criminals are naturally not known , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the campaign which follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience had shown that a lot of fle@@ ec@@ es were hiding in holiday destinations , was the name of Euro@@ pol .
I have put together 21 postcards for criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online rum@@ ours could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to clu@@ es after the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire range &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on the foot of the war who have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn from the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense units and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent away by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must indeed be forced to implement it as it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , moved forward and are back again .
more came last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instruction to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local charge if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inhabit@@ ant who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of this travel@@ er just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson for Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp in the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is being renovated and will be re@@ opened on March 1 , next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente operating company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the county office as an accommodation provider , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious potential buyers in the house .
he was to be right .
the Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els group with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt Object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ era and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance since a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single site .
there is still much to do by March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nicely bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
one does not want to position himself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city were identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
when it comes to investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to pin@@ point exactly .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external plants are also brought to front man , which is already clearly visible .
in an inner courtyard , there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the past weeks , the committee accepted the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller wi@@ dened and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there is already the first meeting of the Committee in connection with a meeting between the two grand@@ pumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Krem@@ lin to have targeted itself in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ump@@ et campaign team and Moscow .
the investigations will focus on several men acting in the election campaign as advis@@ er to the Republi@@ cans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took a close look at more and more tr@@ umps in the private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump has personally moved to the centre and investigate whether the president might have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether prosecution should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the counts of indictment .
mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge individuals for interro@@ gation under oath . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the CN@@ N station , invitations were issued that revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , it was said in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his chosen candidate , Paul Man@@ a@@ fort , were involved in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the implementation show that Mu@@ eller would not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment .
however , the sub@@ stitution of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President made use of a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else that they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
but this work usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this r@@ aus@@ ing , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become loud , he has hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June Com@@ ey said before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a hi@@ ring of investigations against the then National Security Ad@@ visor Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president is under great pressure for the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator and its employees .
this triggered speculation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was to be fired .
unlike an independent Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator of Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President &apos;s margins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented draft law on Thursday , according to which the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the western Antar@@ cti@@ ca , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been solved by the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
this was divided by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the large col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and probably will take two or three years until it melted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants registered in the last three decades .
there is no danger for human beings from him .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the break @-@ down of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research data .
in total , however , for about 30 years there have been a series of unusual occur@@ ren@@ ces of ic@@ eber@@ ry in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
as a result , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was dis@@ rupted a few years ago .
A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s there .
there is a lot to say that Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never pulled so far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece breaks at a key place .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice as much water as it emerges after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth @-@ largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with nearly 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and no direct link to climate change is aware of , the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wi@@ dest withdrawal since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists it is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow again or fall short @-@ term and possibly collapse , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not return to climate change this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg , many glaci@@ ers of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart during the last decades .
this long skirt of Antar@@ cti@@ ca stretches towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research programme , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been warming up around three degrees in the past 50 years , counting it to the areas in which the temperature rises most rapidly .
CD@@ U wants to keep Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls for the employer to step out of the employer to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the chal@@ k @-@ day has penet@@ rated 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first day of work behind them .
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are obviously highly cov@@ eted .
around 6@@ 20 applications were available for the places to be distributed this year .
nevertheless , the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is said to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate scar@@ city .
the overall concept should be oriented towards internal and external , point out concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to deal with personal problems that you did not know before .
other cities attract good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this results in a high number of employees leaving the service of disease or age related to age .
the highest time for action so that there are no more jobs left un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , group leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he took care of a bad surprise in the chal@@ k @-@ day , when he questioned the labor cost cap publicly and star@@ tled the rest of the parties .
nations would like all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county government should strive with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a house rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better for employees and officials than it is to pay for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are now exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available when you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone for NGO migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that made illegal immigration easier .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations currently being collected after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that its crew takes on board ding@@ h@@ y migrants , which are delivered directly by men &apos;s dealers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ riding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board , who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks , which meant that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who have left these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for touring .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
look@@ out points followed , partly on towers , from which one could see far over the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely longer asc@@ ents , for which long tri@@ als were p@@ opp@@ y .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , a view point to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ e cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ ation .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ers for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium r@@ att@@ ling during wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ its included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 followed and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire entirely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are still some clubs going on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal flag to Asia .
what exactly is it about ?
during e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA football simulation are challenged at a competitive level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since established itself in which the pros compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games in 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ann also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical responses , which can also be found in classic sports - for example elevated heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction ability .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the fit@@ te player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
the players are traveling internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by Del@@ o@@ it@@ te and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years turnover is expected to be 130 million .
this is little about the 2.4 billion Euro for the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ it@@ te consultants write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries have already been around the world .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe as well .
e @-@ sport has been introduced as a teaching subject in a Norwegian school , says F@@ rob@@ ann .
in the Netherlands and in France , the soccer league clubs , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in European comparison Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall into nostal@@ gia and to clarify old times is not enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time in the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only in football everything stays as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced Con@@ rad Roy to suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for negli@@ gent murder by Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until the appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ended his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said that it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which she depl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read an explanation from Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; there is no day in which I do not smoke the loss of my beloved Son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters despite all my pains that we will carry for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not having this single person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Car@@ ter &apos;s attention by the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit by any press from the case .
the case has shared legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ley : learning from the new mini @-@ lam@@ eness of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ y was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern has a big season for the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
something was different on his place in the cabin , Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ley saw immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very small .
but as far and broad@@ ly on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made his tie at his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as Bavaria captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 against SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach Kim@@ ber@@ y could point to me as well .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f existing from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from holiday professionals , but he .
sugar is best distributed to those who use a lot of ingredients to keep you in a mood .
so those who have been chosen to embar@@ k on the legacy of Lah@@ ner can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ ber@@ y confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old entered the field as a mini @-@ lam@@ eness .
to the right back , that is his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did the remainder .
and at all Kim@@ ber@@ ley worked in this initial formation as the one who can take the helm in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ recorded trou@@ pe .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal was trying to re@@ play his missing fitness ( just folded ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ che thus reli@@ ed on the accompli@@ sh@@ ments of the Asia trip ( folded only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not have a negative impact in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ ber@@ ley , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli whi@@ rl@@ wind was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried to succeed in playing the game a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as good as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game relo@@ cation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual as this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in connection to the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not have one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ ber@@ y said goodbye to his new fellow players after a couple of cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it often proved irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is shown after more than a year when the new Minister of Economic Affairs , Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously bl@@ ur the old minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bis@@ sing gras@@ ps the wishes of the economy which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us sees the biggest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the ministry hopes to establish a planning procedure until 2021 is to be the construction law .
the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier also plays a role in the country &apos;s plans , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan .
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says ministry spokes@@ woman Cor@@ nel@@ ia Hol@@ tmann .
nat@@ us sees this as a sign@@ post to support regional but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( Chamber of Commerce ) , Trier , asp@@ ires to be inspired by Wis@@ sing , while wine is a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports since 10 years .
in addition , bis@@ sing has an open ear for people wanting to establish their own company , the Chamber pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1,000 euros is fores@@ een for the passed master check and 2500 euros if graduates within ten years after the master &apos;s training become independent .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction makes it easy to create facts , at the same time out of the country by the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , head of the Chamber of Industry of the Chamber of Commerce in Trier .
up to now , only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ bis@@ sing in the state @-@ owned business .
the Chamber calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
s &amp; D vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros less than suggested by country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us expects a concept of the country as to how it intends to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
furthermore , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is sober@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had only assessed the supply of power in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and out@@ breaks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex @-@ Minister for Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where , after four months of dis@@ agreements , they already cleared the field .
Audi should change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW told BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW president said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des emit@@ ting diesel engines are considered to be carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the costs of the automobile manufacturers to install systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust gases emit@@ ted by diesel vehicles also accept what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of rob@@ bing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
companies are trying to avoid the faults of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes propor@@ tionally to Volkswagen &apos;s profits .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft will pass through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if you go to the Is@@ ar again on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the Construction Department wants to clarify .
a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent can be seen on the raft .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a protected ven@@ ison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , the raft passed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a ru@@ th@@ less and environmentally conscious behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ dil@@ los &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the laughter against the suffering &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most published cartoon characters , the ni@@ b@@ n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still standing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the 1960s , following stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again , the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures fro@@ ze in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks continue to find its dro@@ l@@ ly figures worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series for six years with his figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main character in the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - the most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come on the screen in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wor@@ rying .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining due to the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and because of the diseases transmitted insects , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert from the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ch@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that tran@@ sm@@ its the d@@ warf c@@ ads , and in very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary this year .

the murder of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ za usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars .
but that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office that were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutral ones , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to submit percep@@ tions and ab@@ domin@@ als .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll list or car@@ tels , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there are no rest periods of violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are growing , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under protection and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her publisher and her inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ za , the co @-@ founder Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep even though his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the odo@@ si@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the 1930s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der &apos;s Office was established in 2010 , in order to process the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely tried in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ za they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ consol@@ able and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ itors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we all di@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ za in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was fired on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people are shot on the streets or that the cemetery is full of adorned , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms , which are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a car@@ tel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes to the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ za , broke with the blame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
at first there was in February the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival car@@ tel groups in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , suspected aisle members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was that Val@@ dez did not force him to leave the country for his own safety after confis@@ cation of another newspaper published in the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ za and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to handle .
eight years after the founding of the company , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award by the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever she led .
he gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ za team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could curse like a port worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is his love for routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not permitted , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ odo@@ za Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happens with Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ za met for safety training , suddenly there were no cell phones allowed . days before it was known that spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ za in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the police officers whom the governor himself was not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters went to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ za has written three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous bo@@ xer Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to state expendi@@ tures , which focused on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducted a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) which ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ bre cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
just a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
journalists all over the country have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the murder of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth .
since then , she has asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a ceiling with organized crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as car@@ tel : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones lay beside her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug car@@ tels with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug trafficking was frigh@@ tened of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and so I became a re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ za sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to h@@ um .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ en@@ riv@@ als and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of car@@ tel em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ za about their mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are waiting nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept guard to see if they were ready .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ za followed his footsteps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid predat@@ ors
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; researchers have now found that the initial findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ oses of a Canadian min@@ er have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the round@@ about between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well maintained condition has star@@ tled researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he mined at the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy soil .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you b@@ link only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant e@@ ater , although covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , is probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a par@@ agli@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ protection , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to get better in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now visible in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ ors over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ aded , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ aded - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r shows how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on clu@@ es about his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Süd@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but is preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early chal@@ k time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the King of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six @-@ ton@@ ne heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he mined at the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the world &apos;s best preserved din@@ osau@@ r , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that were resting on his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were washed by Western Canada until a flooded river floo@@ ding into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cut@@ ters cover still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that bear the skull of the animal .
his right front foot lies on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
a heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles long stem and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) on the late Thursday afternoon , about 20 people were injured at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
after the first indications of the police , about 17 : 00 a.m. between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into each other .
there are no indications of the exact number of injuries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of light to medium @-@ sized injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the driving direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer long back@@ rest was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it was also on the opposite way to massive obstruc@@ tions - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade noted the characteristics of the car drivers , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ish@@ ments .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing can be seen in the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ ers .
does the conductor come and w@@ akes up an uns@@ ung or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by mobile , that you take your seat and use it to de@@ grade the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be available on many other long @-@ distance routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train ticket de@@ valuation without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do .
it also has to be purchased via the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customer then appears as a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that Pass@@ enger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
if the train atten@@ dant arrives at number Y at ticket inspection , he knows that a passenger sits there with an already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
the check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to relax without a ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , simply check out the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marketing Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who run the train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest nu@@ is@@ ances .
because often you have , in any case , one of your fellow travellers not all the documents you need to vali@@ date online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you have to pay is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , resulting in poor mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling their own ticket and taking the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and this applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rell has been shocked to its core on 9 August 2014 .
just one day after arriving in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still on the road &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she joined Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the handle @ the@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ arded on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she set off her cell phone to return to twe@@ ets about people on Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns father , who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ uson &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman w@@ aked his gun and scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ uson the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ uson is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the age of 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance which consists in the sight of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rell , with her daughter , carrying a flower dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ uson , the two discussed a conversation that they had numerous times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alled what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ uson because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to be free to free ourselves .
even though I am fortunate enough to give her an experience where she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was President of the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black congreg@@ ations .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell arrived during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community prof@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We had heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson have not centered their votes and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell to the project , along with six other natives , followed the team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brow@@ ning &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are portrayed , because so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ara &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result documents of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life , as she falls in love with and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have shaped the movie &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ tive type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell has been selected as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was in front of the front , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , F@@ erg@@ uson news cameras have long since disappeared , but the rac@@ ist connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ uson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss about Bit @-@ Galerie &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bit Gallery moves people even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been split@@ ting the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the subject is hardly cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one at the Bit Gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; del@@ usion ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents are building a gallery attracting more customers to the city , of which the other businesses benefit , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct ble@@ eds .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work it will be finished .
the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - with the possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; we have been in the farmers market almost every week for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women always very happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there is also in other cities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is moving in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the new project will probably not be very low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think that &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of this in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that we get at least the market hall .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive above all .
as you can see , shops are rented in a shopping center only by larger companies , because the hi@@ es there are often not wear@@ able for a retailer .
too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall be located during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .
or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to exp@@ el all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that stands empty doesn &apos;t need anybody .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer a place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after publi@@ cally classified diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a fitting resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and away dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
by algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , though somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the for@@ mb@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations against the pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits clearly un@@ comfortably on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette stu@@ b and chew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became un@@ equal glasses , which exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the president would convert Chel@@ ny &apos;s judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama actually was just a few days after the book was published , forcing Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and heavy at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths to further infl@@ ame the rigid circuits he should actually solve .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things could happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Mann@@ ing asked with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respect , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective it are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the comic @-@ novel mentioned above .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ free phone in the hands of the United States &quot; disciplinary powers such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they are cold , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as predicted in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , which are like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also aimed at how everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , with which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that stuck behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide human race is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Administration states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them should now be judged and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter examined by the relevant authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are willing to help US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Administration , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said he insisted upon the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that lay and war@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand Plaza management team has published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background , resear@@ ching a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ KA@@ D ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ introducing R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t have anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged government sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are conducting the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has caused a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with Russian sales outlet r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov answered problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was ruled out in November 2015 in the wake of the dop@@ ing scandal of WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ KA@@ D ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
they divided the Group &apos;s groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion that could not be preceded by any health impairment , it was said in the message .
from now on only eggs are expected to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested neg@@ atively on the fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ant anti @-@ lice agent .

start @-@ ups that will help your business not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck at your e @-@ commerce startup , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce hair care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called out people from the outside for help .
a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is on guard to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software , which has the specific purpose of measuring staff commitment , it allows companies to address surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups , staff anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she got a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the S@@ nap Sur@@ veys and P@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company , which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which leaders have low approval results - so that you can re@@ boot , why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber wrapped in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance Industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the Financial Market Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line where employees can report bad behavior .
and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that does not treat its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it may experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by executives who have been sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ ships .
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed for ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as service , and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that supports Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of firms such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
g@@ lit@@ ters secured $ 10 million in November from B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their workplaces than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices heard , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if third @-@ party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
in fact , when a company asks associates after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ v@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that rely too much on gathering data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you will not follow your fellow workers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T .
and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond between employees in an industry that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some with@@ drew their jer@@ sey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer classes will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three @-@ hour practice before returning to the water man Football Center in the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the pre @-@ packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood carried out practical exercises .
20 days before starting the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on her three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they plac@@ ate on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear sight@@ lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been ki@@ cked with foot@@ balls , which is a protective grid behind a door@@ post , no easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set themselves there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports from third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network said on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fak@@ es that may show results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to be punished after social media networks if they do not succeed in quickly eradic@@ ating hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday Facebook told in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts verification will be launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to finding which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger days , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has lived 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ fully . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the Edward era and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotion@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
and letters always smell smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten up with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ valued my welcome greeting &quot; ) seems to be all too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ enas on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the area and the ruins of the old castle , and talked with fellow country@@ men , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust only received full access in 2006 than the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent who owned : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let everything go his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to explore the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ ghtly Fam@@ ous of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are connected with one another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ cher , which the family Dar@@ rell has hidden for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell is depicted in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug up ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be a ga@@ unt@@ let , always making debts and spending money for things that they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men rede@@ emed their debt crisis by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se Er@@ binnen . &quot;
after the end of his deployment in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ kel@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a mor@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle is covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the cover of the 30@@ 1 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team led by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday .
at the end of August , there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an omni@@ present promise , one that gives the city a unique selling point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is competing with other local authorities .
the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ fifth figure for its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ re@@ es and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in Turkish forces one year after the attempted coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the general staff , as formerly , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister .
the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs Minister also took part in the deliber@@ ations under the head of the Prime Minister .
as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in excess .
the government tigh@@ tens the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the clin@@ cher of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the repe@@ al of the tu@@ b@@ ish ban on female soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the large @-@ scale cleaning of the army and security forces continues .
in the middle of July , Erdo@@ gan was firing another 73@@ 95 civil servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered to be the lords of the country .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least under appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is specifically driving an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an especially not@@ orious officer , who sought asylum after the attempted coup attempt , sought asylum abroad , the Turkish army would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that is true , such a development could not leave Nato cold .
in the alliance after the pur@@ ges there are doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he fores@@ ees the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way citizens are issued from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to rehabili@@ tate route for race @-@ up shuttle
over and over again , over the past few months , the future of racing platform sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it is expected to go very quickly .
even before the end of the year , it is supposed to be built on the ailing road on which the tourist railway runs .
in order to secure the future of race @-@ up sh@@ utt@@ les in the long run , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work on the track will begin again this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue ordering and renov@@ ating the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this especially important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Deputy Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the track rose to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country assumes 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , will be decisi@@ vely coordinated , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the ministry and the Southern Thurin@@ gia railway as the operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the racing stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle should be ordered regular in December 2017 .
the racing stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a railway link popular among tourists between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the course of a pilot operation , in the course of a pilot operation , it has been tested whether the route is used by a sufficient number of people to re@@ order them regularly in the future .
in addition , the route is strongly b@@ auf@@ äl@@ lig in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it won &apos;t be cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , in fact .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , a professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we &apos;ll see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey when he released his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot to his convi@@ ctions and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing as many robots possess the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed to conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female qualities , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , rest@@ less one the most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no ro@@ xx@@ x@@ ies ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their development and increasing refin@@ ement point to something ha@@ ze and deeper in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their growing popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened world @-@ wide , in which there is a president in the White House who bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the eng@@ ul@@ fed bodies and the daughter &apos;s eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as possible ( even with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : ma@@ ids
pumps great power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of man
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized US elec@@ torate must have split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump sel@@ ectable relatives .
we all seem to force ourselves all to burst our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ umps to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet living in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite stran@@ gely on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is in a further context that this also brings considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his bi@@ b will no longer meet us any more .
however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans norm@@ alize the right wing &quot; which suddenly appears as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today I find myself surrounded by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ comic version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur to be a very mild off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immense improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of New York &apos;s park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals twist in order to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ mati@@ sing music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disap@@ point : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact no Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience since two two @-@ year @-@ olds , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on and have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked them afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street , it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this does not only result in slow@@ ing down what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic , while I was tired of having the experience to extend my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of car@@ ving , according to a case in his cell , according to the prison authorities .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to death for murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der that hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say that she is too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National Court of Prosec@@ ution said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us risks that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

she wished everyone four @-@ leg@@ ged friend to feel accepted in his new school .
thank you to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps back to teaching bott@@ len@@ ecks and the parents &quot; representatives .
the cooking time is over now , explained teacher Sophia Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , they left their students very reluct@@ ant because it was a really great time .
finally , they have been able to rely on the tet@@ ra@@ wat@@ ter .
at the end , all students made a song of summer time and holiday time .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ time students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained in Greece because of illegal camping , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally ro@@ oting people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and put on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission characteristics of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates negotiated are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the next few months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler announced to write every person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within the framework .
how long should the conver@@ sions be drawn up altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the curtains depend on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be more time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would consult , so S@@ met@@ anin .
does a massive fall in price of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threaten ?
the ACE fears this .
but just in the regions where driving b@@ ans are threatening .
in rural areas there has so far been no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE advises to wait for a sale .
ll Cool J awarded Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
this year , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the honored guests this year .
the awards are presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with a progressive TV series already announced to abst@@ ain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ sts me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tr@@ ump to make her point clear .
the Kennedy Center , named after the former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ el@@ ch Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will be in R@@ ente next year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been the city building master for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press talk .
he reports of varied but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has been submitted to the requirements profile so far .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - taking into account the regular periods of notice - should still be enough time for a famili@@ arization .
since Has@@ lach acts as a lower property authority for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant has to present relevant degrees to the applicant .
for this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could no longer fill them out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the proximity of the city is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere and good mood between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot are initiated .
the zig@@ z@@ ag between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will fight with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is much room for manoeu@@ vre in the city .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gardening , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the creation of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the Old Town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have an eye for what fits &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring city building master emphas@@ ises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has a high level of responsibility anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for ten years , Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been involved in the treatment and coordination of Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for the past 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains for a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , you should have a completed academic degree or a b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s degree in the field of architecture according to the town of Has@@ lach and have good knowledge in the fields of construction and planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt comprises high and civil engineering , construction planning , underground renov@@ ations , management of urban properties , urban depot with building yard and urban gardening and underground building protection authority including historic monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : South railway track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike on the lines of the railway track transfer in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these have been so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night .
close to the crime scene witnessed a pink sco@@ oter and a bike rider .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a field of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch for the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the killer or the perpet@@ rator would have brought themselves into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay of minutes and the costs of rail transport , P@@ ön@@ alen of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , to go out of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south railway track could be managed without any obstruc@@ tions .
nearly ten passenger trains arrived on Friday morning , two of them concerned the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the inc@@ urable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and in Great Britain 300@@ ,000 causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance tends too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes less inflammatory bow@@ el movements if the same system also acts with people .
the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was accommod@@ ated separately , did not .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced in DNA and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transmitted small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active ingredient was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as in@@ tra @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potential high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ces in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , after the mid @-@ field player had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holding role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted another three more commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
how the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
only there was no fire from the party headquarters , merely a counter@@ wind from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the election fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have been monitoring the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were set@@ backs .
and one after another .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows that red @-@ green is simply not reliable to go@@ vern , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber on Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the election of the country , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German managing director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the back@@ sliding Lower Saxony Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ ests to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and election campaign manager of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election winner sigh@@ s when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is on the ver@@ ge of over@@ stepping the green de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est to the CD@@ U without its own government majority .
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD regional associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades cal@@ med themselves at the time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
then it became - and indeed everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into stagn@@ ation , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te cut the party smoothly .
comrades , in the weeks after that , the comrades ra@@ ged .
then , when they had just hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next deep @-@ blow .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD country chief , lost his nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town burned .
and because in crisis communication he made quite wrong about what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhau@@ sts and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese Survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of that , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the federal government in recent weeks .
the aspir@@ ation of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained un@@ concealed by comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty on the internal party of the Lower Saxony Green Party .
and Schulz did not at all .
for the time being , the comrades endeav@@ oured to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here , above all , to the rebel@@ li@@ ous Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic as Mrs. T@@ ests puts her own career prospects on the interests of all the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ est is not elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but has been elected to the parliament by the state list of the Lower Saxony Green Party , according to the Lower Saxony parliament .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , compla@@ ins that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ v@@ res &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters four years ago were clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career prospects of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties will fal@@ si@@ fy the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments by the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding for the town center III
anyone who wants to be able to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development were in a sense on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review of what has happened so far .
since 1991 , there has been a lot of refur@@ bish@@ ment areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg has taken over two thirds of the funding sum .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is important to promote the development of the interior and not only to open up new building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , I received the information from the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500@@ ,000 euros came from the country , the rest from the municipality .
how is a rehabilitation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area to san@@ e .
if necessary , the area borders could then be postpon@@ ed again .
the pier represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal program in which the rehabilitation would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per property .
the rehabilitation area would eventually be defined as a by@@ laws .
the approval period for the funding will continue since January 1 , 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , the survey would be carried out only once , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area , a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the sentence will be carried out as soon as possible , so that the rehabilitation can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that every municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations .
it is a matter of evaluating the urban conditions and deciding when to renov@@ ate and to what extent .
for the respective property there will be a mem@@ orand@@ um of refur@@ bish@@ ment in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to the senses and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ h stressed that the project was a key success factor for the project .
therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and real estate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it works , among other things , about the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information on size , layout and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if the premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to be aware , God pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for subsidies .
in addition , new building measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - who comes first , first ad@@ mon@@ ishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t reserve funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to those present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets himself a micro@@ chip in order to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ es@@ thes@@ ist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now incorporated both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the cost of advertising of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military that has been left to TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the Connec@@ ti@@ cut helicopter was exhibited next to a Ma@@ ine yacht , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire bri@@ gade and a forkli@@ ft made from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn event at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning on July 17th and stayed for so long until the lawn was ev@@ acu@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump has conducted an investigation in February when the presidential aer@@ op@@ lane made an investigation against the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that are compla@@ ining about the use of the presi@@ dency by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thrilled by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Vice @-@ President of White House Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights around Washington and South La@@ wn to dep@@ ose US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was the training requirement of the crew crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting out the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget@@ ary records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a 2015 RA@@ ND study , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokesman of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to emphasize this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
runner @-@ up of the second tennis division of the German Tennis league will take place in the stand@@ alone S@@ V .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ellen@@ istic third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the runner @-@ up of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga has received the sense of reality .
at any rate , Team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team always playing quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the S@@ V Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high North are primarily concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to missions in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören und Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is practical .
his debut for blue wh@@ ites could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
if the Fren@@ chman , who is currently active in the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian bi@@ ella , does not succeed in the Bundes@@ liga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) play at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first mission this season .

he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move into the team .
if it is not enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Juni@@ ors World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the coach of Mari@@ us Z@@ ay does not fill the cad@@ res .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Congress a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the U.S. advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the Austrian O@@ MV , which together with other European companies co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Care Nord Stream 2 , are accordingly troubled .
the dr@@ one setting is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such is the official statement of the oil corporation .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump even would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer reveals , the Net@@ fli@@ x series is not over yet .
the relay three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bad@@ dies of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organisation of the world &apos;s drug trade : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kar@@ tell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only operate with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the car@@ tel , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York .

roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in urban day@@ care centers the clock is turned back .
on September 1st the town of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the urban children &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) once more in self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all were very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh water cooled .
in the Kre@@ feld area , the city operates 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last kit@@ a@@ year , 28@@ 00 children each sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are taken care of 45 week@@ days at the K@@ ita in the afternoon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay until 14 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 partial @-@ time employees have kitchen service from 1 September : they heat the cooked food , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , clean up , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ class facilities - decides about the ho@@ ur@@ ly rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen workers are now firmly part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has found itself in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and external distribution for the city as the most economical one , it means from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time employees are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong for some 750 people in the education area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all the members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , head of the United Nations mission , said hundreds of women elected in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible when women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year , elections for the first time will be delivered peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

men try to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends on the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2 : 55 a.m. , because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpetrators tried to use the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , which , however , failed .

the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow factory in the case of managers from the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which , besides other products , produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested over $ 5 million in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s head office , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie called on &quot; expressing concern that funding for modernis@@ ation of production lines should not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we are not able to gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned with our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the Glasgow Greater Region , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
one speaker of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross had received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and in@@ secure business climate , continually review our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - to stay competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production . if our operations at the site change , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga likes to regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not abandon N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after having issued an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million in order to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the World War ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board is insi@@ sting that the club has always tried its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but did the football world have been warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President in front of this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for each club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to make one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , where the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the start of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter kno@@ cked up and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ rator intentionally over@@ threw a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage of over 200 euros in the disgu@@ ise of the vehicle .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone number 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for hints .
the police witnesses for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to ev@@ ade a car in his lane and tou@@ red the guard rail .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction to Le@@ ese .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane so that he had to move to the right .
in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the guard rail .
there was a kind of damage to the passenger car .
the driver of the incoming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had passed a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident , it can be good that the motor car driver had not noticed the accident at all .
the police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the judgment vehicle to contact the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au at tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann says .
the final report on the mis@@ use scandal among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained after publication against the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would be very useful to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then wrong evaluation of the events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critici@@ zed that reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the interference in Regensburg no one doubts that it is about &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you like to go to the church and that &apos;s a glut@@ ton@@ ous fres@@ her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows had been a normal pedago@@ gical remedy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with fre@@ ak@@ y children , just as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of mis@@ use cases , Pope @-@ Brother George R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ aman , who wrote the souvenir sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he analyses the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber of the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of ass@@ aults , 67 domains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by R. Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was even more violent .
in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even have positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use scandal of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pre@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence Ex@@ erc@@ ises in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who has become hand @-@ gr@@ asp@@ ed when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has not brought top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as its bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all present in it .
there are eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also occurred outside of its sphere of influence .
at best , one can repro@@ ach him , experience it too late , or to have taken first hints not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gym@@ nasi@@ um gym@@ nasi@@ um on which he worked was felt by virtually all inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also provides an excellent testimony , described him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and candy , and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ined about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high level of emotion@@ ality that led to rage .
the fact that he did not only kn@@ it with chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also distributed ear files and pulled too nau@@ gh@@ ty boys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his ret@@ ali@@ ation , however , it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the questioning time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um .
in comparison with what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , it is certainly Bag@@ at@@ ella .
one wonders whether it does not relate to his fame and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media have just r@@ ushed to him .
many who have never understood him at the Bavarian pop@@ e are still working eag@@ erly .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , a great deal was reported on the issue of abuse among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put in the final report also some involvement or co @-@ worker with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to be entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the affected person representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the cul@@ pr@@ its professionally .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a sought @-@ after pup@@ il put it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ rator .
I think it is absurd to assume that it is just absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ bs have more penet@@ rating or clearer or even more opened than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the pupils and / or their surroundings entrusted to him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to speak from any co @-@ worker .
so he cannot be accused of being prevented or brought to the display .
therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately occurred in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viol@@ ence Ex@@ cep@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read among the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Weg@@ row &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and bl@@ ended into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly the ab@@ uses of the report .
there is , namely , clean separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and , let us say , other alle@@ gations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
all the horrible investig@@ ative pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys from sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were regularly victi@@ mi@@ zed and portrayed , and who suffered horri@@ bly , all took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on that , as most witnesses stress , the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; conditions .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims estimate the general humanity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore , in many cases , even have positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , at most , the repro@@ ach remains to have looked away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then back in 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently hear the ears from the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , which even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even given the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when testing fin@@ es were also banned in Bavaria .
before that , they acquired themselves in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
it was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might over@@ drive or dramati@@ ze and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 , the sentence was officially aboli@@ shed in schools in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis maintained that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians talk about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the risk to evaluate the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess was right .
but this does not apply to sexual abuse which has been ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and also not for what was f@@ aded in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the practice of that time .
this is all aw@@ ful and I am happy that it will be re@@ worked .
but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , so to draw ear@@ fig@@ s and to the hair and ears , were widely used in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he was also strictly adher@@ ed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his contem@@ por@@ aries Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played in talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of testing also contribute to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told from his perspective that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not by any means forbi@@ d that he had a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this must also be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ condition@@ ally discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world music from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscuits and can@@ dies alone , you can &apos;t stand out of un@@ ru@@ ly boys once a great singer and before every success , whatever the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : due to the work in the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deep believing and heart @-@ good people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something for a fly .
I regularly get in touch with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his gradu@@ ation , visit him regularly , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who have not forgiven him until today , that he was once stern to them , are clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them the world of music to them .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ectable person to whom they still look and honor them .
and please , again quite clearly : everything that you repro@@ ach upon him is educational methods which were at the time of the day .
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that stands behind it , only too obvious .
the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the starting point would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
