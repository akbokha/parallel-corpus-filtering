<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A mine chapel, which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Munich's oldest official card encourages exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows everybody who had to be upset because the car navi was showing a green meadow instead of a strapping road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the Digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">More detailed maps, so-called document sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerische Verveying Authority between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Their client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, it was the neighbours of today who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph moved forward the project, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bayerische Verveying Administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "the" "" "Urpositional Sheet" "" "for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was registered 21 years after the map was created, thus 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when entering in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbers numbered from the so-called "original photograph" from which the land tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots today no longer occupy farmers, but small farmers in the plant" "" "Land in the Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienviese, the scene of the October festival in 1810, was indeed a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen, in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street names "on Gasteig" or "On the Lair," but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, people once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich County Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was established there." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the accusations of the so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the staff from using violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper Hospital Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in Munich's Salesianum are now on the grounds of the former Auer Institute.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west lies the football pitch of the TSV München, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was erected in architectural style reminiscent of the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "around 1856 and the Kaufingerstrasse was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the foremen and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn (urban rail) line will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union for the Promotion of Farmers issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory politics and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force by August 28, 2017, demands afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special care while travelling, as a number of questionable, racist-based incidents occur in recent times throughout the state and be noted here," "" "says the Group's comments." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "a recently adopted Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the state law enforcement authorities, who are disproportionately aimed at minorities, caused the group to issue the travel warning," "" "said the NAACP." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "" "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during his journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri General Prosecutor, which shows that black motorists in the state pay 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready if they bring Caution money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri posted 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which classifies the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profile.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherbach Weidezvous Project is a success project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of the Bundestag Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac received an image on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the right-wing court of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisherbach "CDU" association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 milk cows and also many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwald milk" "" "is the alternative marketing pathway for him for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengäste is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also chairman of BLHV-chairman of Fischerbach, he called the" "" "elementary importance" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot produce profitably on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area provides a lot of work, much has to be machined with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "" "Schwendemann emphasized." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not conduct bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad of the leader's support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "I hope that the afforestation of the areas could be drafted for quite a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and making thoughts about how they continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013 by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The conservation area is 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The total cost of 71 500 Euro was promoted by half over leader, one quarter bore the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers had to stay 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers it doesn't work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiss also stated: "here the best foods are produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Clearance Directive (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg enables the government to promote pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to hold the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "moreover, the fenced area must not be tractor-catchy (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fisherbach Weidezvaunching Project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 pitches, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The surface area is 35 hectares, with calculated costs for more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking off the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitters would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to go to a complete story about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to is later added and not part of the Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is perfectly right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, your afflicted masses who desire to breathe freely, the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made clear that these people were not welcome in Trumpet's US.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about America's meaning.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who chose to place their words at the base after her death - knew very well that she took up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a traditional visual representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone but rather an early neoconservatory to bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not lighten the road to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh has stumbled across something quite unusual.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative action of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, eleventful but hopeful people after long and often horrible voyages on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is a matter of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torches should not enlighten the way, but ignite the hatred that is their sole source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team.</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team for team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is quite modest." ""</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in the fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">"" "the mid-range" "" "Muir" "" "runs along this road and last year set up five British and two European records." ""</seg>

<seg id="149">Doyle remembers their first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "extremely proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also be part of the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>

<seg id="155">As for my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics about Facebook: don't mess around a public office if you can't tolerate the burning of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He shrugged in criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and dumb, we are led as sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it's a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and play his haunless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of persons coming to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum, which is considered officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hassery people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other up-to-date news," she wrote in the comments section of the message "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't value this idea either, if a number of people take a stand on the same topic, they are ignored by some more than a so-called collective commitment rather than a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor's employees referred to as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical control items, or to arrest and to silence protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what's going on digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question came last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County passed the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers slapped on its leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions criticized his position on the agreement of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain, overwhelmed his ministry, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="420">Elon Musk doesn't care: ten thousands of Tesla customers cancel order</seg>
<seg id="421">Electric-Tausendsassa Elon Musk gladly gives up with the huge number of reservations for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has so far underlined that a part of the customers have already retracted their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed a different, less dazzling number: that of the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk has often had over 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: of the 518,000 pre-orders 63.000 have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 Pounds) "Reservation Payment."</seg>
<seg id="428">Currently 45,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be rolled up - 500,000, by 2020 one million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are at present per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who orders a Model 3 today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines tested in practice without even greater interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states Scott Pruitt, Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of the state's environmental authorities as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint which was raised against his previous place in a Federal Court of Appeals.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is a time limit that ran for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone." ""</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the observance of a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecuted by President Donald Trump's Attorney General of Oklahoma for a long time, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly been forced to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA steward exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanlecks.</seg>

<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be indicted by activists and others, and agreed to set the deadline for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in legal proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>

<seg id="466">"" "750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the" "" "Bergkirche" "", "the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4: 30 p.m." ""</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promoters Tumlingens their request.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Schematic Editor: Count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church belonging to Tumlingen and the Vogtei by magic Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard to which the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today still can be seen in the town image of Tumlingen, the "Berg" of the third, the magnificent settling nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 are supporting these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage came from the early medieval property law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">It was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars existed in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two shattered on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the window panes were hammered and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were placed near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the present tower of Turmzwerg was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today, Horst Kallenar and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius-system as successor of Dieter Dockhorn as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, the friends and supporter Tumlingens invite to the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, 16 July.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "Hartmut Romann" "" "speaks the words." ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30.</seg>
<seg id="499">For the serenade of the Serenade, a trunk is placed in front of the churchyard.</seg>

<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large area.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity consumption of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this equates to approximately one fifth of the electricity demand of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Kreis Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="682">They work in several places in their Volunteer Year.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where to go everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in a piece of furniture in the furniture market, once a week I am here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at school in an open whole day.</seg>

<seg id="691">Lot: I did a high school diploma.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineer, let's say, successfully broke off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I recognized for myself that it is a wrong for me and I want to do something else, work with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what are you doing.</seg>
<seg id="695">Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it really is at the spot, at the focal point maybe also.</seg>

<seg id="697">Quantity: I have collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester.</seg>

<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works.</seg>
<seg id="708">Unlike in civil engineering studies?</seg>

<seg id="710">There are always other people who have a completely different story behind each other.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee or a teenager who has been fetched out of the family - you always have to respond to it individually.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And they had no reservations?</seg>
<seg id="714">Quantity: I'm not the guy for that.</seg>
<seg id="715">It is an area that gives a lot.</seg>

<seg id="748">In the end, the decision was clear: in two opposite voices, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winkler decides to set up a common room in the future seniors residence.</seg>
<seg id="749">Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property is signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.</seg>

<seg id="752">One of the two investors who are still in the boat offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the Municipal Council would not be able to foresee such a common space as a meeting place only for residents of the senient housing, but openly to the community.</seg>

<seg id="758">According to Tjaden, the establishment of a shared space would be capable of promoting 60 percent of 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="759">The proposal can be seen to signal the investor that in this respect he does not want to throw a billboard between the legs, the conclusion that the saddle - which is leaning against the surrounding area - as well as a desk roof - which reduces the pitch and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer believes this addition.</seg>

<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be kept.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the north side had a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons weighted so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a marginal fixing, which is also used as a way of operation.</seg>
<seg id="919">At the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway will be lost.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger firm Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">A special touch of intuition has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable that many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished first.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditure of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spain to the French-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the guiding organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">"" "" "" "financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG must at some point prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses." ""</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilians from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make money easy with security so that Neymar sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team due to the energy-rich royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but have to counteract legitimate income sources that enable them to break even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively fraudulent and risked to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from the concentration on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen in favour of the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to be deterred by excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG pays the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing on the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract so that the revenue streams for the next five years will be reported in the annual financial statements of 44.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has made the PSG with the heaviest sanctions together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a cataran enterprise could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the sponsorship value of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could make payments to the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and find such manoeuvres for the UEFA regulators simply to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The current sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG about Neymars transfer, but on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and they tried to prevent Neymars away by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>

<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>

<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-vicious plot, included in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the courses are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's moustache of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels now like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of accidental madness that could heat up this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches that which I perceive as his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon reminds of another kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-west ring combat iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic isosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are dubbed in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It's a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags for watching (the police spends the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent play 'Find out the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"comrade Detective," which was edited down to a lesser length could better deliver his Agitprop Satire because Gregor and Iosef continue to visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a money.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">This was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the Architectural and Design Studio Duck & Shed von Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked over each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored in order to let it work for a longer time.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all hedges and jars by Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a little bit of engineering went inside," "" "explained Erfan from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it's very important so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the bottom size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here, they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for $500 million in real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an examination of one of the largest real estate-empire Victorias worth more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De LUTIS's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" described in the De LUTIS family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul approximately one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin has property worth $316 million and has a value of $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in a first affirmdavit in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed placements, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - Colin, as Paul claims to have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affirmdavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance states that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages with affirmdavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood Property in which Colin opened the first Jeansads of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began West co there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often told me he never wanted the brothers to land before the court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS Group, with Colin claims that Mark has paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are," "" "Paul" "" "says" "" "bitter about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin withheld himself very much, although he was a former AFL member of the board and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin answered by SMS to say" "" "I can really not say much," "" "because the case is before the courts." ""</seg>
<seg id="1383">"" "" "" "it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and draw our surname by the courts," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">New Chief of Staff Trump plans to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reported that the White House Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that was put into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information should flow over him - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnose makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump was upset because of unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were convincing," "" "said the former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "she wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping the Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaigns officials there is to ensure that personal media consumption includes a steady lobbying." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps Twitter habit has ever been" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that, without their interventions, Trumpet Tweets would have included even more combustible material.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his colleagues manage to keep anger away from him a few times, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May of advising the adviser to the president for strategic reasons to provide doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press clippings, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he insists to find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the internet provocaturs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Stabsefin Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicans, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he spoke wrong accusations in the past and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is being renovated and will be reopened on March 1, next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente operating company ltd. on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the county office as an accommodation provider, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious potential buyers in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt Object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabera and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof there have been building shuttles in front of the entrance since a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were pulled out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do by March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's actually a lovely place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows will be installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">"" "everything should become" "" "nicely bourgeois" "", "as Thomas Scherer expresses." ""</seg>
<seg id="1466">"" "" "" "we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">One does not want to position himself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale inner city level, Scherer emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains Scherer further.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has already led talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The performances of the city were identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">When it comes to investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to pinpoint exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under one million euros, he reckons.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The external plants are also brought to front man, which is already clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In an inner courtyard, there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: U.S. Special Investigator sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigators Robert Mueller should have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "in the past weeks, the committee accepted the work, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "calling on people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller widened and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there is already the first meeting of the Committee in connection with a meeting between the two grandpumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin to have targeted itself in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumpet campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigations will focus on several men acting in the election campaign as adviser to the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took a close look at more and more trumps in the private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote several weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump has personally moved to the centre and investigate whether the president might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether prosecution should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called the counts of indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">"" "" "" "the committee can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge individuals for interrogation under oath." ""</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN station, invitations were issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, it was said in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumpet's advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his chosen candidate, Paul Manafort, were involved in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the implementation show that Mueller would not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the substitution of the Gremium is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President made use of a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the issue gives the democrats a way to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else that they can talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this work usually works in secret, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House endorses any action that accelerates the work of the special agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">There is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this rausing, accusations against Trump have become loud, he has hindered the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">In June Comey said before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him for a hiring of investigations against the then National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">"" "" "" "the president is under great pressure for the investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller was to be fired.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent Special Investigator of Congress, such as the Watergate affair around the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President's margins.</seg>

<seg id="1523">There is no danger for human beings from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the break-down of the iceberg is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, for about 30 years there have been a series of unusual occurrences of iceberry in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe, the balance of waxes and abruptions was disrupted a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete Schelfeis there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never pulled so far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece breaks at a key place.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it emerges after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth-largest ice shelf in Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and no direct link to climate change is aware of, the ice sheet is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the widest withdrawal since the beginning of the record," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists it is disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or fall short-term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not return to climate change this gigantic iceberg, many glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart during the last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been warming up around three degrees in the past 50 years, counting it to the areas in which the temperature rises most rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to keep Haustarif at staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls for the employer to step out of the employer to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the chalk-day has penetrated 41 new places in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 apprentices have their first day of work behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously highly coveted.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were available for the places to be distributed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are still 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann circle.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration is said to" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented candidate scarcity.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented towards internal and external, point out concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to deal with personal problems that you did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a real" "" "competition of the public employers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This results in a high number of employees leaving the service of disease or age related to age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">The highest time for action so that there are no more jobs left unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter peoples, group leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He took care of a bad surprise in the chalk-day, when he questioned the labor cost cap publicly and startled the rest of the parties.</seg>

<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we don't come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county government should strive with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - a house rate," "" "says peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU tries to pay better for employees and officials than it is to pay for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are now exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available when you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy sharpens the tone for NGO migrants' rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," "" "said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their crew worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that made illegal immigration easier.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organisation in an opinion on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only assess all accusations currently being collected after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes on board dinghy migrants, which are delivered directly by men's dealers, and that smugglers can depart so that ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board, who supervises their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring any" "" "essential changes or disabilities" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>

<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "in the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks, which meant that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit." ""</seg>

<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy Trials and sights for four days.</seg>

<seg id="1615">"" "" "" "this has also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this field." ""</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 followed and last the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent E-athletes under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal flag to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What exactly is it about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">During e-sport, computer games like "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the FIFA football simulation are challenged at a competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, Ligen has long since established itself in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games in 2022, e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it all about a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobann also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical responses, which can also be found in classic sports - for example elevated heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction ability.</seg>

<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of the diseases transmitted insects, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert from the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small chicade, a microbacterium that transmits the dwarf cads, and in very dry weather there are very many of it. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">"" "so we have fewer parts with essential oil." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoza usually meet Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office that were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutral ones, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to submit perceptions and abdominals.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's payroll list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no rest periods of violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are growing, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are under protection and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her publisher and her inspiration from Riodoza, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep even though his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the odosice building. two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder's Office was established in 2010, in order to process the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely tried in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoza they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more traitors.</seg>
<seg id="1825">"" "" "" "without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra." ""</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we all distrust everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoza in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was fired on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot on the streets or that the cemetery is full of adorned, two-story Mausoleums for drug kingdoms, which are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoza, broke with the blame that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first there was in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzmans's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have angered the sons, suspected aisle members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was that Valdez did not force him to leave the country for his own safety after confiscation of another newspaper published in the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues for the founding of Riodoza and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug drug problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of the company, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever she led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of CPJ recognition." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life" "", "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoza team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse like a port worker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Is his love for routine his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home" "" "runways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not permitted," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the" "" "Riodoza Andres Villarreal" "" "said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happens with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoza met for safety training, suddenly there were no cell phones allowed. days before it was known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoza in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the police officers whom the governor himself was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoza has written three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to state expenditures, which focused on the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) which ruled almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration in the morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists all over the country have become louder by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">Since then, she has asked her to be re-divided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and an indifferent society." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a ceiling with organized crime.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he mined at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy soil.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blink only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant eater, although covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, is probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a paragliding technique known as counter-protection, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to get better in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armors over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shaded, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shaded is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shaded - think of roe deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the chalk time," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on clues about his life, including his conserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as Südflorida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far more inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early chalk time." ""</seg>

<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six-tonne heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he mined at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that were resting on his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were washed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooding into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cutters cover still bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>

<seg id="1999">To be able to use them, however, some requirements have to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It also has to be purchased via the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>

<seg id="2004">The test customer then appears as a button for the electronic devaluation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companions get a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train attendant arrives at number Y at ticket inspection, he knows that a passenger sits there with an already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, work on, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn should use passengers.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those who run the train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest nuisances.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often you have, in any case, one of your fellow travellers not all the documents you need to validate online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you have to pay is missing.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, resulting in poor mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling their own ticket and taking the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of testers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance which consists in the sight of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell, with her daughter, carrying a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had numerous times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the proponents are building a gallery attracting more customers to the city, of which the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian precinct bleeds.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after publically classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (a fitting resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and away dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">By algorithmic analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the formbability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations against the pionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning sits clearly uncomfortably on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stub and chewing gum, extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice became unequal glasses, which exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a comic" "" "Suppressed Images" "" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the president would convert Chelny's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was just a few days after the book was published, forcing Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and heavy at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable paths to further inflame the rigid circuits he should actually solve.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things could happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Manning asked with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological respect, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective it are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2160">On Monday Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Administration states that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead, and detectives examine the stitches as murder while the police actively seek the two suspects, said officials.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbage, vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem should now be judged and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "this is now a criminal matter examined by the relevant authorities and the Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "" "said Cubbage." ""</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"" "a spokesman for the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that" "" "we are in contact with the police in Britain and are willing to help US investigative authorities in any way possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Administration, Anthony Guglielmi said he insisted upon the suspects to face the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "" "said Guglielmi." ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that lay and warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"" "" "" "we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "" "said Guglielmi." ""</seg>
<seg id="2179">The Grand Plaza management team has published an explanation to the residents: "the police are currently working on the timeline and the victim's background, researching a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"we will finish the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"" "" "" "in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2183">"" "the WADA roadmap was updated in this respect," "" "said Mutko on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re-introducing RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he doesn't have anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"" "" "" "everything has been announced, everything is being implemented." ""</seg>
<seg id="2187">"" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "" "he added." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list is that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged government sponsored doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "regarding the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has caused a mistake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "but there were no government programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutko's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with Russian sales outlet rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov answered problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, then added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "nobody has to accept this report unconditionally," "" "added Smirnov." ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was ruled out in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal of WADA by the implementation of doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After a visit to the headquarters of the organisation in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA moves "in the right direction" to be used again.</seg>

<seg id="2200">It was a mere precaution that could not be preceded by any health impairment, it was said in the message.</seg>
<seg id="2201">From now on only eggs are expected to be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negatively on the fipronilant anti-lice agent.</seg>

<seg id="2203">Start-ups that will help your business not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck at your e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was simply never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called out people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of human resources start-ups is on guard to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software, which has the specific purpose of measuring staff commitment, it allows companies to address surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups, staff anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she got a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap Surveys and Polls of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company, which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which leaders have low approval results - so that you can reboot, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber wrapped in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as GLINT, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance Industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the Financial Market Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, who helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent lets companies send "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline where employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that does not treat its employees badly or behaves unethical, it may experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, Convercent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a timidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by executives who have been sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group from Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as service, and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that supports Venture Capital Investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitters secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices heard, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Renditen when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and commitment to employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretaker of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks associates after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that rely too much on gathering data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you will not follow your fellow workers," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now runs monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bond between employees in an industry that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>
<seg id="2257">"" "" "" "and if you lose people, you also lose customers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts at 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players entertain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus.</seg>

<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should begin at 19: 15 to meet the pre-packed schedule of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood carried out practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">20 days before starting the formal game preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger days, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has lived 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says wistfully." ""</seg>

<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the Edward era and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>

<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten up with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overvalued my welcome greeting") seems to be all too nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled hyenas on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the area and the ruins of the old castle, and talked with fellow countrymen, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "Whiskey" "" "and began to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust only received full access in 2006 than the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, cards that represent who owned:" "" "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," "" "says Rhodes," "" "but there was a birch fighting for the two families." ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go his way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to explore the English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a riot that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled" Knightly Famous of Kent and Sussex, "Rhodes says.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good beginning.</seg>
<seg id="2313">"" "perhaps the two are connected with one another?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patcher, which the family Darrell has hidden for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggller Arthur Darrell is depicted in the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug up).</seg>
<seg id="2316">"" "the Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney:" "" "the gentlemen seemed to be a gauntlet, always making debts and spending money for things that they could not afford." ""</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell's men redeemed their debt crisis by marrying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys, with a talent to advertise Erbinnen. "</seg>

<seg id="2338">Each year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirees and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first sight a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine in Turkish forces one year after the attempted coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was no longer held in the building of the general staff, as formerly, but in the presidency of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">The five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs Minister also took part in the deliberations under the head of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2344">As a result, the civilians in the YAS were in excess.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government tightens the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the clincher of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara since this week.</seg>

<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unease in Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the repeal of the tubish ban on female soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the large-scale cleaning of the army and security forces continues.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In the middle of July, Erdogan was firing another 7395 civil servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan tamed the military.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it won't be crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we'll see them much more often," "" "said Mr. Sharkey when he released his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adapt" "" "his robot to his convictions and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing as many robots possess the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepford woman look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as good as possible," "" "enthuses True Companion's website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can be" "" "in the mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female qualities, the allusions to rape, when one goes one step on Frigid (i.e. here: resisting) Farrah, restless one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no roxxxies?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their development and increasing refinement point to something haze and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR noted their growing popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women's rights are threatened world-wide, in which there is a president in the White House who boasted to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most terrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphical images, the engulfed bodies and the daughter's eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible (even with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the language of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps great power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump-era that the political divisions that polarized US electorate must have split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump selectable relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all seem to force ourselves all to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet living in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strangely on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is in a further context that this also brings considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his bib will no longer meet us any more.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans normalize the right wing "which suddenly appears as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself surrounded by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur to be a very mild offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republican only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immense improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of New York's park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals twist in order to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatising music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage - the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park Karussell is still a strange magic experience since two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on and have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked them afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only result in slowing down what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologetic, while I was tired of having the experience to extend my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was brought to hospital for the treatment of carving, according to a case in his cell, according to the prison authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to death for murder following an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder that hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six-year custodial sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say that she is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Court of Prosecution said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius risks that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and in Great Britain 300,000 causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance tends too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"" "Professor Colonna said:" "" "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance." ""</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes less inflammatory bowel movements if the same system also acts with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was accommodated separately, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced in DNA and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transmitted small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as intra-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potential high tryptophances in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal among the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," explained after publication against the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then wrong evaluation of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticized that reporting on violence in the Domspatzen is measured with" "" "double standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the interference in Regensburg no one doubts that it is about "shameful and shameful deeds" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "you like to go to the church and that's a gluttonous fresher." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows had been a normal pedagogical remedy" "", "" "" "to be done with freaky children, just as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of misuse cases, Pope-Brother George Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesaman, who wrote the souvenir sheet" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "because all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he analyses the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber of the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plausibility" "" "victims of assaults, 67 domains." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by R. Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students was even more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to many other defendants, in contrast to many other defendants, many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even have positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "Precidents of Violence Exercises in the Regensburger Domspatzen" "", "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students emphasize his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who has become hand-grasped when a Domspatz has not brought top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all present in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">There are eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of complicity or co-operation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, one can reproach him, experience it too late, or to have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the gymnasium gymnasium on which he worked was felt by virtually all interviewees as" "" "redemption" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also provides an excellent testimony, described him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy, and "always surrounded by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high level of emotionality that led to rage.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only knit with chairs and threw the keys on the floor, but also distributed ear files and pulled too naughty boys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his retaliation, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the questioning time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In comparison with what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, it is certainly Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it does not relate to his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him at the Bavarian pope are still working eagerly.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, a great deal was reported on the issue of abuse among the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger put in the final report also some involvement or co-worker with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to be entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," "" "said the affected person representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the culprits professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a sought-after pupil put it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it is absurd to assume that it is just absurd to assume that... Bubs have more penetrating or clearer or even more opened than to their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"" "that one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way, the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "that the pupils and / or their surroundings entrusted to him in the run-up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to speak from any co-worker.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of being prevented or brought to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately occurred in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "Violence Excepts" "" "was to be read among the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report" "" "Wegrow" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed and blended into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly the abuses of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is, namely, clean separated: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence and, let us say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the horrible investigative pedagogy, the cases in which boys from sadistic teachers were regularly victimized and portrayed, and who suffered horribly, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on that, as most witnesses stress, the subject" "" "pre school" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims estimate the general humanity of R." "" "and therefore, in many cases, even have positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at most, the reproach remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently hear the ears from the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Spatzengymnasium, which even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out this," "" "that in the pre-school the punishment will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even given the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when testing fines were also banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they acquired themselves in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might overdrive or dramatize and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the sentence was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis maintained that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the" "" "pitfalls of anachronism" "", "which is the risk to evaluate the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this does not apply to sexual abuse which has been abhorred at all times and also not for what was faded in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the practice of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awful and I am happy that it will be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, so to draw earfigs and to the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he was also strictly adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his contemporaries Georg Ratzinger played in talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of testing also contribute to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective that the Domspatzen played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not by any means forbid that he had a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditionally discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world music from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candies alone, you can't stand out of unruly boys once a great singer and before every success, whatever the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: due to the work in the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep believing and heart-good people, of whom you can't imagine that he could only do something for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with him, like many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his graduation, visit him regularly, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until today, that he was once stern to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them the world of music to them.</seg>
