28 @-@ year old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse , found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ ici@@ a from San Francisco , distributed the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was clas@@ sed as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
a spokesman of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; shocked and destroyed by his death . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a stated that Frank initially lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
to connect his family with his family was to always cook something , prepare for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond who lit up every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the S@@ F@@ PD hin@@ ge number under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made Hollywood star clear in an interview now un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always put in drawers or glued onto the outside label , which with me and the reality mostly have little to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not wish to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress loves to spend their time at home , in front of a TV with a loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children in order to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star .
in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not Child &apos;s Play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues looked for a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyrami@@ ds &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses reminded themselves of their holiday , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feed @-@ comfort .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and that ended the riding career again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he had his family run over the system of the AL@@ RV , and he did not even fly to photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and there@@ with also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport aid presented the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid .
the symp@@ athetic sports@@ man doesn &apos;t lack awards .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is a long one .
in Aachen he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring for decades .
and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros equal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the founder Cor@@ nel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ rider Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company wander@@ ed into the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza prize went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ ump Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US Pres@@ i@@ dency candidates are not one thing in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , more philosophical difference .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warn against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate his death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely return regul@@ ations , and he is making a strong impact on a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has opportunities to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged and needs money .
that is why taxes would increase for the rich , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the need to invest , tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost silent .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apar@@ ty wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so there could be party discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more obvious .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection treaty wants to quit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend the renew@@ ables energies with her investment program and demands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both the USA do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be paid better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ushing , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics point to him that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son into the arm .
he gaz@@ es curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
talking to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs created the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - even not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are pursued politically because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them as hope for Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ ours , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who thinks that the end , as soon as they are in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and at worst mis@@ used .
this results in about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what they have experienced , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not know to help , it requires more accommodations just for them , Ur@@ ges B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether or not they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer with no .
there is no such thing in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone @-@ fle@@ dged women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokesperson for the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children in some community shel@@ ters .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations for women exclusively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing or men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can lead to - perpet@@ u@@ ating - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the washing rooms should be separated and accessible to women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the urge to read it on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily make up a second house .
assistance specialists strike out : demands for new combat actions
representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new combat actions in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more competition measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers would have agreed to respond to the concerns about the contract .
in July , assistance physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in favour of elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persi@@ sted quietly &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board has voted in favour of fully rej@@ ecting the proposed new treaty and demanding official re @-@ negotiations with all the concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has today set a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour competition measures starting at the beginning of September .
the disputes caused assistance doctors to strike six times this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Assistance physicians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed narrow and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to the crisis , but would even improve .
the next day , a newspaper compla@@ ined that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if nothing bad happened .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was arous@@ ed .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the backs of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the c@@ ous@@ ins will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a heavy , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family benefits from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan to listen to .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after spending the last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his office .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated if the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted power tak@@ eover as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this ent@@ ails the sustained res@@ ent@@ ment of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian Head of State secured a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course , which even has a deep @-@ rooted fear of regime change .
the summit in this g@@ lit@@ tering palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; to me : two countries that are viol@@ ating from the West and who feel badly treated and now unite .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said that they hadn &apos;t even taken the issue .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hostili@@ ties - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
according to the board of directors of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for clients in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised headquarters and stock exchange listing are changed to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I am now saying that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , as how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think one will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th profit
Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local circuit with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional , because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ ers when he wins the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ckey &apos;s have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career successes
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusi@@ astically fans for years for this kind of sport .
I said Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already picked 6.000 profits if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered almost 30 years in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of grand tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a ban on drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5 years of age .
Russian President che@@ ered Sergei Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expectedly dismissed Sergei Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of Putin &apos;s closest trust in many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Repres@@ entative for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is said that without stating grounds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discharge of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been a deputy since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tall@@ inn in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow International Relations Institute ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it means ( in Russian ) that he later was the Chief of the Staff and Chief of Staff of the Government staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that it is the main task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow more mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , at once wanted to lead Russian environmental policy - met great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say - compla@@ ining for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V participated in the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was the President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people he trusted most .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term President Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , a third term Putin would have viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another close friend Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced his dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his notice publicly .
on the set , there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , will be published according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my whole heart blood into it for the past twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but it will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the planned broadcasting of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff demanded help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sandals &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that have been sp@@ iced out by a fountain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four clos@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 be@@ vel ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
all in all , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is at their place and the final section of the deck is now in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete shot for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of trend@@ setting high@@ - and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the extension of the north tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the north side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by about 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men still have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men still have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown off ang@@ es@@ ey by their fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck an alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we watched the boat around and set the worst off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the shore rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this triggered the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
today , someone gu@@ arding over these men .

she then al@@ er@@ ted her sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .

who builds Braunschweig cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should become much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1,@@ 300 inexpensive apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; housing concept for housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but quar@@ rel is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , you must pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the big issue in the town hall is , however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do we deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent , but as little as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still have to be financed , should provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , according to Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left still wants to impose tough@@ er requirements for investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter what , so viol@@ ators , there is a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the concept of action is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you reconci@@ le the loss of some 1,@@ 300 inexpensive apartments whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
there will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
in order to prevent this , the budget@@ ary spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now buy @-@ out bind@@ ings from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing flats back into the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the western city , Fri@@ sten is running at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing construction companies .
because the number of social housing in the Western city is drastically increased , it is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go into the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this concentrated on more building plots for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children are no longer willing to play outside , but rather prefer spending their free time on screens , has been compla@@ ined by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially on TV , then on video games and recently limited to Smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July .
the market launch in other countries was moved by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ em@@ on who are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation who played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average person puts back every day .
car@@ dio , an Apple Watch app that followed 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who exercise every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees raw data for performance enhancement .
many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to bring about 30 minutes to come &quot; from the sofa , &quot; and &quot; being active every day , &quot; stum@@ bled upon deaf ears , because many public messages are boring for health and come from people that look miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports are reducing their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonder@@ full of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on hunting .
as always , there are also m@@ ill@@ ometric play@@ backs that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if Smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could trace our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will continue with time .
however , due to Pok@@ é@@ on &apos;s success there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , fit@@ ter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in women &apos;s urine
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on the whole line brilliant .
and finally , finally , Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the title of the competition and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a .
the American Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ mo@@ il in the Swedish Bar during the Women &apos;s Tournam@@ ent in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American who wins a competition title and a total of the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 world championships , including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue said that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected her final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment .
the American Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single majority of women &apos;s competition for the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark at the farewell party of retired man co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by coach A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans during a school trip into the gym@@ nasi@@ um , trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost any competition for competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes .
although Mu@@ staf@@ a led through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ei@@ ving .
Swedish lum@@ ber and soil - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ ks .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the suspended beam - and sat on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her gently as she expected her grand@@ son - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she threw out C@@ ush &apos;s hands to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ous case at the stop of music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ an@@ ie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ rator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fired weapon while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police said that the triple murder seems not to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokesman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it was connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in His@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , announced at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which ended on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and from which it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it will be better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , playing toys and of course his mother .
but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his ageing has Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage that .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I didn &apos;t let myself into that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course you have settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never know it and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with help .
Ed@@ mund could not sit or craw@@ l up until his third year of age and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund compla@@ ins for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please tell me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as well as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected virus infected with the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to proclaim the emergency on Friday . it is expected to have more rain@@ falls all Saturday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , informed that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across wide areas in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches could drop in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while it still ra@@ ined in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river A@@ mite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ tmann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flood into Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still plu@@ cked people out of flood water in the districts of A@@ mite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed from Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , is rising overnight .
he said that another step@@ son , who lives nearby , had warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water was streaming and pouring in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members could have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer would have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the flood had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread rapidly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and that the authorities had to consider ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ tmann , an observer near Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the soil was fully balanced by the ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities indicated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and L@@ ess@@ on in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly set up in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , both flooded now .
the chairman of the community of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed from floods .
in the cities of A@@ mite and Ham@@ mond , emergency accommodation was established to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the high water and sand bags were provided for the residents to take the water out of their houses and stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy des Har@@ rison coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses were reported to be in@@ und@@ ated on Thursday , but not reported on Friday until now .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in A@@ mite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several violations , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital when he was transported to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was blown up by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores said to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy communicated to the transmitter that it is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether or not one of the injured men could be the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
cartridge sleeves for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , were paraly@@ zed by the crime scene .
it seems that this was clearly a constant struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were shells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there seems to be several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ sen@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles met in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing reports of the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a squ@@ ir@@ rel on the arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I put forward under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and that for more than one reason .
first of all I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this crew , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Co@@ cian , the Catho@@ lic@@ in is round , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally ech@@ o@@ ing the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ mas@@ tics routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American , who won gold at an individual competition event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the peak of this kind of sport , but this is not the case for gy@@ ms throughout the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sport and gym@@ n@@ ast is primarily in private gymnas@@ tics that can be maintained by parents who pay for training , setting , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) .
the majority of these Turn@@ stones lie in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes since they started the gymnas@@ tics .
we have to inspire the communities of inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls , who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible gymnas@@ tics training .
I founded my gymnas@@ tics foundation of 20 years ago .
at my events we have offered free and affordable gym@@ na@@ sts in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls interested in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls .
it &apos;s such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &apos; Girl Power &apos; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , you motivated so many young girls with varying backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance physicians would like to organise further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance physicians who voted for a vote refused him .
in July , Hun@@ t had revealed plans to introduce the agreement forci@@ bly and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assistant doctors shall receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend bites in order to improve care for un@@ scheduled times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ intern for assistance physicians reported last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance physicians have still considered serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and it will be given to treat all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in just eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time is running out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes caused by talks have caused the government to participate and sometimes silence the de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the result of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had done until the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the vibration and address the concerns of the assistant doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further training measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the pi@@ cket chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better weekend pay for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition measures do not reach a minimum , but they have already stra@@ ined out@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare the patients , car@@ ers and their families only wor@@ rying , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we have spoken to the intern &apos;s Committee and with the Ministry of Health as well as other mini@@ stries positively responding to concerns regarding tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training courses , additional training for those who return from a vocational training period , training costs , mutual recognition of the curriculum , further education and the health ministry regarding the compliance of the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for individuals with heart disease .
this medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty materials in the ar@@ tery walls that form layers .
when the plaque breaks apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that c@@ ass blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffering from a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness revi@@ ves electoral fraud in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ let Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report for corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities ignor@@ antly being ignored like a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town councils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption scandal , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious pictures would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish shut @-@ off tapes outside elections to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommends that voters should have an identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment a vot@@ er has to name only his name and address .
the report proposes not to apply any removable ink on a person &apos;s finger if they leave their vote in order to prevent someone to vote twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for electoral fraud but also to protect the local government from the broader corporate culture that comes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s electoral scandal in the East of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ ne Rah@@ man was to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person would choose another .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud across the country .
he expressed in particular alar@@ ming about the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which the older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including joining badges to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proves that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such a behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists work letter voting documents to stop &quot; elections . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May calls for harder registration checks to prevent the electoral list@@ ings being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters prior to choosing your document .
don &apos;t use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has handed out her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter of let@@ ter@@ box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban on political activists to edit complete let@@ ter@@ heads and envel@@ opes of letter elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set off lock@@ outs around elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change in the law , which facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees are usually able to go through the election cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ ne Rah@@ man and his deputy to be un@@ fit for corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty on a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ checks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town councils . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spreading of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ gers and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are advised this week by Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proved to be an impressive double @-@ go@@ ver of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ on@@ ik@@ in is by no means the only athle@@ tic athlete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Rio Olympics in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ gers on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain arch@@ ery of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son caused a rush to Twitter after images on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ ily similarly .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got ins@@ an@@ ity in the social media and admitted that he has heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t see any simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I feel it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a with her big , expressive eyes is supposed to go through Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an &apos;s Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for many years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a motion higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another lasting comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal swi@@ mmer Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to equ@@ alize an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alists in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide sm@@ iles similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mmer has died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis on the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m outdoor swimming staff@@ el ou@@ tra@@ ged viewers of the C@@ BC live transfer of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ischen Games on Wednesday
the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; as M@@ ief went off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m outdoor swimming staff@@ el .
Mac@@ Donald , who was brought aboard the commentary team of the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be said : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese girl has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , as she called M@@ ief , he died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the swim staff@@ el 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor jer@@ k , making it possible for Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
spectators throughout Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by the sound and language
E@@ mm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator have just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not broken that they were still on air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m outdoor swimming staff@@ el for women as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which many made him speak
Twitter users didn &apos;t stop when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # was disgu@@ sted .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comment , said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment on a swimming pool was broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with the people who answered the B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter
the commentary colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on Mac@@ Donald &apos;s behalf
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ ies in the social media yesterday night .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
shop@@ per in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the business
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled out their clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked at her as she looked in it , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tasted the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recovered and the business left without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , with@@ drew her own trun@@ ks and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she simply stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she with@@ drew the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , because she laid her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she liked nothing , moved and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone looking at someone - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that somebody would take home under@@ pants that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to draw the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman touched her and pulled out and did not wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapon attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you get closer to you , then you should turn around first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your front arm and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then beat him with the knee into the l@@ ath and twist , while the attack@@ er bl@@ ots before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they judge the weapon on him .
in attack@@ ers who approach the front , technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly what Mak@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y the saf@@ est thing is to over@@ reach your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller with@@ drew his immune system and lit@@ ters of a serious test by dra@@ gging some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k crashed his train on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a dish@@ washing button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before finishing each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get into .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brought some surprising results to the light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea to lick off the fl@@ ushing button of a pull toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be totally re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings at stations to flush kno@@ bs of toilets , the task has defini@@ tively put his immune system under a test
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he did justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test sample showed a lumin@@ omet@@ ry of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick off after their lumin@@ omet@@ ry number was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands were of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is near to the worst thing I have ger@@ o@@ cked in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I won &apos;t stop here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I had to lick him , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey carried out in 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria , especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent , said that they at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destroyed before del@@ o@@ ving social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ cation with a loss of £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls were g@@ aping holes , wooden boards were torn , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she fears that the apartment is no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also known .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , disputes and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash has been found .
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were torn open .
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and had to be inv@@ oked by the police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing deleg@@ ated her and her partner forci@@ bly to the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation was acclaimed by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have arranged the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the church , garbage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant det@@ ain@@ ees to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ o@@ cul@@ ation is always the final step into consideration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have made the information come to us .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .

workers of the house administration will now have to clean up rub@@ b@@ ish mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after having found himself guilty of the possession of a class B drug in commercial view .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in a car accident in 2013 .
having been homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti me@@ ared with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will navigate rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row , by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , said that del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ aches as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work together with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ma Long in a league table for table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old won his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
the World Ranking First awarded the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and the Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made up the title with each other .
thus it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of the Olympia Stadium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sets and in time outs , they had no coaches with them .
they pulled back on the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their prot@@ ectors on top of each other in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches to this place I &apos;ve played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ma had really to fight with his 28 year old opponent only in the first set .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang since only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma , not the expected stirring match developed .
nevertheless , there were enough breath @-@ taking ball changes to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the bronze game against the 40 @-@ year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ri@@ j , the white rus@@ se had a ri@@ pple injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with plate .

Donald Tr@@ ump grants ″ big problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states , to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now admitted weaknesses of his campaign in the U@@ tah republi@@ can strongh@@ old .
a rare moment in which the multi @-@ lane and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed such a thing as concerns about how correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own Republi@@ can camp out of the race , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilty were false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media cre@@ ws .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey carried out by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his competitor were equal to the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that can be used for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be endangered .
in an interview by the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I &apos;ve done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be successful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it fails for him for reasons of political correc@@ tness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tr@@ ump is said to have threatened to withdraw funds to support his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values .
instead of this , the candidates of the Republi@@ cans for Congress are stronger than the arms .
Olympia : tri@@ ster dec@@ eption in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary commission on the case .
Ken@@ yan athletes are threatened with the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud test at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee immediately agreed to establish a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told me that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , launched a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ äu@@ fers F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors .
the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , and announced an IA@@ AF spokesperson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the following actions of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will perform an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an IA@@ AF declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station and released himself as F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich , submitted and signed the rehear@@ sal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics delegation headed by Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed him about pending dop@@ ing tests against money payments from his country .
according to media reports , he was arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing contracts for some time now .
during the announcement of more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was unusual to note that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics began .
as a consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports the ARD has repeatedly raised alle@@ gations that dop@@ ing aids are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a substantial mentality of sports bet@@ ting .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in the Russian athle@@ tics field .
in doing so , it could be proven that this type of sport was opa@@ que and systematic .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical won in Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled herself with the role of Maria a youth night@@ mare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that it is Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she re@@ members her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly , because it is musi@@ cally unusual !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh pretty pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same topics , and today they are as meaningful as they were back then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London ma@@ ids who joined the IS were killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British girls who left London last year to join the IS , was reported to have died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death several weeks ago in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the land @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from the east of London went to a plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says that in case of a victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Justice Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands approval since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will ap@@ point the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that Clinton expects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were Lak@@ ai@@ ans and Hel@@ per Hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants to Calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and Men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere in order to publish a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine distingu@@ ishes itself from Old@@ school play@@ boys as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he thinks it does the calendar as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to the presentation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for publication of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or in person at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass ev@@ asion
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons at short notice with tens of thousands of protective @-@ seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the tough advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan following the attempted coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already covered Kurdish strongh@@ olds with criminal actions several months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the secret put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes stock of refugees in their own country produces refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Association compla@@ ined about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Ala@@ wit@@ tic cities .
Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the association demanded that the Federal Government be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is held against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the brand name of the brand as a Gü@@ len follow@@ er destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alist and secular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reported on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already set up the largest group of asylum entitled asylum seekers in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore nearly 29 per cent of all of whom were entitled to be granted asylum ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there are no conflicts of war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum seekers according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. , from the national side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the land tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
until 2021 , the country &apos;s elections will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because it &apos;s not so stupid as to date : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ for @-@ election campaign - that bites itself .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on holiday .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers travelling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the land tag .
there are practical problems : hel@@ pers who hang up plac@@ ards , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count votes at the end , only work tedi@@ ously .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign just close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and there is also something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting is how strongly new@@ bie Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , one can see from his big posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
otherwise , Se@@ ering has got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel is bl@@ aming the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top @-@ edge candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes an election campaign at the wrong time .
she has twice invited German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to make big news : Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ kreis is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and West Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , general secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual campaign conditions on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , according to Kok@@ ert , only plays a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that in the country you cut the base that it needs to be very hard to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly there in the expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert to his fellow campaig@@ ners , however , is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village elders , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is much stake in the game , Sell@@ ering has now called on his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign .
in poll@@ s , S &amp; Ds last at least 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just close to the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election in 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the vac@@ ations @-@ need and move their electoral campaign largely into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green campaig@@ ners go to search for local vocal agents among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ates straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment : restaurants suffer from block @-@ down
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabili@@ t@@ ated .
for those responsible for the construction works that start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only around 8 pm , praise is everywhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything pretty jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay either .
the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at the beginning of the week , and everything will be ready by the end of October .
it will also be praised for the construction of the construction work , for example when it comes to furnishing accommodation .
since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ verb@@ ingen was lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg was restored , the traffic situation within the place has eased .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ verband from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partial complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy chief conductor Florian King , responsible for the transport @-@ related management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because there were many cre@@ eping routes and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sig@@ nage .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ king in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality reinforced the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed about the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been spent .
the fastest was travelling with 77 kilometers per hour in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
but since the construction site has moved on , it has become cal@@ mer .
for the business people at the B 27 , it is only a little consol@@ ation that Rot@@ tenburg customers are now open to the road again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to sales break@@ through@@ s in them leaves everyone who is asked to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also acknow@@ le@@ dges that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lear@@ ner is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the locals along the street are the most exploited .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly a crown , finds clear words .
that is already exist@@ ential threatening .
not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; hit hard . &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we must be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue rose to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street refur@@ bish@@ ment has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have to be dismissed .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the note answered , the restaurant otherwise benef@@ itted from the advantages of location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages that arise through the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other county circles , where such a kind of gener@@ osity was handled .
at all complaints G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently due to complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t ride , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family @-@ list returns to the end of the renovation work .
in spite of the crises with BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction on its customers for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
it is constantly scre@@ wed on laws in the name of the fight against terrorism .
after the recent attacks , Minister of Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a dick@@ head security package .
but what has a toler@@ able status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the vers@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim no one .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was in the midst of results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère passed a little time before he presented his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , filed : that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU specifications on air passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second start for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to pose sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and kno@@ cking jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he believes this to be reasonable and also demands nothing that has no chance in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a safety check .
in the case of toler@@ ations for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than before - for instance , to commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are politically and legally delicate .
some of them still seem ou@@ tra@@ geous and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , in the face of the high refugee numbers , many people were worried about security .
and things that people pro@@ found@@ ly employed were not to be missed out in election times .
the inner security has moved immen@@ sely into the focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly placing themselves in position on the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days , it was high between the two parties .
first of all , a gar@@ ris@@ ky quar@@ rel on the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the department chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also struggles here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t think of a return from the double @-@ pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
it is not sensible to do it anew .
and in the case of a bur@@ ka ban , he has un@@ constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether its own package is constitu@@ tive to all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it is still necessary to show itself .
there is a lot of things that could cause quar@@ rels .
but the SPD is currently trying to benefit from internal security .
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still able to get off lightly .
despite diesel scar@@ ves , deliveries are increasing worldwide .
but it is not running in all markets .
with the recall action , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces about a term .
Volkswagen starts off deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand VW was weak@@ ening especially in Western Europe and thus again loaded the overall sales , as announced by the company in Da@@ x .
in July , the VW brand sold 1,@@ 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the home market Germany , deliveries dropped by almost one sixth .
head of sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July especially to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a reluct@@ ance to buy in some core markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU also bur@@ dened , explaining a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the main affected household brand of Nieder@@ sachsen is already getting off lightly through the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only an output minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales increase from January to July .
Volkswagen supplied 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ating exhaust gas testing software .
in Germany alone VW pul@@ ls around 2.5 million cars to re@@ fit the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars had no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car manufacturer put a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate to the customer after the retro@@ fitting , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as stated on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason to be j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport confirms that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion do not take place and all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not what was meant in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , come to a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
in customer interest , too , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the tape scandal leads to in@@ security with regard to possible warranty regulations , as it was called .
for this reason , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see in the future demands punishment from rich savers - a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on checking or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not fear to pay pen@@ alties for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on checking or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will be 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time now , he has taken 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot pay 4000 Euros for every million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost will continue to exist .
leaving cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank counters would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the Bank &apos;s Chief Financial Officer .
most clients would have an understanding and change to other types of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative federation of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account transfers , credit cards or transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits from 3 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , CEO of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide compensation for deposits , and the competition in Germany is too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is well @-@ equipped with wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she le@@ aned money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the G@@ mund , established in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; no further banks are currently known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which calculate a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesman Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is tough , and the migration of investors to competition is threatening .
customers in Germany won &apos;t be able to please that in the same width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely middle @-@ aged men love plates .
before you r@@ ushed to the comment section to post it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Al@@ le@@ ein@@ sam@@ en@@ Men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als , who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight at the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group .
it is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older res@@ ellers retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v match ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , holding a modest grey suit and stu@@ ff@@ ing wild@@ ly before I stay , hold my hands and say something more intimate like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly lost to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record speci@@ als .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , of Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men of middle age , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3000 or 4000 records .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the sn@@ apshot by email , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and bought items that he sold when he was young and bank@@ rupt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I probably was a bit too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend their own time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets will apply to You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he noticed , however , a new wave of people influenced by the media pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy back their old records .
from the conversations that I have led , people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of the record revi@@ vals of a given age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers contacted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar record sleeves , from items that evo@@ ke happ@@ ier youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is so much for me as a collector so I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally concern yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fl@@ utes from a pile of records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while stro@@ lling through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hi@@ es aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone came here recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ centered , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor , has an entertaining audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle aged women .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz gro@@ wers from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks stran@@ gely lonely , but obvious psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to detect if you stand beside someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for several minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
she is more likely to have a window @-@ window than a big shopping .
it does not deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ ded si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression to brave jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing themselves for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id C@@ ameras , before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , they are un@@ considered , at least in stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female colle@@ cti@@ bles that exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bum@@ ble through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ving look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who raises nothing of middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders .

French court re@@ jects offer of demoli@@ tion of businesses in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional shops in which people within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , selling hair@@ dressing services or selling tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , out of which no taxes would be paid and which lodge a fire and security risk .
humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the government @-@ supported union and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary stores , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated non@@ profit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees living in the jungle camp has increased to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains fighting
despite his disap@@ pointing appearance in the Olympic era , cyclists won &apos;t want to get back to Tony Martin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly say it &apos;s hard to comment the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse in silence what reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time timer world champion , who lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Microsoft did not share how much money flows for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give up missions to players and confront enemies as well as provide equipment .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meas@@ ur@@ ers : in different federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new ligh@@ tening devices are being tested , which are supposed to be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident focuses , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabili@@ t@@ ating bridges with temporary speed police , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary flash to meet the speed limit .
however , a permanent mobile construction may be too dangerous or complicated .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology allows all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as driving b@@ ans after time , driving stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art movement , the trailer can be moved with each car with trailer hit@@ ch according to manufacturer .
so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear into a protective outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the lightning from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information provided by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and has now also been used .
foreign authorities also spark@@ ed with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 copies last year .
Britain re@@ covers silver in 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji master@@ class receives gold
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated at the de@@ odor@@ o stage in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side qu@@ il@@ ting , back , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was won by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day , could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Bri@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , she lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began mira@@ cul@@ ously and caused the attacks of G@@ Bs to crash .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was ro@@ aming in the corner .
with four minutes playing time Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
a h@@ ass@@ le tor@@ ches of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua had a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ attachment and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion took a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still learn to learn .
that &apos;s how it is .
GB led fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through to a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the southern se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans whose fans sang , flags wa@@ ved and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked out cr@@ un@@ ched into the grass .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain urged South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer for ru@@ dder victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inal gold than with these games and that &apos;s what you want .
from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 tough H@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
although there were only two voices in the boat , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was all present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympi@@ ad in two without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British Sports , who laid on such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all , her 3@@ 9th ou@@ tra@@ geous commitment , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant sports@@ women , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of triumph to go@@ ose .
behind every gold in the herd is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make up the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and there was no other assistant than the coach who did not know about 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is operated and that &apos;s what they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been quite a terrible situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing to itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , their first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a busy morning talking something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , who was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive dan@@ ke goes to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to train or have a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race during the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t prepared to make something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding next week , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , &quot; she said .
exemplary for clarity 31 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water purpose con@@ voy as a model for large water producers .
this was the reason for some time ago in the original one in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio .
a little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia commen@@ ded the purpose of the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the v@@ ei@@ te stone group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the ken@@ nel association , stands for 28 years as Managing Director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ group headquartered in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply agreements for other towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ eller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the T@@ DF in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from plum@@ bing and maintenance work on office and organization activities , budget@@ ing , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , she named the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high @-@ tank ( 1999 ) , the purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the new water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and I have always added new innovations , because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ er &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has used a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water purpose band@@ age and he lived down@@ right the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for that he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ eller , on his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ man and he was a faithful bu@@ ck .

as highlights from his point of view , he described Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe burst at the high tank at Kirch@@ berg on a third of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
you can also only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brunn because one filled the high tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .

the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is openly concerned with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other concerned parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease was recognized by her son , she believed that she must die .
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago had come forward well and now learn privately in New York , where it is the best therapist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something which dates back two years , when I sang at the Milan Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10 : 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called us and said to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator is on the run , after him will be publicly prosec@@ uted .
meanwhile , in the meantime , Sven S. could travel by car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it is however a few years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
if you see Sven S. , the 110 is to be called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
in the first place , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide any information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ness or the relationship between perpet@@ rator and victim ; however , she confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing kn@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special deployment detachment ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green energy promotion are from the table .
it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Survey among the existing plants for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with the Commission for Trade Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent falls .
but even this would not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
as a result , the status quo of the current regulation is largely as@@ cer@@ tained .
the successful effort made by Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of emissions legislation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation worsen@@ ed when the world &apos;s largest producer in China threw masses of steel onto the world market in the face of the ailing domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import ste@@ aling effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have risen .
it is unclear how sustainable the price over@@ haul is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
finally , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as Steel Economic Association announced on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced quantity went back the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been up by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association expects an increase in order in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in Leh@@ ra@@ mt &apos;s study she finished the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing is moving - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good about her health and spirit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Senior league . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to talk and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
for this , sen@@ iors exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
who regularly challenges his lungs , doesn &apos;t get out of the pu@@ ddle even in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Senioren @-@ Organisationen .
in the older generations joint singing had a much higher priority ; it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by song lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia are sin@@ king themselves in long @-@ lying events .
when singing , a particular performance is required to the head , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone are practicing so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the feeling of self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and vig@@ il@@ ant beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are plenty of good reasons to start singing .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a tone goes wrong ?
in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , your family , friends or neighbours may ask for help with the internet search .
if you like to sing , you should definitely join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does good and has something liber@@ ating - that is valid for all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers on scre@@ ams of juven@@ iles
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover which effect the ru@@ gs of kit@@ tens on adult animals have .
to her surprise , the mi@@ cks did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the grad of K@@ atz@@ enbach in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te von K@@ ätz@@ chen , who are in great need , as scientists have found out at the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of kit@@ tens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited kit@@ tens for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ ten @-@ cries were different with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female cats from the M@@ H@@ H livestock hus@@ band@@ ry were observed .
they were played for a rep@@ p of little ones that were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited kit@@ tens , which were elevated in addition .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who haven &apos;t had their own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned around faster to the driver when this calls were played by the very excited kit@@ tens .
this ability may be alleged or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , no matter if they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the attempted coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ eling of the Arch@@ riv@@ als between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
already during the arrest of the exceptional state after the overthrow of the revolution in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
even before football is not stopped .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ ie Hak@@ an Sü@@ pot@@ r .
according to this , the South Coast living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ku@@ r should be a suppor@@ ter of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ es for 90 days still until October , it actually has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , Erdo@@ gan declared the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the club &apos;s club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially arriving at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory bull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disap@@ pointing season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g , only sixth was enough .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did that and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year ran better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
at the time of the coup attempt at the AC Florence and only borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the attempted coup attempt , the current political situation in the country did not come back after his European holiday .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club boss F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man quoted .
to this end , however , the storm would have to be willing to wai@@ ve around a third of its annual volume estimated to 7.5 million euros , &quot; Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already twice locked for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova can &apos;t start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the theme dop@@ ing still determines the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ eph@@ im@@ ova , who acc@@ ented herself after a dop@@ ing ban her start law shortly before the games , was scre@@ ened out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 m breast ) .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with an up@@ setting smile she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was clear that it won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst into a che@@ ering storm .
but there are many other sports@@ men who are going to start the Olympic Games in Rio despite the dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he had been locked for two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 metres in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down for six months after taking the pain@@ killer Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after surgery , she had a strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European Championship from 2010 to 2016 was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant mean meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic denied the scientific use and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold favorite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and 21 months closed .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , fu@@ elled mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete had so many med@@ als later recognized .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with him testosterone dop@@ ing .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to hand over Olympic silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European Championships due to testosterone abuse .
he also received the recognised bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Sports Court of Sports CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world champion and gold favorite was tested positively until May , but can still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , clu@@ es were found to take a forbidden dietary supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA dropped mil@@ dly and already ran on July 13th .
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Sch@@ nö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cutting wounds and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already left it again .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , is still unclear .
in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as unnecessary .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a life district of two bombs .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday morning , two explo@@ sions went up again , and another person was killed , according to the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach resort of Pat@@ ong , which was popular among holi@@ day@@ makers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive set has gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , there were several det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south east coast several wounded .
from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ eth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express oneself with possible motives - but probably it is a question of the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revolt movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
the authorities would have kept secret notices on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days , but they were not informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks .
the police advised their officials throughout the country to enhance security around major government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bomb attacks , but mostly they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the present bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its website to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its environ@@ s .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary travel to these provinces is dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) is applicable to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elabor@@ ated by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta CEO and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to insti@@ gate chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody uph@@ eav@@ al , re@@ affir@@ ms itself to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting the grip of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in sight of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several state offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the federal government have also provided the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence of aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D vice @-@ president Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ dine of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in an extrem@@ ist manner .
that is why we now observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multination@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ dine said that his authority was closely coordinated with the authorities during the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court .
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with pop music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertisement for your own cause .
propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there were reports of contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said he had no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case - the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes its direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view of the clear increase of legally listed crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and asylum seekers , Ma@@ dine said he would not talk about new rights in this regard .
but in recent years we have found that there can be judicial structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler Group .
it may well be that other legally @-@ terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee trage@@ dies or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a clear or pan @-@ European control of legal terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried about the fact that many resor@@ ted to the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects in case of attacks on asylum accommodation were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who , however , radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mood @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te Bec@@ omes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ sized float from Ethiopia slowly swa@@ m so slowly that it was temporarily no longer visible in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his course with a back@@ rest of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old take part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special status law from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries known .
as most athletes run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something else .
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the rounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ hale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
referring to a &quot; well @-@ being , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; made fun of him with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot;
his time , he took only a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ meter Fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete alone in a run over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle .
m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was f@@ ren@@ etic at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim in front of Olympia only eight months before the competition and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending electoral defeat so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is speaking at an election campaign in Florida .
should there be nothing with the choice of US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately , it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC .
if it does not reach for him in the end for reasons of political correc@@ tness , that is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
he called the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the IS terrorist militia ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more opposition was formed .
post increases in trade with electro @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric car of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter as well .
the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter shortly .
next year , the post office wants to offer its electric vehicles on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been examining whether they are to be delivered to their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter with which letters and packages are to be sold to other farms .
post @-@ management Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely inquiries , for example by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bonn Group will shortly enter the mass production of vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in post @-@ factory manufacturing , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and set a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very very robust step towards 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active in Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP management res@@ ig@@ ns after disap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K for@@ esh@@ ad@@ owed that the chair by CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again disap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the worldwide number five of the industry is facing a new beginning .
GF@@ RP board boss wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already reti@@ res from the supervisory body with effect from September 12 .
on 1 September , the management of the Executive Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , informed the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is to officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokesperson &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to mention a company spokesman on Friday .
it is still unclear who will lead the market research company in future .
in investor circles it was on Friday , in the shareholders the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring initiated years ago had been great .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the G@@ RP summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recently bad G@@ RP business figures , every investor will become rest@@ less at some point .
&quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; he said .
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the Company did not stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in terms of the first half of the year , sales contracted with 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros by 3.4 percent .
earnings in the second quarter mainly imp@@ acted the company &apos;s lower value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the Group &apos;s impair@@ ments of 139 million euros , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience business area , led the Group to a loss of 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K still managed to generate a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into tren@@ ches in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n : eight wounded
in the event of an accident involving 43 elderly passengers on Thursday , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , reported the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to avoid the loss of a truck that was partly on the opposite track .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a tren@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman for the police Aur@@ ich / Wit@@ t@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the scene of the accident at Landes@@ straße 2 .
the last passengers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to EUR 3,@@ 44 instead of EUR 2.@@ 10 for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ det ahl from 1 October 2016 ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ ez 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the sewage treatment fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a trans@@ mitt@@ al calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the household by the county office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that these wastewater facilities run under cover .
due to legal foundations , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the facilities cost @-@ effectively .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ ez , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ u will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fees are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Manager Herbert Schmidt presented to the committee , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the preceding calculation period should be equ@@ alled .
Schmidt explained that there are relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wer@@ age , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious impact .
moreover , the waste water volume in all three facilities is slightly declining .
last but not least , due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses , all three systems still have a considerable impact on all three systems .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ ez for almost 20 years .
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced by a damage in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf .
in the pumping station of Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first clari@@ fication pond had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge disposed of and an additional aer@@ ation facility had to be installed in order to meet the water legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued supervision and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 are still clearly below the current level .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of the small waste water attack in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance are &quot; full . &quot;
Schmidt , added to the market community of large @-@ scale entertainment costs in the past 20 years , has been spar@@ ed .
in the opinion of stone houses , the situation for the mentioned facilities will remain prec@@ arious in the long term , especially as the supply area of the Wa@@ ste Management Association Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al could not be extended because it is a deficit institution .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % were posted .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool Sn@@ ap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ unted , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mistakes are made to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past when they were accused that the app would promote black@@ face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when it suggested a filter to some users that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and dark che@@ eks , some critics called it rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow haw@@ k . &quot;
they asked themselves if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indign@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison deci@@ de@@ dly .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widely used over the photos that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and said to the least unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reluct@@ ant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ y , but that the yellow face has been drawn into the ab@@ ject extre@@ mes .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was the case earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for media and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that rac@@ ist controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the partially white , only male leadership and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say what about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a spokesman , the company recently set up a personnel responsible focusing on sub@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , for their part , said that she will have her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership for@@ fei@@ ting IS@@ IS intelligence information , sets out Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than permitted the actual conditions on the ground , an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Committee of Defense Commit@@ tees , Intelligence Commit@@ tees and Military Intelligence , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders typically featured a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; says Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ com range from the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 up to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force to life after it was added that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights into the investigation .
in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports is underway by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the highest ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Committee of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , such as Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; har@@ med the moral of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ com analy@@ st as regards a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor who received Cent@@ com Analy@@ st complaints .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press spokesperson , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes of more than ten years ago , as Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this knowledge , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States wins fourth match in the Women &apos;s Ho@@ ckey World Cup , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before
one day after shooting three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , she knows that : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are at the same time in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place each .
the first placed will take a little longer from the strong Dutch women who lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the American women have triggered a surprising host , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things into a better one .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the work ens@@ um in London that we now have .
we have been able to pull out the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India was without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved in the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US door@@ keeper Jack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the Rio de Janeiro events feel constant and inevitable , a rapid relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod that is handed down from the cross@@ bow to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t switch on the television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a wom@@ ens s@@ warm with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built up by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline .
the Olympic flame does not light every event .
further from the centre , some in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it reign for a long time .
but if I want to make a modest argument for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ sely noticed the last 16 years that many of them , I had questioned , did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had had an athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadian women for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain exterior char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a subli@@ me enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ful tre@@ mor of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , meaning as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before landing at the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to official Olympic programme , they are rated according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but also another high goal in television transmission : the world or the Olympic stadium .
the aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a viewer into tears .
but it is also what I myself consider trying to watch these games as something ti@@ ring .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then downward , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly upwards .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
the women &apos;s qualifying and final hours will take place on Friday afternoon , at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time , the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final hours as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympic @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the an@@ thro@@ po@@ ids and obj@@ ectivity of male athletes - as the male US gym@@ n@@ ast proposes recently according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that the police killed dozens of prot@@ esters during the clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiopia going to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people r@@ ushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less .
witnesses indicated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
the videos circul@@ ating about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to take a hand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now requires a detailed investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will even become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terror threats beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereas dissi@@ dents have been effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or imprisoned , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you op@@ press people and don &apos;t have any other options except protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ hi , a lecturer in Ethiopia .
the entire youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time tensions are rising along the Er@@ it@@ rea border ; a fight for this fragile , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been enforced more or less in recent years , can exploit the turbul@@ ence and re@@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess now explo@@ de under the surface after years of bit@@ tern@@ ess .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate through social media since cheaper smartphones were becoming more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians believed that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia predominantly Christian high @-@ countries , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while exploited by the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but that too is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the area of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos feel that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and who are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , had been Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
he was viewed as a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say he was particularly upset to perceive early signs of dis@@ content and use special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands were prot@@ esting against elections , which , according to analysts &apos; statements , were apparently pla@@ gu@@ ed by the government and then stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest was passing relatively quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and for their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal de@@ mis@@ e of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters attacked in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ res@@ ian town , managed by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flug over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently communicated that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin walk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains Obama &apos;s claim to have established IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to dissip@@ ate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated statement , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings his fellow workers who try to protect him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could not have meant .
after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day on which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help mi@@ tig@@ ate the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate didn &apos;t want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism colli@@ des with Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump attempted to return to this subject again .
talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he thought the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later he declared &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call it back as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more corro@@ sive sound , as his survey values have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a big lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humour .
but while rein@@ forces the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s j@@ okes have brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , made great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about the correc@@ tness of Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ ur &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back@@ bit@@ ers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ cans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by subj@@ ecting it aggres@@ sively in the Middle East .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks against the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV professionals trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ ur &apos;s excuse as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once sold above the price of the market , Café comes back to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a cozy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front were disp@@ elled .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s business , replacing the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people rau@@ ded it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is changing it is also new invention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it uses even the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ nish@@ es like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no beer any more , there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed out by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
another Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point she would take the way .
after the ver@@ b closed , she gave up coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inv@@ ari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I came fourth after seven , every day , like a Swiss watch and they are preparing my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he conf@@ uses his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for decor@@ ating with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go back on offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new verb goes out to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a delic@@ acy , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for sophisticated delic@@ at@@ essen of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
its menu on this day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bricks were told in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop , a small , fri@@ e@@ zy snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the re@@ porter brow@@ ned hack@@ le , this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were made from an ingredient and a bit cheap , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; records the roads with which the country went around to no longer be the land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for Americans became a central theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was also ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ building food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Bri@@ ck noted that coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients in a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
strange mix@@ tures were tried out because a low @-@ calorie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction was given priority over taste or even healthy kitchen @-@ sense .
while resear@@ ching the book , which includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from that period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
like never before , or ever since , budget econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies .
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ mich @-@ pie @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like a million@@ aire man from the world to which he has become .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully strange .
President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to give an example to his stomach .
as described in the book , the arrival of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country came back to its legs .
the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , Bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to food .
in the letter of the book , the couple had better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind bag incident .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosev@@ elt ate at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , adding that it was a nasty trick to miss a humble name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each di@@ pped a little reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ ines , brown g@@ litter .
amaz@@ ingly , it didn &apos;t smell bad .
Co@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he used his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the life of others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died on a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a group of civilians , which according to Bild @-@ Zeitung saved some 60@@ ,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own life on the game in order to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant , showing him in an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant out of the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero he never saw himself , said al@@ oud : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing attacks in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters threw four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb so that not children can play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the painting c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie usually only come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland has only 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 metres far .
only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at a saddle of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle influenced by slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a patent formula for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed long ago that Greenland had become stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie is hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees cel@@ sius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers have little knowledge about Greenland &apos;s lifestyle .
their slow motion was measured against them , when they carried out six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they possibly hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches from higher water @-@ layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 50@@ 2 cm measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
therefore , its birth should be in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons seek larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res of length , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon tests , which is expected to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in their lens nucle@@ us , all larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ irs , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts , created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old at 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
that Greenland shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age .
since one of the animals at 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such Meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live above all in icy waters is no coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , in whose bacon on the neck stuck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon point , was captured in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses warmth .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than in a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very big animal , on the other hand , should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building site in double @-@ pack
in the recent meeting , the Municipal Council has focuss@@ ed on issues relating to building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee accepted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported housing areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the plots were clari@@ fied and the requests for survey were clari@@ fied and the requests for survey were made , the sale of the plots in the residential areas of &quot; Straß@@ wal@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - expansion section 1 ) is no longer available to interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau attract young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , building will@@ s can now announce themselves in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting .
in order to also make inquiries about the settlement of further industrial enterprises , coupled with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan that was newly created in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the area designated there is extended by two par@@ c@@ els to the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main has therefore the best opportunities to attract new workplaces and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary homes will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been approved in the UK .
this is how large US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk management ES@@ R@@ B .
although the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered in Paris , this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg , though , conce@@ als a large fund sector , but does not cut it off as well as Dublin in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
in addition , the city has an easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the Unternehmens@@ beratung Mer@@ cer , the city stands in place seven , Luxemburg on No@@ .@@ 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my econom@@ ist .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry were working in London according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead acqu@@ ires legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US National Ju@@ dge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs incurred by the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two mer@@ ck patents associated with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead after a U.S. judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical acts .
at the request of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. Ambassador Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the reduction of costs incurred during the case of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate Gilead to the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck su@@ ed each other and took possession of one another and took possession of laboratory work to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir was underlying , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the United States say that they have resum@@ ed full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have re@@ conquered full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left in the city , a spokesman of the group said on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) comb@@ ats after the departure of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city .
they have liberated over 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out cleaning work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million for the Democrats and her husband of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in speech fees ; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ presi@@ dency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations over the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; announced Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false statements and re@@ treats in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as the reason for his refusal a tax audit by tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter regarding the democr@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presidential candidate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ visor , said CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspections are not completed .
Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already stated that his refusal to raise questions regarding wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asks him to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she addressed the subject also during a speech on the economics of Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that during the 1990s Tr@@ ump did not pay very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday , indicating that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who pay more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka asked Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial glomer@@ ate here has its seat , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return back to 2007 .
the Clinton , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 2015 Clin@@ tons &apos; tax return showed that it was only USD 100 of its income as a reward , unlike most of the Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ work bodies promote dance ani@@ as elephant protection
wildlife Prot@@ ectors in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to settlements inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea already years ago , has intensified its promotion together with the US conservation protection , trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step approach to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals .
before , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the world phone &apos;s day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , while they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the blow into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned into the ignition cord .
when it is lighted , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a knob and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders into the air .
a touch quite usually already out to chase the elephant .
a last possibility is a laun@@ cher that shoots a gold metal fire@@ work into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

the town council , however , unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the construction of a sales ski on the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ pf@@ alz region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed locations on the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director breaks down Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invitation - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media record after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion because it demanded Arabic guests &quot; according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the B@@ rist@@ ol Kemp@@ ink@@ si offers an opportunity to choose Israel through its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ okes him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel Management &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it triggered even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response on the Internet where people called it a scandal .
some of them subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been given the alleged promp@@ tings of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located in the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all alle@@ gations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to put Israel into the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung has quoted a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
added that the country code has now been added .
police put tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police set up tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the introduction of the police of rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ ald Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters saw gra@@ ff@@ iti on walls against provisional President Michel Tem@@ er .
the latest protests took place a few days after prot@@ esters went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who was removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian enterprises in the country grew strongly , and the ambassador agreed .
Russian companies are adop@@ ting existing connections with Iran , while new firms are ready to access the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan anticip@@ ates a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian representatives abroad gave some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses sought : beverage market covered in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening was carried out on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a gun , three dark @-@ cla@@ d people who had m@@ um@@ med their faces from the staff of the beverage market demanded the release of cash and then fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver VW Golf .
the police did not share how much money was captured .
the cul@@ pr@@ its should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and can be viewed poorly .
the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned in direction Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel car park located opposite the car park entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( against 19.@@ 45 ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should report urgently to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun at summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection federation Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers during their summer time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet holiday home Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first week of school holidays .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ ahr@@ a by visiting the stro@@ king zoo .
on the other way to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
at the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group enjoyed themselves in the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing .
children and car@@ ers with their own meals such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled .
the workshop was dedicated to creating beautiful jewels of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill @-@ game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te Abend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun was laughing and the children and young people returned home satisfied .

the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were overcome .
in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all mini@@ stran@@ ts in the next two years , the senior qualification round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgri@@ ma@@ ges were examined and finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where during the year of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , with the opened doors of mercy on the Freiburg Münster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 Min@@ is from Bit@@ tel@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Heili@@ gen@@ zimmern , were on their way .
in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims at a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms &apos; Cross and distributed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms &apos; blessing .
from Hor@@ b , he was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where there was also a Mu@@ en@@ ster of Our Lady standing and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage departed from Münster .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is at field @-@ crosses , chap@@ els or churches always made a stop to sing a song from specially arranged pilgri@@ m song .
for the nights , the parish priests of the local par@@ ishes were at their disposal .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and star@@ tling dinner and breakfast at the stages .
it continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous stretch of the way , had to be lowered at first around 500 metres altitude and then climbed again .
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , the final stage went to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Münster later in the afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was given thanks .
the evening mass in the Mu@@ en@@ ster was welcomed by the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the gau@@ ze metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home as Br@@ ite Gold wins for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took part in the anch@@ or@@ age that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had done to E@@ igen . the j@@ ump@@ y made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of the six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after finding a modest sixth place in London despite Ho@@ ys &apos;s return in March .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as an exec@@ ution@@ er .
Gary &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y winning - and Sk@@ inner set up an Olympic ch@@ ord in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders were winning in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was barely back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , moving in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and , above all , Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ ds when they climbed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a flat@@ tering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for me .
we set up an Olympic ch@@ ord in the final round and the World Champion defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection from England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in cycling .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he wins Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( an apparently holy date for British sports ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - an output of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same for Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometers .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will be focusing on safety .
yesterday he had argued with representatives before the qualification when function@@ aries called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional depic@@ tion of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there were drama in the background , such as Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s res@@ ignation in April , in the midst of sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and me@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but if you look at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , who reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the melt of Port@@ land due to the lifting of energy demand
the future of the aluminium mel@@ tdown from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract , thereby raising all delivery contracts as the supplying energy company has shared .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect , since the melting plant consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ tori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large al@@ um@@ ina melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , said that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is in majority ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through melting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to mention that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a period of 12 months so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenue of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong terminal markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L shared with the fact that the value of the contracts had already been written down in his annual decline in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; expectation of a termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties was the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have taken effect from November this year , even though there is still an explanation of why it res@@ igned from the contract .
as a result of the poor economic conditions in the industry , analysts warn of the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land use some 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and a total of 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity per year .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner clan Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran to the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , a cri@@ p@@ pled reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classic turn : they all planned a surprise party .
this is the c@@ lich@@ é plot of almost every birthday party of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim likes her to have beaten the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference resem@@ bling a picture book as a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome .
the disclosure of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leak before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there have been clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , model@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or youths from today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success does not like everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mi@@ dd@@ le@@ pieces of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were high again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but to pass on to the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ ming of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community centres annually assign 160@@ ,000 people every year
more than 16@@ 0.000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary functions are rejected annually by the community centers , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the community , which are already over@@ crowded , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , it is expected that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of the community centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centers found that thousands of people were rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only get worse without the government &apos;s resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are under@@ financed chron@@ ically , which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just dismissed - all these people have problems in a legal way , and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
the federal government will cut its resources by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to delay these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need for legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Campa@@ ign indic@@ ted after collabor@@ ators allegedly drew weapons
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump@@ ur Campa@@ ign was accused of alleged in@@ action after it was told that in February its campaign manager for North Carolina directed a gun to a staff while on the way in February in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the County Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave up for months to wait for the matter to be regulated internally before he realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kne@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i concluded that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he gave up in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired for harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indi@@ ct@@ ment only comes two days after Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a ri@@ ot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - gun@@ men and weapon friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and judge should ap@@ point judges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign was clear that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not go to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for violation of duty of care and of Philip due to bodily harm and lasting psychological damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press spokesperson was not to be achieved for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
responding to calls at his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the SPD and CD@@ U are notable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this gave representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
but in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD declined from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was only close to the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previous 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
despite the slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated again in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
in each case , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the parliament .
according to the survey , the SPD in Berlin voted only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they still lie behind the Gre@@ ens by 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but 15 percent before the left ( 11.@@ 7 percent before the left ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
at 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pirates would not miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
email and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the success@@ ors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was pretty mon@@ strous .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would extend to about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Office in West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ Format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be a lot for those standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , even if agon@@ izing .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the cell phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was very proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything has changed .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &apos; mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled by Microsoft .
today providers dominate the market today , who all came much later than Nokia .
always online , which is today for a lot of people everyday .
in 2015 , nearly two billion smartphones worldwide were available worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices have been sold , and Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around € 400 billion .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telec@@ oms companies .
in the meantime , an entire industry has been developed around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough in the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone at the Mac World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , easy to use by touch screen .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , and today the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry dominated the market .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the smartphone off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies close to He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will already provide 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ n@@ ating on the world stage .
the two leaders were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 bn , and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and throughout the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , who has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion on private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display ton@@ nage on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook shared that his des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change coding with regard to his advertisements to make it difficult to detect indicating the extent of advertising on which part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced it had found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams &quot; spokesman wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ back fight between the time @-@ consuming open source community and the conver@@ ters has been underway since the invention of ad block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people worldwide , according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people worldwide , almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion users active on Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenues of Facebook .
the company has said it to ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokesman .
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficient share of revenues so Facebook can make the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook shared that it would update his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have more control over it commerci@@ alized advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be worried about new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokesman in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a silent means , which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to get more control in the hands of people .
woman suspected of commit@@ ting suicide to Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police are calling for witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed on a highway at a presum@@ able suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was over@@ powered by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on site .
several drivers have already heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said these and every witness of the incident promp@@ ts him to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Court st@@ etter announced to Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the car@@ eless killing after crossing a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious in the street , the court arrested .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman - who had responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once again hab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have er@@ ron@@ eous conditions similar to its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow transformation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protected from evapor@@ ating .
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow transformation of the Venus exposed its day @-@ side of the sun almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet scientists .
although it was once believed to be hab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins A@@ val@@ an@@ che as trainer
Patrick Roy res@@ igned as a trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che on Thursday and led to a small co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ura confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy commented in a statement .
during the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the team &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who was hired by Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy was honored as the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season in the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
he brought the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the late season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy joined four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ workers resume talks , strike out strikes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour struggles on wages for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all the parties sit down for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally conducted on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will keep a few full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , beginning next year to re@@ address the problems .
the unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its counter@@ parties in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % reduction for on@@ shore sub@@ contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alizes its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes held in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star @-@ pile rot@@ ates at different rates as well as in what connection the rot@@ ational periods are with the planet creation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ouses , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these stra@@ pping stars po@@ ke large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble star spot -- such as sun spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars rotating slower than smaller ones .
&quot; at the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the cluster of stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
we want to learn more about how , when and why stars are slow@@ ing their rot@@ ational rates , and so to speak , hang their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rates of rotation of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will play the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on 12 August against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature , under a ten @-@ year contract , has awarded him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez re@@ paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made some mile@@ stones .
with the Hall of F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted to the Hall Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - on the field was so controversial his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was blocked for 2@@ 11 games due to a settlement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the prime suspect to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for years .
after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time swe@@ eter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends still get the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the actor Cameron Di@@ az and told him relations with pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympath@@ ies from the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ riv@@ al Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; sang the trailer at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a learned athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obstacle runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions these news are coming to the fore .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was detected last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterfly , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the events over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing has been requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and requires a full cooperation in the investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ in@@ hua cited from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court in CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio the news about the positive trial at Dan@@ ek@@ owa was le@@ aking , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it should act in the forbidden substance to act with the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v reported immediately with criticism of the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ charged nation must not take part in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ aboli@@ c ster@@ oid n@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny the intake , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , especially the Dan@@ ek@@ owa case is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF prohibited the entire Russian squ@@ ad except for systematic dop@@ ing . Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio as well .
in swimming sport , the previous rounds in China were also cat@@ ered for in heavy disputes between the athletes .
the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio .
sun was also at the heart of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positively tested in the Chinese championships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only for a three @-@ month barrier .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mailing malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey conducted by malware Defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , sometimes several times a number of victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were once the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som funds required by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetrators are increasingly speci@@ alizing in attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to rede@@ em@@ ing ran@@ som is considerably higher than in private users .
&quot; we are currently observing a frigh@@ tening fast evolution of malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most painting programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the cul@@ pr@@ its discovered black@@ mailing software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was done quickly over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
to get the end key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users find their personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops .
the damage is correspon@@ d@@ ingly higher if a ran@@ som@@ ware is hit .
22 percent of German companies reported losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break up business operations , in one case , people were in danger of life .
numerous hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay , get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a type of customer service to take more money .
they explain to their victims via chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or de@@ code free sample files for free .
and if private individuals are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must negotiate partly hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four people .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by buying malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail then searches for more hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is done per infected machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals then instruc@@ t sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that provide better security for their data .
over 50 per cent of the IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on preventing ran@@ som@@ ware by using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement , the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the damage potential much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in future , the perpetrators could also completely new targets on the internet of things in the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the release of such a blocked heating could indeed be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe , and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the rear compartment , it does not work in any place .
the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top is a little bit off .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a boot space of 4@@ 53 l with raised back rests and 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ bench can be folded up like chairs and thus offer storage space that is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment is well loaded , but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ litre diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rpm ranges .
however , he should do his job somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is grati@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems belong to the city emergency brake assistant ( works up to 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote light assistant is very reliable .
and the intelligent tem@@ por@@ eg@@ ler responds to traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ ters the speed if necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI socket are located under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .

airline is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht ( Ober@@ landes@@ gericht ) of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability is conceivable only in case of dangers which are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee injury during the fall .
but the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation to the man .
case of illness : when pays the organis@@ er
after your trip , you will only get money if the cause of the illness is without doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the case of the case , a family had to suffer from diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought the tourists back to a defective sewage treatment plant that pur@@ ported to contam@@ inate the sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip was poor - and compla@@ ined to the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
in fact , the treatment plant was in fact defective .
but the organizer only learned about it shortly before leaving the pla@@ inti@@ ff .
until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the verdict .
no im@@ pur@@ ities were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with one another - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and decided at the same time to respond to terrorist threats .
sure is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and split .
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
if convic@@ ts would have to leave the country more quickly , this will increase safety and also increase the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the German Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium @-@ four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be under punishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire will be so am@@ ended that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much deb@@ ated duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to seek solutions to reduce the risk of citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act a ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared to deal with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans to investigate the use of concealed investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against shareholders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality earlier .
in constitutional law , a general prohibition of full @-@ time conce@@ al@@ ment is problematic .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green Chief Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist act and act of action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet S@@ prü@@ che and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better flow of traffic on the motorway t@@ inge
it st@@ ews on the stra@@ pping street regularly - here is a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legal ab@@ norm@@ ality should be prolonged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all car drivers who are driving in traffic on the ambient street every night in traffic jams when they drive over the highway Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
road construction on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the exit Wes@@ el Straße is extended by 700 meters .
drivers can then go directly from Hammer Straße to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is split@@ ted early , thus improving the overall flow on the busy section of the Federal Highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the fe@@ eder nerves the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the way back to the bridge over the Alber@@ gh@@ ese way and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the pin@@ hole on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ el Straße .
from here , the traffic is only driven one lane by the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back a quarter of a quarter .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to absorb heavy duty traffic in two lanes .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated plant @-@ daily traffic will continue , the state @-@ owned company cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official period of rest until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal ab@@ norm@@ ality , the state @-@ owned company intentionally selected the bu@@ oy@@ ant time during the school holidays , because it was to be expected with disabilities .
the traffic is passed on a track on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
cross @-@ cultural tour : cultural offerings for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Forest School visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project .
the N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people to visit the cultural institutions in Münster with a migration and refugee background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Kinder@@ haus Forest School has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 pupils between 11 and 15 years visited the production in the little house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcoming classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project .
most of the youngsters of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg of speech , and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , teenagers with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the theatre play area and theatrical language dis@@ sem@@ ination are planned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for better weather
the weather has made the star @-@ schn@@ u@@ ppen Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night for Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the spectacle of the sky , said the Chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we will see many shooting stars in the sky .
the Stern@@ schu@@ ppen is Per@@ sei@@ den , which belongs to the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing Night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep before the wake @-@ up ring .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons for them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society of Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
what you can see below , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an in @-@ and @-@ sleep disorder .
especially through sleep many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board member of the German Dental Association with practice in Lower Saxony &apos;s Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
not in@@ frequently , the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common especially in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors are dependent on one another .
those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , for example , can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disturbances become a doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , says We@@ eß .
the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten down , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or headache .
in order to allevi@@ ate the sleep problem , it is important to find out about their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
in Germany , there is hardly any lowered sleep medicine , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
for this reason , when sleeping problems , you should first contact the family doctor , says We@@ eß .
this can be clari@@ fied by investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what will happen ?
in order to examine the sleep laboratory , doctors advise for example in snor@@ ing with breathing cut@@ ters , in case of disease fatigue , sleep conver@@ ters or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after disgu@@ sting , you go to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a anten@@ na@@ e on the finger .
in addition , a camera cap@@ tures the sleeping end on the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of parking screws where you can sit for better sleep .
We@@ eks counts : regular sleeping and up@@ lifting , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and not look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler comments on Facebook for the disap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at the Olympic Games .
in December 2014 he made gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a for the first time , and at the same time he set up his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself from his criticism of his former team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king of 15@@ 0.000 € , nobody should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night .
the subsi@@ dy system in swimming is bad , however , dop@@ ing controls are very good .
we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely with D@@ oping or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have had to report already nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor .
airport : gang of baggage charges arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
on Thursday , the police of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage pil@@ es as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the area of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport recognized a band that was known to the police from past rob@@ bers .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July and were in a joint , working @-@ like manner and especially professionally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialists of the Cri@@ min@@ crime Council 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thi@@ eves , which had been specially prepared to commit crimes to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , they had exploited over 15,000 euro .
old buildings , some lime trees , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the rig@@ a@@ er Strasse in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in doesn &apos;t look like this at first sight , but the police force them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walking along the road from east to west , you come to play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demoli@@ shed , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will , however , be favor@@ ed with burning cars in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was busy , meanwhile the residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator , Henkel had spoken several times for a tough action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolled official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , the building workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the evi@@ ction had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers pulled down under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who brings up three children here , are particularly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who made a majority of police protection against the v@@ and@@ alistic left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police act between house occup@@ ants and their neighbours , does not seem to exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in , east of Berlin , was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which today also has a low average income compared to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty .
house occup@@ ations and residential projects are also part of the neighborhood . in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Mainz Street close to the Riga .
while the main@@ zer had been swept under large police orders in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has grown to become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world over the last few years .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them at hoo@@ ked discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades thrown with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes are made up of property damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
in terms of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was deliberately drawn to the Riga road - and remained .
that is why it was so important for her to get back her streets : from the police , the politics and the media , who all suddenly claimed the German sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former building spaces that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well @-@ felt are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do if someone never stops ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of those who are anno@@ yed about color bombs : the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
those who draw should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area , who can complain badly about noise .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working groups , refugees , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ ch@@ le is now there , the ice @-@ cutting wool mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has above all a problem .
so some - less mo@@ cking than on the multitude of requested tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write out the place .
we were looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , an ice @-@ breaking wo@@ ollen mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administration work is not its central part , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
above all , it concerns organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent job on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers are available in Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been acknowledged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connection provision .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
responsibility changes from the county office to municipality and job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in fact , the administration does not find any private apartments .
it does not function so far , so it is possible to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , community dwell@@ ings need to be vali@@ dated as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will soon be installed in Was@@ en@@ straße .
but it &apos;s not done with apartments .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent stay , there are intern@@ s , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to fold or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ ch@@ le and customer .
people need to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need special offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here too , administration and hon@@ our@@ able official jump here .
it is important that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it is just a time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
those who develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone else in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problem cases , says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ ch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radi@@ cal@@ isation after recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would complete them completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials have to look for activities on site and in the region .
in doing so , they always have in the background that a new surge of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics ab@@ h@@ ors .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived there where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customers also clearly demonstrate that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable manner .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : search for burg@@ lars with helicopter
