<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues looked for a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden pyramids" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses reminded themselves of their holiday, they hunted at the fast gallop home to the feed-comfort.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And that ended the riding career again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the system of the ALRV, and he did not even fly to photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therewith also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid presented the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sympathetic sportsman doesn't lack awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorrel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US Presidency candidates are not one thing in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warn against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate his death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively return regulations, and he is making a strong impact on a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has opportunities to open up disadvantaged and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes would increase for the rich, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to invest, trump and Clinton are almost silent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be party discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more obvious.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection treaty wants to quit." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend the renewables energies with her investment program and demands:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the USA do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "they should be paid better," "" "says Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rushing, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point to him that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>

<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs created the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhilfe.</seg>

<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and at worst misused.</seg>

<seg id="40">Even in Swabia alone-fledged women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesperson for the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children in some community shelters.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to approve new combat actions in their disputes regarding a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed narrow and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level prior to the crisis, but would even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper complained that Erdogan would have behaved as if nothing bad happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was aroused.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the backs of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the cousins will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a heavy, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family benefits from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan to listen to.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after spending the last month with a failed coup d "état of almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it regards its reaction to the attempted power takeover as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "this entails the sustained resentment of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian Head of State secured a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course, which even has a deep-rooted fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders" to me: two countries that are violating from the West and who feel badly treated and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they hadn't even taken the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov's Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "IVANOV has been part of Putin's closest trust in many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is said that without stating grounds" "" "the discharge of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been a deputy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in the Estonian capital city of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow International Relations Institute (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it means (in Russian) that he later was the Chief of the Staff and Chief of Staff of the Government staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that it is the main task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow more mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ridicule for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was touted as a potential president, at once wanted to lead Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say - complaining for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV participated in the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was the President of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term President Ivanov could become President of Russia, a third term Putin would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close friend Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 bevel ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is at their place and the final section of the deck is now in Rosyth a concrete shot for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of trendsetting high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the extension of the north tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the north side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances on which the team worked, were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "no matter what, so violators, there is a sharpening of the situation on the housing market." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>

<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you reconcile the loss of some 1,300 inexpensive apartments whose funding will expire in the coming years?</seg>

<seg id="27">Because in the western city, Fristen is running at the end of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children are no longer willing to play outside, but rather prefer spending their free time on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially on TV, then on video games and recently limited to Smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was moved by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon who are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average person puts back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardio, an Apple Watch app that followed 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees raw data for performance enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to bring about 30 minutes to come "from the sofa," and "being active every day," stumbled upon deaf ears, because many public messages are boring for health and come from people that look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports are reducing their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on hunting.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also millometric playbacks that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone apps like Fitbit could trace our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will continue with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokéon's success there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>

<seg id="17">She expected her final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I put forward under the Women's Olympics in the Turns and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this crew, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Cocian, the Catholicin is round, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally echoing the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual competition event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the peak of this kind of sport, but this is not the case for gyms throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last five" "", "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turns is an expensive sport and gymnast is primarily in private gymnastics that can be maintained by parents who pay for training, setting, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these Turnstones lie in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to inspire the communities of innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation of 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable gymnasts in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It's such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of 'Girl Power' by holding the Olympic team golds and thanks, you motivated so many young girls with varying backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlet Luton Rahman was removed last year on the release of a government report for corruption</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller withdrew his immune system and litters of a serious test by dragging some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk crashed his train on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwashing button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before finishing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get into.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," "" "brought some surprising results to the light." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to lick off the flushing button of a pull toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his bowel by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings at stations to flush knobs of toilets, the task has definitively put his immune system under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he did justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test sample showed a luminometry of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometry number of fresh washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick off after their luminometry number was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands were of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "This is near to the worst thing I have gerocked in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't stop here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended with saying" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had to lick him, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey carried out in 2015, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent, said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a delocation with a loss of £50,000 because it had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an irreparable state.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were gaping holes, wooden boards were torn, trash was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears that the apartment is no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>

<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also known.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, disputes and curses.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>

<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were torn open.</seg>

<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delegated her and her partner forcibly to the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>

<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the church, garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>

<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have made the information come to us.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee immediately agreed to establish a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan functionary told me that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, launched a urine test under the name of the 800-meter Läufers Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by doping inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF world association has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to exert its own investigations, and announced an IAAF spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "depending on the results of the study and the following actions of the IOC, the IAAF will perform an assessment," "" "he said in an IAAF declaration." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and released himself as Ferguson Rotich, submitted and signed the rehearsal," "" "said Kenyan boss de Mission Stephan Arap Soi." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days earlier, the Kenyan Athletics delegation headed by Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed him about pending doping tests against money payments from his country.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya has been under special observation at IOC after numerous doping contracts for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="17">During the announcement of more than 2000 doping target controls submitted by IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusual to note that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">Before the summer games in Brazil, the world anti-doping agency had exerted much pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics began.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a consequence, the WADA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the rules of WADA.</seg>

<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of television reports the ARD has repeatedly raised allegations that doping aids are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a substantial mentality of sports betting.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in the Russian athletics field.</seg>
<seg id="25">In doing so, it could be proven that this type of sport was opaque and systematic.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday makers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the land tag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">Until 2021, the country's elections will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because it's not so stupid as to date: summer holidays, heat and land-for-election campaign - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers travelling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the land tag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: helpers who hang up placards, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count votes at the end, only work tediously.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign just close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And there is also something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newbie AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign, one can see from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seering has got cold feet and chancellor Merkel is blaming the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, their" "" "We create this" "" "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top-edge candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when one makes an election campaign at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited German chancellor Angela Merkel to make big news: Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and West Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority of other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Nordost-CDU largely renounces the usual campaign conditions on market places and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that, according to Kokert, only plays a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union also noted that in the country you cut the base that it needs to be very hard to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly there in the expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "the Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his fellow campaigners, however, is also self-exposing:" "" "they must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village elders, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because there is much stake in the game, Sellering has now called on his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, S & Ds last at least 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just close to the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election in 2011, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the Greens, the small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the country's day." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the vacations-need and move their electoral campaign largely into the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online campaign" "", "it calls the president Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green campaigners go to search for local vocal agents among holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvates straight with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "election holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction works that start at 5.30 a.m. and end only around 8 pm, praise is everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they did everything pretty jagged," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at the beginning of the week, and everything will be ready by the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">It will also be praised for the construction of the construction work, for example when it comes to furnishing accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterverbingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg was restored, the traffic situation within the place has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterverband from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were partial complaints," "" "says the deputy chief conductor Florian King, responsible for the transport-related management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because there were many creeping routes and more familiar with their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were franking in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality reinforced the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "there have been considerable transgressions," "" "says King, who made himself informed about the situation." ""</seg>

<seg id="18">The fastest was travelling with 77 kilometers per hour in the pace-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">But since the construction site has moved on, it has become calmer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27, it is only a little consolation that Rottenburg customers are now open to the road again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales breakthroughs in them leaves everyone who is asked to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "", "thus for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences." ""</seg>

<seg id="26">The locals along the street are the most exploited.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly a crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is already existential threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be glad about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the sales revenue rose to" "" "far more than 50 percent" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the street refurbishment has" "" "thrown back its operation" "" "by two years." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Half of his employees have to be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have acted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the note answered, the restaurant otherwise benefitted from the advantages of location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages that arise through the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other county circles, where such a kind of generosity was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">At all complaints Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regulars now look less frequently due to complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't ride, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his family-list returns to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">In spite of the crises with BSE and a bird flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction on its customers for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, which is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="15">"" "" "" "the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, de Maizière starts a second start for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to pose sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and knocking jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "this will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "the CDU admits." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, he believes this to be reasonable and also demands nothing that has no chance in the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas also present de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: he plans rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detaining people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a safety check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - for instance, to commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are politically and legally delicate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them still seem outrageous and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of patient for example - the question arises: what does it actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, in the face of the high refugee numbers, many people were worried about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people profoundly employed were not to be missed out in election times.</seg>

<seg id="36">In the past few days, it was high between the two parties.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rushed to the comment section to post it under the pseudonym non-AlleeinsamenMen's middle age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older resellers retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov match?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, holding a modest grey suit and stuffing wildly before I stay, hold my hands and say something more intimate like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly lost to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specials.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, of Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3000 or 4000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and bought items that he sold when he was young and bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I probably was a bit too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend their own time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets will apply to YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He noticed, however, a new wave of people influenced by the media pe, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led, people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of the record revivals of a given age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers contacted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar record sleeves, from items that evoke happier youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is so much for me as a collector so I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally concern yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flutes from a pile of records." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while strolling through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophies aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here recently and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-centered, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor, has an entertaining audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sexpacked pop instead of experimental jazz growers from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strangely lonely, but obvious psychic traumas are hard to detect if you stand beside someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for several minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She is more likely to have a window-window than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is... "it drives off with a dearded sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of plate lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression to brave jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping themselves for a moment around Polaroid Cameras, before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are right, they are unconsidered, at least in stores in Soho, the large number of female collectibles that exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bumble through record stores of Berwick Street and the sheets by plates, while they avoid the starving look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who raises nothing of middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional shops in which people within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to energydrinks, selling hairdressing services or selling tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy, out of which no taxes would be paid and which lodge a fire and security risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the Court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the government-supported union and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary stores, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people who live" "" "in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated nonprofit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure" "" "would be a catastrophe for these children, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees living in the jungle camp has increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase of newcomers during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation of speed measurers: in different federal states, among other things in Hesse and Brandenburg, new lightening devices are being tested, which are supposed to be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident focuses, where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed police, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary flash to meet the speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction may be too dangerous or complicated.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measurement technology allows all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as driving bans after time, driving stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of fijis when they were defeated at the deodoro stage in Rio with a result of 43-7.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in handling, side quilting, back, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was won by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Briite tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began miraculously and caused the attacks of GBs to crash.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau was roaming in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hassle torches of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua had a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the reattachment and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion took a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still learn to learn.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through to a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the southern seeinsulans whose fans sang, flags waved and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis hugged and GB kicked out crunched into the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain urged South Africa in a tight half-finals match from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="4">Although there were only two voices in the boat, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was all present when they rowed to the second Olympiad in two without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British Sports, who laid on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all, her 39th outrageous commitment, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant sportswomen, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to goose.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the herd is a battalion of willing helpers who make up the incremental advances that make the difference and there was no other assistant than the coach who did not know about 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operated and that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite a terrible situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go back better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing to itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory, their first thoughts came to Williams, who spent a busy morning talking something more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>

<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veitensteingroup headquartered in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150,000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared by additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from green energy promotion are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Survey among the existing plants for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with the Commission for Trade Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG levelling of 20 percent falls.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this would not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation worsened when the world's largest producer in China threw masses of steel onto the world market in the face of the ailing domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import stealing effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have risen.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price overhaul is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Finally, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as Steel Economic Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief upliftment in May, the produced quantity went back the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been up by two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">The association expects an increase in order in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in Lehramt's study she finished the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "singing is moving - emotionally and physically," "" "she describes." ""</seg>

<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good about her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "because singing is a great hobby for seniors," "" "says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior league." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to talk and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Who regularly challenges his lungs, doesn't get out of the puddle even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisationen.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations joint singing had a much higher priority; it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By song lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia are sinking themselves in long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">When singing, a particular performance is required to the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone are practicing so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The feeling of self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and vigilant beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are plenty of good reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a tone goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbours may ask for help with the internet search.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you like to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good and has something liberating - that is valid for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Friday morning, two explosions went up again, and another person was killed, according to the authorities." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach resort of Patong, which was popular among holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive set has gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the Revier of the Coastal Police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, there were several detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-western coast as well as in Chumphon on the south east coast several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">From a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bombings carry the same handwriting," "" "said Army General Danai Kritethavee Friday morning before journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we expect it to be a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express oneself with possible motives - but probably it is a question of the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist revolt movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities would have kept secret notices on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days, but they were not informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is hiding behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police advised their officials throughout the country to enhance security around major government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are repeatedely smaller bomb attacks, but mostly they are not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the present bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its website to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its environs.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, not necessary travel to these provinces is discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) is applicable to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elaborated by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta CEO and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to instigate chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody upheaval, reaffirms itself to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting the grip of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the country's younger history.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center, the slightly oversized float from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that it was temporarily no longer visible in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte became a viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his course with a backrest of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly athletic figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old take part in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received a special status law from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries known.</seg>
<seg id="12">As most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is everything: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "some media referred to him as" "" "Robel of Whale" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Referring to a "well-being," the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod."</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he took only a minute and almost five seconds over the 100-meter Freestyle, played no role.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Eric Moussambani took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a run over 100 meters of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="21">Moussambani was frenetic at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim in front of Olympia only eight months before the competition and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to EUR 3,44 instead of EUR 2.10 for the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Weldet ahl from 1 October 2016; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopez 3.36 Euro (previously 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf the sewage treatment fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a transmittal calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, at the approval of the household by the county office Kulmbach, it was established that these wastewater facilities run under cover.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the facilities cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopez, Lindenberg and Zulu will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fees are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Manager Herbert Schmidt presented to the committee, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the preceding calculation period should be equalled.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained that there are relatively small facilities with a very low sewerage, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">Moreover, the waste water volume in all three facilities is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last but not least, due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses, all three systems still have a considerable impact on all three systems.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welshahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zulultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopez for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced by a damage in the sewage plant Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station of Welshahl, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled and the first clarification pond had to be removed, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional aeration facility had to be installed in order to meet the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued supervision and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 are still clearly below the current level.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the small waste water attack in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance are "full."</seg>
<seg id="20">Schmidt, added to the market community of large-scale entertainment costs in the past 20 years, has been spared.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the opinion of stone houses, the situation for the mentioned facilities will remain precarious in the long term, especially as the supply area of the Waste Management Association Friesenbachtal could not be extended because it is a deficit institution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as an Asian caricature criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunted, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All mistakes are made to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past when they were accused that the app would promote blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it suggested a filter to some users that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and dark cheeks, some critics called it racist caricature of Asians - "Yellow hawk."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison decidedly.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely used over the photos that the filter was "vulnerable and said to the least unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very reluctant Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowy, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the abject extremes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stolper.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "when one of Snapchats filters a picture that is insulting for a user," "" "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was the case earlier," "" "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that racist controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the partially white, only male leadership and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say what about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently set up a personnel responsible focusing on subrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu, for their part, said that she will have her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than permitted the actual conditions on the ground, an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Committee of Defense Committees, Intelligence Committees and Military Intelligence, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "intelligence provided by high-level CentCom commanders typically featured a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," "" "a newspaper article cited the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," says Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the Centcom range from the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 up to the middle of 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after it was added that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights into the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of the CentCom reports is underway by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," "" "announced the highest ranking Demokrat in the Committee of Representatives, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, such as Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "harmed the moral of analysts and" "" "gave too little room for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at the Centcom analyst as regards a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General Inspector who received Centcom Analyst complaints.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesperson, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes of more than ten years ago, as Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker states that contrary to the government's statements, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This knowledge, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after shooting three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, she knows that: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are at the same time in their group with the Britons in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place each.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take a little longer from the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising host, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she couldn't qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team, began to turn things into a better one.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the work ensum in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to pull out the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a setback from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without victory in the tournament in the game, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved in the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US doorkeeper Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro events feel constant and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod that is handed down from the crossbow to the swimmers to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't switch on the television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a womens swarm with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not light every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, some in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I want to make a modest argument for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was so sparsely noticed the last 16 years that many of them, I had questioned, did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadian women for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain exterior charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a sublime enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonful tremor of his never-ending impact - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, meaning as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before landing at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to official Olympic programme, they are rated according to execution, difficulty level and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also another high goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympic stadium.</seg>
<seg id="28">The aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a viewer into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I myself consider trying to watch these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes upwards, then downward, then effortlessly upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualifying and final hours will take place on Friday afternoon, at 13.00 Eastern Time, the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final hours as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympic-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the anthropoids and objectivity of male athletes - as the male US gymnast proposes recently according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the police killed dozens of protesters during the clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was relentless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses indicated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">The videos circulating about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to take a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now requires a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will even become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereas dissidents have been effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or imprisoned, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you oppress people and don't have any other options except protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshi, a lecturer in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions are rising along the Eritrea border; a fight for this fragile, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been enforced more or less in recent years, can exploit the turbulence and rearm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode under the surface after years of bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate through social media since cheaper smartphones were becoming more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians believed that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia predominantly Christian high-countries, prospered in politics and economy, while exploited by the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we're going to co-ordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the area of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and who are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, had been Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was viewed as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say he was particularly upset to perceive early signs of discontent and use special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands were protesting against elections, which, according to analysts' statements, were apparently plagued by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest was passing relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in fighting poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal demise of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters attacked in Gondar, an amresian town, managed by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflug over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently communicated that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains Obama's claim to have established ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump was trying to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republican candidate candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow workers who try to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the opposite to the previous day on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help mitigate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism collides with Mr. Trump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump attempted to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew strong criticism when he thought the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but later he declared "Of course I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call it back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "depending on how the reaction fails." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more corrosive sound, as his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while reinforces the focus of attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumpur's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbiters, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by subjecting it aggressively in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks against the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he mocked the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "TV professionals trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumpur's excuse as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a cozy café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash which didn't have Wi-Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices of his Bedford Avenue shop front were dispelled.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie's business, replacing the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people rauded it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing it is also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a client offered him to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It uses even the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes like capers and sauced onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer any more, there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also pushed out by prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Another Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg in the past and visited the Verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint she would take the way.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb closed, she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb I liked," "" "she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-haie usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland has only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 metres far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates at a saddle of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle influenced by slowness, however, seems to be a patent formula for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness" "", "comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist assumed long ago that Greenland had become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-haie is hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice-sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have little knowledge about Greenland's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion was measured against them, when they carried out six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They possibly hunt dormant animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadaver, which torches from higher water-layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 cm measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the lens nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, its birth should be in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons seek larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of the third smallest animal with 220 centimetres of length, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapon tests, which is expected to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lens nucleus, all larger Greenland-hairs, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14-amounts, created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetre long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark is likely to be 392 years old at 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals at 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-haie with the increase obviously can be at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such Methusalemes live above all in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck stuck a 120-year-old harpoon point, was captured in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than in a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should rather invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media record after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli apprehension because it demanded Arabic guests "according to a staff."</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed between the countries that could be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted?</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministrants from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were overcome.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all ministrants in the next two years, the senior qualification round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimages were examined and finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where during the year of the Holy Year of Mercy, with the opened doors of mercy on the Freiburg Münster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenzimmern, were on their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, pastor Storost sent pilgrims at a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims' Cross and distributed the Pilgrims' blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, he was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where there was also a Muenster of Our Lady standing and so the Pilgrimage departed from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis at field-crosses, chapels or churches always made a stop to sing a song from specially arranged pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights, the parish priests of the local parishes were at their disposal.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a tasty and startling dinner and breakfast at the stages.</seg>
<seg id="13">It continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The day after St. Peter, which was the most strenuous stretch of the way, had to be lowered at first around 500 metres altitude and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, the final stage went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Münster later in the afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The evening mass in the Muenster was welcomed by the Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the gauze metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took part in the anchorage that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had done to Eigen. the jumpy made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of the six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after finding a modest sixth place in London despite Hoys's return in March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as an executioner.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gary's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy winning - and Skinner set up an Olympic chord in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders were winning in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was barely back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, moving in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hinds when they climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23 year old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic chord in the final round and the World Champion defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on Kenny's and Hoys side, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said:" "" "it feels like London with all the GB flags on the tribune." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in cycling.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he wins Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently holy date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an output of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same for Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will be focusing on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had argued with representatives before the qualification when functionaries called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There were drama in the background, such as Shane Sutton's resignation in April, in the midst of sexismus- and meobbingvores as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, who reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium meltdown from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract, thereby raising all delivery contracts as the supplying energy company has shared.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effect, since the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzer, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, supplying the large alumina melt with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is in majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through melting," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to mention that the contracts were so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "" "which should have entered into force in November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a period of 12 months so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "this is why AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the revenue of AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong terminal markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL shared with the fact that the value of the contracts had already been written down in his annual decline in the amount of $187 million in "expectation of a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to book the Treaties was the" "" "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure power supply to the melt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have taken effect from November this year, even though there is still an explanation of why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a result of the poor economic conditions in the industry, analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland use some 600 megawatts and a total of 900 megawatts of electricity per year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "wrote Kendall." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or just keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), a crippled reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), which ends with a classic turn: they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is the cliché plot of almost every birthday party of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Cardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendalls's big sister Kim likes her to have beaten the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference resembling a picture book as a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising) from the 832 pages of the tome.</seg>
<seg id="11">The disclosure of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leak before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>

<seg id="14">Oscar winner and brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" "" "breakthrough model" "" "of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or youths from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenny's success does not like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the middlepieces of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were high again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to pass on to the displeasure seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once again habitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have erroneous conditions similar to its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow transformation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected from evaporating.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow transformation of the Venus exposed its day-side of the sun almost two months," "" "said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously thought by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was once believed to be habitable, Venus -- in the course of several billion years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star-pile rotates at different rates as well as in what connection the rotational periods are with the planet creation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhouses, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is located 445 light-years from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated some 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these strapping stars poke large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star fails, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a discernible star spot -- such as sun spots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars rotating slower than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the" Ballet "of the Pleiades, we see slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the constellation of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the cluster of stars of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>

<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A learned athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critically acclaimed athletics competitions these news are coming to the fore.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court (CAS) confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterfly, only about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have to take part in the events over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the International Olympic Committee (IOC) the opening of the B-sample and a hearing has been requested.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and requires a full cooperation in the investigation," "" "Xinhua cited from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court in CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also during the night of Rio the news about the positive trial at Danekowa was leaking, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "said the Athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it should act in the forbidden substance to act with the EPO blood doping agent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekowa was suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample should have already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov reported immediately with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-charged nation must not take part in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tomasz three days earlier on the anabolic steroid nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of athletes, especially the Danekowa case is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Association IAAF prohibited the entire Russian squad except for systematic doping. Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio as well.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming sport, the previous rounds in China were also catered for in heavy disputes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harsch.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle, I want to hand over," Lacourt said in the French radio.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also at the heart of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was positively tested in the Chinese championships in 2014 on the stimulant trimetazidin, but had to sit only for a three-month barrier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide erpresses hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmailing malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by malware Defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, sometimes several times a number of victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were once the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom funds required by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to redeeming ransom is considerably higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently observing a frightening fast evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most painting programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the culprits discovered blackmailing software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was done quickly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users find their personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher if a ransomware is hit.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies reported losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely break up business operations, in one case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Numerous hospitals have already been victims of attacks in Germany, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims," "" "Do not pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a type of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims via chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decode free sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must negotiate partly hard and pay five-digit sums to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by buying malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is done per infected machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals then instruct spammers with the spread," "" "declares Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that provide better security for their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 per cent of the IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on preventing ransomware by using file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the damage potential much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could also completely new targets on the internet of things in the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the release of such a blocked heating could indeed be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer to think of sleep before the wake-up ring.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons for them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society of Sleeping and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you can see below, however, is the Insomnia, i.e. an in-and-sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially through sleep many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Dental Association with practice in Lower Saxony's Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, the sleep disturbance is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common especially in depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors are dependent on one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who have a herniated disc, for example, can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturbances become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of a month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten down, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleep problem, it is important to find out about their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, there is hardly any lowered sleep medicine, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, when sleeping problems, you should first contact the family doctor, says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="26">In order to examine the sleep laboratory, doctors advise for example in snoring with breathing cutters, in case of disease fatigue, sleep converters or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please don't make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After disgusting, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera captures the sleeping end on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of parking screws where you can sit for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeks counts: regular sleeping and uplifting, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and not look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive to it.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday, the police of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some lime trees, in between still another cobblestone pavement: the rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't look like this at first sight, but the police force them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking along the road from east to west, you come to playgrounds, a fresher kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will, however, be favored with burning cars in recent weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was busy, meanwhile the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator, Henkel had spoken several times for a tough action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June, the rooms on the ground floor, the cadmiths, with 300 police officers, patrolled official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the building workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers pulled down under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who brings up three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who made a majority of police protection against the vandalistic left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police act between house occupants and their neighbours, does not seem to exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain, east of Berlin, was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which today also has a low average income compared to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">House occupations and residential projects are also part of the neighborhood. in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainz Street close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainzer had been swept under large police orders in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has grown to become a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world over the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them at hooked discs or freshly painted facades thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year along with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason why not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are made up of property damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">In terms of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was deliberately drawn to the Riga road - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for her to get back her streets: from the police, the politics and the media, who all suddenly claimed the German sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless newbuildings in former building spaces that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "finally, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well-felt are living here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if someone never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of those who are annoyed about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area, who can complain badly about noise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working groups, refugees, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuchle is now there, the ice-cutting wool milchsau, which has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocking than on the multitude of requested tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write out the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, an ice-breaking woollen milchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration work is not its central part, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it concerns organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent job on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuchle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been acknowledged." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility changes from the county office to municipality and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find any private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not function so far, so it is possible to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, community dwellings need to be validated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will soon be installed in Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it's not done with apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customers and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent stay, there are interns, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to fold or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "Regine said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuchle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need special offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here too, administration and honourable official jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is important that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it is just a time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who develop the feeling that he can't help anyone else in Urbach can't work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are problem cases, says customer honestly," "" "people with whom nothing works." "" "therefore, the work of Deuchle and customer is always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after recent occurrences, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine's customer quite clearly," "" "what some may call naive" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would complete them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials have to look for activities on site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they always have in the background that a new surge of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we haven't arrived there where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customers also clearly demonstrate that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
