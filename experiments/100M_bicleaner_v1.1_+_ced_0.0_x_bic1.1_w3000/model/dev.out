Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international deal as well as about Teher@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement expansion and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal promoted by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two has continued to deterior@@ ate .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , which was partially regarded as aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken to Obama , a meeting had refused to accept this election in Israel at that time .
in an emergency call professor conf@@ esses to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked with a somewhat shi@@ vering voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ written note that was dressed on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school area , where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said Lamb had made the fatal emergency call at some point after .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police seized him .
one day after the shooting at the university that forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were happy about his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal pre @-@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said that he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for whom Lamb had worked so hard , would not guarantee for him an automatic way to create an assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after leaving the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , teaching geography and education .
he took a doc@@ torate in education in spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years trying to teach her the guitar game .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously spending some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail both appeared in a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Fr . Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the congregation at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wache while the Univers@@ it√§t@@ sch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb did the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to set fewer workers for Christmas time
To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas seasonal workers as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the current staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , some 45@@ ,000 workers have been hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees is rising from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great time for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and an arm &apos;s length of being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
back in Time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unden@@ i@@ ably the biggest travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon states that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN leader again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the last eleven national poll@@ s showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously question what it means to the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which even won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a universal choice .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now realizing tr@@ umps staying power and starting to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a passing phase :
drop Any popularity values have revol@@ ved around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey from the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; unhappy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans fores@@ ees Tr@@ ump Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament to a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality of a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of ten In@@ depend@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they put up their v@@ ows , republi@@ can voters are holding Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who will most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say four out of ten for a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it is clear that a large number of GO@@ P voters look at the campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to d@@ umps guidance while the anti @-@ trou@@ gh support is diff@@ used to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates .
but a survey conducted at the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump has called &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was a pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse of 2016 .
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expressions of Tr@@ ump will keep America from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems that Donald Tr@@ ump will also do it .
the government &apos;s fru@@ stration has climbed to new heights .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new ABC / Post Mon@@ days Survey , they rather want a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent contemp@@ tu@@ ated . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential districts
here in the Hob@@ 2@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive complex - with a view of the North Sea resort .
in the street , a square meter of a home @-@ house @-@ house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations a square meter the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top residential resorts , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; V√∂lk@@ el has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , well marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ Dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂tz@@ e
double keeper in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas M√ºller has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas M√ºller paved the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂tz@@ e gave the FC Bayern a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth season in the series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
M√ºller received gra@@ cious assistance from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto for his 28th hit in the Champions League for Bayern leadership , who had a flan@@ k thought of the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the match in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ held word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the top class , including clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 there was also Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often to work with their offen@@ sives .
the attacks were introduced too often by shifting on left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which rarely went through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
M√ºller had more luck right from the right , when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half one .
first of all , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ St√ºr@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown beat the Pol@@ es &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto saved with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians had their usual dominant play , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set up needle stit@@ ches .
but on the door@@ keeper of Manuel Neu@@ er , he was leaving .
for example , when he drove a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good .
Mario G√∂tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cabin , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after gradu@@ ating , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Executive Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to do something else , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by eleven meters M√ºller added another one .
before the game they had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a sm@@ alli@@ sh group of partly war@@ med Bayern fans in their audience block apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went against the Munich @-@ based tra@@ ilers .
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : without aband@@ on@@ ment the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ degree rate .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained the author Thomas Dietrich of the English University Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people have to convince people to become non @-@ smokers , said head of study H@@ einer Boeing by DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health up to high age according to our findings .
in Germany , over 20 per cent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness imp@@ acted by the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already indicated that smoking can increase the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study confirms the findings .
archae@@ ologists stum@@ ble on rem@@ nants of the late antique in Cologne on the Rhine .
for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard archae@@ ologists have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ nants of historic buildings , said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments since the start of construction work on the Rhine .
at all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a specialist office for archaeological ground preservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists were now found .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , probably belonging to the church .
young woman covered by freight train
after a young woman is unhappy at the railway station in the Gei@@ id@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ den , the Federal Police asks the population for help .
early on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock the woman crossed the railway line towards the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from M√∂n@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , it carried the most serious injuries by recording the train .
she was treated as a doctor on site and brought to a hospital by rescue workers .
on the basis of the ni@@ ghtly cross @-@ crossing of the young women , the intermedi@@ ary officials are not aware of any findings .
the incident could possibly be observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
there are residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by by Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Bri@@ ck@@ bak@@ eries , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ stra√üe and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Stra√üe ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the resolution of the dispute on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ str√∂m in charge of the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposes to launch the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TTIP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings see specifically that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
until now , the parties involved in arbit@@ ration proceedings have agreed to one another ; there was no possibility of objection to their jud@@ gements .
in the discussion of the past few months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , comment@@ ing on Malm@@ str√∂m .
in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment court according to its own statements .
there could , for example , settle disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , which have been demanded above all by large corporations , are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary to permit compensation to tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Camp@@ act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; signed the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great step forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into account essential points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked with other EU trade ministers in spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ str√∂m &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the law@@ suits of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be un@@ sustainable .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy young folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of different places , which he repeatedly records on the map , about his meti@@ culous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they originated and what it looks like , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative person .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ or that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ aving series : each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive outlook .
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
live is enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , a masterpiece has been celebrated in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
overl@@ apping ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American b@@ ill@@ board charts and is missing in any list of the most influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic sub@@ stitutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b .
as far as the smaller clubs were getting off , the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is part of a five member band through Germany .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests are ban@@ ished in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and to folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience , one hears that the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is possible to throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sla@@ b in the bottom &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens damp@@ ens modest , plays only a few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister &apos;s questions
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awaited by Prime Minister &apos;s questions
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ il and make up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to address the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MEP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatres and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment to become a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour Party &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several titles of titles in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are calling for differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the British correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Industry said that political differences also stack up within the Labour &quot; stack &quot; and to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour should make changes to remove all the idea of limiting the overall idea .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Labour and R@@ ent Minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear , &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of ¬£ 26@@ ,000 to ¬£ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is a T@@ ory boss , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box across Parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another Policy , says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he will refrain from &quot; perc@@ ussions &quot; and the stri@@ kers with hooks , and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally speak the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a Ju@@ dy show that is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was broadcast on television first in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ und increases through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharply according to data which indicates a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and quick@@ est estim@@ ation since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to ‚Ç¨ 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together .
Bur@@ berry shares were up 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods .
Rich@@ em@@ one &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reports growth again .
shares of Glen@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken 2.5 billion $ by a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his rating for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports@@ wear company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
but since 7 am the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the be@@ aver building : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster hangs in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the Suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much the day her mo@@ m ear@@ ns E@@ wa in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Vik@@ toria had to sit in the tenth grade in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fill you with a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory education ?
who are it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bi@@ eber himself does not .
this has already taken care of .
he assi@@ du@@ ed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company to adverti@@ se in the promotional break of the super @-@ player , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account .
and with every doll which looks like it and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber also collects .
when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one is amazed at the wind@@ screen .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
others stress Bi@@ eber exactly in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in number 1 .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t interest the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da @-@ poster brings Lebanon to the potato @-@ don@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ √∂n@@ er ?
both - and namely in the Pot@@ ato D@@ √∂n@@ er , developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ √∂n@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of the Lebanese is now to be registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authority .
Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also works well with its customers .
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Con@@ soli@@ dation Campa@@ ign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ ci@@ dents
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA stores from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a Boden@@ stan@@ dig campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ a and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell che@@ ap@@ ly tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investors strategy day .
there is much stake in the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch around five percent of the food market in these two countries after opening its first markets and take away sales of all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ a &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost some 13 million dollars of profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ a lost market shares in eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s sales in the food and food business are 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ a would likely disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly react to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ GA@@ S market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction while printing on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to compare sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores thanks to fast growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and relo@@ cation programmes to El@@ an are expected to grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his conduct .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ os and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise as a criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight by the in@@ famous argument of Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have hit Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp@@ ing le@@ aked out a potential U.S. Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty much about is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was a little dra@@ fted into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player who broke a thu@@ g out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he has been dealt a little too rigor@@ ously .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he &apos;s good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ os in the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday and describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part of the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ os &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick was very quick to climb up to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs into the eyes of the public , and he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency situation , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to get illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants arrested in a No Man &apos;s land and Ser@@ b officials responded with indign@@ ation .
the people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian ri@@ ot police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , talks will have to take place in Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the conquered Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would record another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not put its hopes on a soon action from Brussels or from its neighbors .
the emergency stand rested on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point in the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sts that most upcoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force around midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government allowed to build along the southern border with Serbia to a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which will be expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities tried 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials concluded on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ zed a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 succeeded , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton holds a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is just 5 points behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters under 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries nation@@ ally say they would support Clinton if she was nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly impressed by her .
the views are stronger with those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top @-@ edge candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time for a woman to be president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clinton &apos;s supporters her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and elec@@ tability are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice president raises the potential for the presi@@ dency of the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
from Clinton &apos;s followers more than half said that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead increases from S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure fell by 78 percent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ tr@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries would be unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in the elec@@ tors of their party &apos;s prim@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are maj@@ orities in Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as Secretary of State continue to be placed , most Democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions have not been affected overall .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now unhappy with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said that her opinion has deterior@@ ated .
they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of her party , this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters : only 32 percent see her as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month , and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them to an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote see also Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump are receiving good lead notes .
Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut off the six tested candidates best with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders more than hon@@ esty , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the preliminary election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is located close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the recent C@@ BS News / New York Times
in the meantime , half of the voters &quot; support in the new survey is eliminated , and others are losing dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS pol@@ l conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , by 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former governor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place at 6 % .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest pol@@ l is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the most recent pol@@ l of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for questioning Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea may be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .

five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
almost two years after a student during a Shi@@ kan@@ ous ritual of a student compound in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , mur@@ ders were lod@@ ged against five .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ceremony in September 2013 and ret@@ arded their transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , reported the police .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g fain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , police officer Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g repeatedly suffered injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died of the ch@@ ic@@ ans every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ es &apos;s family , in an explanation .
fr@@ at@@ ernity and its members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a net interest rate comes , and the domestic investment is falling , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy provides little guidance to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and took 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in responding to the economy and the financial investments .
therefore representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have emphasized so sharply that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
however , in the end , market participants could find that all the fuss was possibly exagger@@ ated due to an interest rate rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things more volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yield 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a more recent study on what happens after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is mostly up@@ trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , fairly flat in the last six days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , Head plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the stocks tend to occur later in the increase @-@ cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and that could accelerate a recession .
what is most not@@ e@@ worthy is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the year round , market participants agreed on an interest rate increase of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were focused on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the up@@ lift cycles of 1950 to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly put into the shadows after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest waiting the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is up to now 74 months .
fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticipated net interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than for shares if they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds the returns appear to change direction once the first increase in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase @-@ cycle , the bond yields immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b &apos;s strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to margins contracting more closely between longer and shorter bonds and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher earnings , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
Jones believes that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat@@ ter , credit tigh@@ tening has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be po@@ orer because an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have out@@ performed companies with weak balance after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt becomes a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most , says Gold@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the pure share games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
savers could see profits through higher earnings , even if experts of different opinions are how quickly that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says EP member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s conservative member critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also went to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leader in parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also went to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC general director rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and making music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the involvement of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , I think it &apos;s important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which was under fire during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sports for it under fire to tramp@@ le the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of ¬£ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC fashion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when it &apos;s next time a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee agency for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August at slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the recording started in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe Black Friday &apos;s slow@@ down in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s major shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there is now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started working with their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is sw@@ inging , and we may experience that growth is less@@ ening .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for rec@@ las@@ si@@ fying revenues .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases prior to this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of shop@@ pers focused on their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites fell off .
experts believe Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium took out that ¬£ 5 out of ¬£ 5 has been spent online .
some products , such as TVs and washing machines , are now being carried out over a third of the purchases via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca by crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia places the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mo@@ z@@ ee .
mour@@ ners filled mostly dressed in white , the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead came their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed by the holy place , where only days before a crane ran through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the beds .
the bodies were released for burial , when the Saudi king suspended a san@@ ction over the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central Bank of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane was supporting .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already agreed that the H@@ add@@ an will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands of people who continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree issued by the National Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , falling into an inner courtyard of the Greater O@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group for non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Greater Mek@@ ka as part of the massive building managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said 15@@ 8 people were hospit@@ alized .
government officials arranged that 1 Million Ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded get half of this amount .

the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has climbed sharply
this results in 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops aimed at tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q stores nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , city chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its will lay down its h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European professional tra@@ des@@ men who carry out the work in their home
if you can handle a hammer or brush to painting walls , you seem to be a minority today .
the British are increasingly employing arti@@ sans to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , according to the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V√©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete .
this is why King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people and to close up to 60 selling points from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the shop are met by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must shift this more strongly towards equilibrium . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies just 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
due to the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice master A@@ ich / D@@ ob will be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ev@@ asion on Wednesday at the regional court of K@@ lagen@@ furt .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of this alle@@ gation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary examination revealed that between 2006 and 2011 the defend@@ ants used funds from association accounts to disp@@ oni@@ ze them in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also accused of financial failures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
the defence argued that , at no point in time , an asset had been created for the association to blame the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity .
the sports officials had only compensated for expense and the sports club they had spent from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( around 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the Brot@@ beck @-@ based firm of the financial department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made money , put our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , it must not be made any debt .
furthermore , in the case of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of expense allowance had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
for this reason , packages and not detailed accounts also appeared , the former chairman explained the events .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ us ruled the two defend@@ ants , said the second defend@@ ant .
why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of the financial statements , it is important to have only been the freedom of the debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , when investigations were launched against the one function@@ ary , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
that were appropri@@ ations , the defend@@ ants declared .
this account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally thought that he was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put into the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified herself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim re@@ dem@@ n@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association has never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary told me that he never paid a cent salary , he only reck@@ oned with mile@@ age and di@@ eting .
he added ‚Ç¨ 1,000 per month to the association , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years were not able to present the accused .
these were , after an operational audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , no longer had been kept , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also referred to o@@ dom@@ eter allowance .
all the de@@ port@@ ations were made in cash , and from his place of residence he had to go to the bank to lead to Blei@@ burg , he stated in his statement .
the trial will continue on 23 September with a survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard sp@@ ends another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction that has been running for three years , the computer giant will continue to build further jobs in the company &apos;s split@@ ting up .
the positions of the US @-@ Compu@@ te H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs amoun@@ ting to 2.@@ 7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special strain of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed for the past three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
on the other hand , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share delivered 2.3 percent .
the Corporation of California Pal@@ o Alto , which has become a large @-@ scale printing company , is currently sp@@ ying on : this is how the computer and print business will be pool@@ ed in a new society - apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another disap@@ pointing PC segment as well as a weaker demand of corporate customers according to its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
this resulted in revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with split@@ ting up and massive positions on change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted late to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
but a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly be rejected : 54 per cent opposed it , 35 per cent agreed .
the fact that other countries are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
on the other hand , 24 percent must intervene in the conflict .
in co @-@ operation with the Syrian leader Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of the respon@@ dents reject , 20 percent would be for it .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second day of the press on the 6@@ 6th IA@@ A
at the centre of the fair stand up to 27 September networked , self @-@ driving cars as well as electro@@ mobility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Connec@@ ted mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide audience can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
the organisers of the Auto Union V@@ DA expect approximately 900@@ ,000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have deployed several hundred refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke &apos;s tear gas and water cann@@ ons .
Euron@@ ews Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line and behind the police officers stood ready .
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials were initially un@@ interrup@@ ting the pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little bit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and obviously injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried .
other refugees were sack@@ ed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
also the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday to make an important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and will keep interest rates at current level from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has capit@@ alized to NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank could possibly leave the null zone and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior associate at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global relations .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point to the fact that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death guard at the Delta State University &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left debt write &quot; &quot; &quot;
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleague , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said he had shot on someone and someone killed .
lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb went 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that she was married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University as his life @-@ lau address on the University &apos;s website .
stars that have lost their lucky charm

in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .

all this surely demands its toll .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
the Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the worldwide approximately 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
there are , however , new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the objective of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some EUR 500 million a year from cost and redemption syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no board for the passenger business in the future .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the management team headed by chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organisation of the 120 000 employees has been a complex undertaking .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of ‚Ç¨ 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective conflict with the pilot association Cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations after the judi@@ ci@@ ary strike on this Thursday should be resum@@ ed .
that was what the union announced .
the topic of the talks should be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be able to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transition supply of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ us concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is over@@ shad@@ owed by the Group &apos;s own cheap line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United won &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat in Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outer defense to tears and exclu@@ des him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it will take six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno was happy to be able to escape a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ mil@@ lim@@ eter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how corrupt I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat of the PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the England def@@ enders have an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s very difficult , because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ √©s Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ ding by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron has known the Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who appeared in 1971 , was decided by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to be a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the next paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book instead gives a summary of the 2012 movie version which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel who died in 1991 but completely unknown .
as if it were not yet suspici@@ ously enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , tree @-@ prone , Th@@ need knit@@ ting once @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a high @-@ hum@@ ming nature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in succession to a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a forward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry any sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid himself , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
based on this : Adam Ly@@ th leaves the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I have said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he will hopefully knock out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t deliver such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick finished comp@@ ton nine .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first deployed Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he is a drummer , whom I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this naturally depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ punch and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed guy has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player .
mos@@ een hasn &apos;t done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred rings at once and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari arrives in the cabin as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see its statistics on - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made some clever additions to the coaching staff .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ lah he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the dressing room , even if the messages are in accordance with what has been said before .
Coll@@ i &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used by the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Great Britain out of the EU ) could gain allow@@ ances if the economy is in a dol@@ drums by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets deeper every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who viol@@ ently fought for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are so deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always full of guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contract changes that they usually do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wants a UK @-@ looking UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s Fran√ßois Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will pull a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not deliber@@ ate helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during the UK referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankruptcy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press icon , as they did not have during the 1975 referendum , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can be weak at Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name for themselves as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ins@@ an@@ ity Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking ali@@ ens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who have most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about them , but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle on the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly flap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff Ten@@ dency and the wild Gef@@ il@@ den of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ √§nder@@ ismus anyone can say yes to that .
it is what Hil@@ ary said &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ out fighting in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to stay under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all the reports at their meeting on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins surely thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ung economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military achievement in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something which was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lanc@@ et last month &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reached the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T on public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding it should have received by tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not provided , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of whom also provide a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting also took part in the tobacco line of P@@ he .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote the research work of the Group , stating that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence of most products in most of the criteria . &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prof. Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims were already re@@ acted in advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison with tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people die each year in a disease related to smoking , and smoking is the national health system worth two billion pounds per year .
by giving up @-@ to @-@ date proof that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we meet our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ wards , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ wards and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC that they are public law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from stations such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC general manager , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time with Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent which would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I consider medium or long @-@ term for a good idea , you should at least put your production on programs that others don &apos;t do or order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time slot , because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financing programs that could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ shore is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who conducted Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular shows reflect what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ wards .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their hypo@@ critical missions to justify 4 billion ¬£ radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all those obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call on you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you think all of us think that for 150 ¬£ every year you get a great value here , but for people who have a lot of money for the ¬£ 150 , ask me if that is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to verify their Rei@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example at the public television stations in Australia and Canada , &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful in television will be shown , and with the commercial channels Alli@@ ances enter in order to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they reson@@ ate with sound pulses , which have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching from Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react on ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound may be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noticed that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light , which has to be sent to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the arms trade fair - by creating an Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic shad@@ y company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ff@@ ing with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

what we need now is an intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally outside our front door .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student resi@@ dences ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sne@@ ak : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ ons , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly , Mar@@ mite do not love or hate , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn &apos;t talk to , even if your lashes were set on fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers were .
let people be .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and put their under@@ wear on .
referring to this : don &apos;t forget to start with a relationship at university
intro@@ vert has received a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many residence halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have spent on interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship with baking .
since you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and will probably associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead people to sleeping when they knock .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to handle more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people off from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors if it was something to make Drum &amp; Bass a little qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
they responded by listening to loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before she sl@@ um@@ ber@@ ed her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour trial .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally enter the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , turn to her , separate herself and then see her every day and perhaps witness how she moves all common friends to himself ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot fellow is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ cer and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good ang@@ st is funny , but it only takes moments before he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never trust someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but stap@@ le their possessions at the ceiling no more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , low ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor builds terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the single mother and the lesser ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show you how to build a good and affordable today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are displaced to the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ lis believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ deb@@ tor , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor : mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms does not have sustainability .
for people stay here for a great part .
in view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient housing in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ der : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when you put people in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can be rebuilt easily according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
did the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have correctly passed my project .
especially complicated there is always the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ l regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities the place is missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
guil@@ der : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what definitely is not right .
but do not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
mer@@ cen@@ aries : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but were built in luxury flats that hardly could afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the lesser ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build a good and cheap one today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they receive an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush is back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made this more impro@@ b@@ able by linking up the update . similarly , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may turn off mid@@ way and this may lead to break@@ age of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team@@ mates Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second st@@ alled before the start to the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion from the night race in Singapore this Sunday of title defender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far and also hit the Fl@@ ut@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year old Bri@@ t was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will affect Singapore &apos;s Grand Prix is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Schach@@ club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was founded three months ago and has added another member to his ranks , thus the membership number increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passion@@ ed chess and tennis player , who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the vehicle of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz ( Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz ) 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ √ºb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation received by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot get the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of its connection with the spa town .
lod@@ gings are looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the rest centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
besides consultations , one can also take part in courses there .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
right next to the purchasing market , senior citizens and counsel@@ ors will receive information on questions such as health care insurance or health care services .
for years we have established with our out@@ patient care service that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even so many services are not used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner , Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the civil hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training , or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is reflected in the demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedicated itself to the association in old age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the agenda and these invite to a regular convi@@ vial gathering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this gives the social foundation a great contribution to the fact that senior citizens can live as independent and well as possible in their familiar surroundings .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 am to 12 pm .

Vienn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang died 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienn@@ ese architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the K√ºnstler@@ haus distributed on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang the K√ºnstler@@ haus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as stated in the Foreign Office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical College in Vienna near Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 , he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s , he was commissioned with the establishment of the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg Palace of Vienna and the conversion of the Lob@@ ko@@ witz Palace into the Austrian Theatre Museum .

he wants to have added 30 kilograms of muscle mass according to his own statement in the past two years .
on the other hand , he has not admitted intellectu@@ ally .
in the inner city of Bremen , Wiese was cut off the hair when he saw how a parking guard outside saw a ticket for his white Chevrolet Cam@@ aro .

at the City of Bremen , the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the City of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that decision will be decided whether meadow will be shown , or not .

men beat a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and struck this with his fist .
the victim suffered a sl@@ ump in the nose and was bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpet@@ rator was following the group with a passenger car to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed over there several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the wounded went ahead of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male figure .
with the help of a stick @-@ stick , one applied to the face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim .
the injured one had to be brought to a hospital for medical care .
so far , only a vag@@ ue perpet@@ rator description is present .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asked witnesses and sign@@ ors to sign up at 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the field of Fel@@ steh@@ erer and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank M√ºller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ erer .
also the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing luck : there Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the practice of Fel@@ b@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ anch@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side with his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , M√ºller re@@ opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the rock faces met Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr. Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently completing their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and will also enter into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ erer and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I simply called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple M√ºller liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank M√ºller also grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as Senior Consul@@ tant in the Di@@ ep@@ holz Group and was engaged in a honorary position in the DR@@ K willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the new boss will be prepared for the new boss as of September 19th .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ erer works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the M√ºll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 year old Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
the M√ºll@@ ers receive a total of 50@@ 000 Euro as part of a subsi@@ dy programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ steh@@ hun@@ ath every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another dental practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ erer .
if no successor would have been found , she would have gone too .
if you visit M√ºll@@ ers &apos; consultation hour , you will continue to look at familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their farewell , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the medical doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stan@@ dig .
a little mel@@ anch@@ oly felt it already after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed myself before gardening , now it could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair enjoys two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also raised on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that anyone who wants to submit a asylum claim can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go for granted &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia considers &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to continue travelling in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , also er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
this is how the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar saw in Lai@@ bach , however , not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already highly controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to make his limits to refugees but not to abri@@ dge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must complete its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby fields of corn .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly meeting in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country will host about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would diver@@ t towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was to instruc@@ t people in propos@@ ing certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way through Serbia all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary did , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ located route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good report on the country since then , regarding the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Serbian side , about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early on a local note in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be about very high refugee numbers at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their trip on Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes have been marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mine fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of gaining insight into yet un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wired and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the exploited information , insi@@ der businesses should have been made to the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders can ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial against 32 further accused in the case lasted .
most of the defend@@ ants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are said to have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .

the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce drew attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is well confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we &apos;ve gone through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce assist the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations as the volunteer workers .
while some pass@@ ers @-@ by spontaneously joins the chal@@ k and &quot; affir@@ ms my life , &quot; &quot; can read &quot; with the camper through the US , &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the fr@@ inge of discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
even Peter H@@ √ºb@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic plant of Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband is the carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that everyone wants to communicate openly on the tablets is understandable , however , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still attached to tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even though the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped people to open up .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered his profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body@@ transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire around 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading in 45 minutes prior to the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in fiscal year , which ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts predicted 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 per cent and effective on January 4 , and despite higher bo@@ unds for bo@@ d@@ speakers of heavy and large packages , which will be raised in November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to lower costs , higher revenues and due to growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for vac@@ ation@@ ing were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labor force , approximately the same number as last year .
F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve analysts at Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts predicted six of Z@@ ack &apos;s expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit Express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result was lower due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the years Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the benchmark for the first time since almost a decade .
facing them at an end of the adorned , two @-@ story cour@@ se@@ room is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues intend to put the nation &apos;s economic interests in front of all the other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : keeping US jobs and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they are observing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently been questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an interest rate this week .
however , the financial markets expect a failure of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that indicates only a 30 % chance of increasing .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts reduce the strike by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value jumped by 21.@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy is holding the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would cancel the sentences at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an interest rate would calm the financial markets , because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that in this year despite the liber@@ als it would be necessary that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was always below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , although the Dow falls by almost 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this session , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in its decision @-@ making technically .
but in the end , the F@@ ed has become the world &apos;s biggest currency office .
over the past few years , the influence of the central bank has been enormous .
the mere reference to the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; her monetary expansion , triggered del@@ u@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements , which apparently are not linked to economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
pain@@ t@@ work , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which sets out for net interest rate , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a limited recognis@@ able impact on growth in the U.S. , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Finance of the Bank of England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il is not near this level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with her body and soul .
she is still very fond of her 74 li@@ ences .
every Thursday , she does it at the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Stra√üe .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite different teaching than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ al Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS aims to educ@@ ate women in sho@@ cking ways about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck on breasts which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary supplement that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat@@ ter for solar systems .
the planning for the long @-@ sigh@@ ted gym@@ nasi@@ um building on Bern@@ ese &apos;s sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal council session , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously agreed without great discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before that , the committee had , among other things , adopted an application for a statutory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectiv@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction was allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ bearing first and roof over@@ stand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings us together a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about til@@ ting , which for energy reasons - unlike the development plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the inclin@@ ation of the roof does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ ese community is generally more restric@@ tive in liber@@ ating applications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in the construction of rever@@ ber@@ ums , however , it is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at the expense , some 2.3 million euros are calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and broad@@ side sports .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be presented to the county office for testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital of P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of staff pull from P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is seen by the surprising plans of Hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board , and it will meet on Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , then all of the almost 50 staff at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play with the question of who is to follow the succession , who agreed to take the lead from October 1 and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a dis@@ sem@@ ination of the offer in the field &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fisher@@ man is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses , until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , shall be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation took place at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , chair@@ woman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ rat , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day@@ esp@@ sych@@ iat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something better could not happen to us , such an opportunity is not coming again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer on the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure over the last decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the handles of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
although the tab@@ ular leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , however , no one exists .
in the past season , the Bad@@ ener at Bh@@ c moved into a painful defeat and got something to do there .
Jag@@ ha@@ zy with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Wit@@ tenberg ) several hunters were in use , as the police announced .
after a shot , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered grave injuries and were taken to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ zei ( Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department ) was established .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victim of violent crimes
one of the susp@@ ects has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in interro@@ gation the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ utor and police announced on Wednesday .
as susp@@ icious , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , is also considered suspect and the investig@@ ator has led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , investig@@ ators first met the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
during interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ rator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
the det@@ ain@@ ee reported to the authorities in the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been killed and the cor@@ pse was put in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ lor@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a stop to him .
a decision on the immediate circumstances of the act should bring further investigations .
refugees need lodging : study warns of apartment gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking a paid stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be completed in Germany .
there@@ with 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in a first @-@ income accommodation .
many people come across the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant reductions in housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit , which grows from year to year .
currently , approximately 77@@ ,000 residential units have been missing in the con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations , compla@@ ins Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study .
that is why many professionals resi@@ ded in cities in need of shared rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained in@@ voluntarily longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the noise on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives will boost social housing construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the property tax should be dispens@@ ed with and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended for a limited period of time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the launch , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros was launched on Monday evening at ‚Ç¨ 18@@ 4 million .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free jurisdiction : Croatia and Slovenia judge Cor@@ ridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no escape to Hungary anymore , since more and more refugees choose their way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zagreb announces the granting of transit across Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have fled to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV station RT@@ L reports .
Hungary locked its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force on the same day are virtually eliminating decent asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare ourselves for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of them reported media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived with the bus as well as with taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across border f@@ ences .
the border strip har@@ bours other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance is now to quickly create a safe passage .
in Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
just before the closing on Monday it was 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws are committed to overcoming and damaging the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted threaten pen@@ alties of up to five years and expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit @-@ zones &quot; at the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically no one has a prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the shooting camps at the border point was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this conversion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reached a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government figures .
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived at regular intervals .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy clearing up ten people with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go to Passa@@ u by train .
because Germany was surprisingly dis@@ continued on Sunday because of the refugee flow with Austria , it was at the end of W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eur the rocks along the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
before that , we first j@@ erk@@ ed the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we have already said we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the train passengers str@@ anded on Sunday evening had moved from an ICE into a regional train in direction of Passa@@ u , in order to try it after the announcement that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still to try to cross the border .
the regional train , however , was set off at the border at W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Br√º@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ aly organized a two @-@ leg@@ ged run on Sunday - organized by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n is sending thousands of thousands to us now is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to note that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing influ@@ x of refugees and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for those seeking protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be even greater peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ solid districts
Konrad has all his hands to do with the provision of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place quarters for thousands of refugees .
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos in the first reception centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless anymore in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the housing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday would be without great fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects about 8@@ 5,000 districts to be lod@@ ged in the he@@ ur@@ y year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can create it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is no grass without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the main govern@@ ors .
these would have assured him , even for the coming refugees , to create quarters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s going well in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born who will be clari@@ fied how the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that qu@@ ads have to comply with a certain amount of the towel holders or the size of the harmon@@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad explained with his experience that in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he was more successful at the accommodation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier bear no costs in the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number to three to four .
up to now , your own qu@@ ad search has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being there is no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips arena and design center for accommodation of refugees plans the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since people are currently unable to submit these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , other locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
the city chief is critici@@ zing the division of the refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not locked &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial governor Josef P@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) has corro@@ ded further proceedings in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not locked .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
the protective looking @-@ seekers were , however , brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ √ºhr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence of the German action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industry line has been officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology Division .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup @-@ companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later also to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
‚Ç¨ 1.7 million has been invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ or opened second business in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop , ven@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni had to post@@ p@@ one this project in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , it now has gain in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the store , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around Dam@@ ian hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la brand , wall@@ ets are up to 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to ‚Ç¨ 500 .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long been thinking about opening a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among other things , the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz , who sell this stamp , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has got Br@@ eit from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are in rap@@ ture at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman cannot answer with the last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag uses every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ f√§l@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called en@@ co@@ ders .
this property also links some to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether it is alien@@ ating hostile , journalists r√º@@ e concerns or gaps in knowledge in international crisis politics , the candidate for the US presidential office is boo@@ sting the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ √§l@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate @-@ million@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ √∂hn@@ fres@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a concept many times in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant village is related to over -@@ zig verti@@ ces with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but are not so deeply impressed in their c@@ alle @-@ like manner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous shoots , to which besides Tr@@ ump is also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of his heart there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a bit of a big mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the radius , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ ary @-@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the en@@ co@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ ump therefore comes from the village of en@@ co@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the foundation stone of the real estate company was first real estate in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to home dur@@ ably failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then .
he did not receive Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for Pe@@ ul@@ tural History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he uphol@@ ds , this is not so pleasant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born trou@@ gh , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans rather dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so angry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family has donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally good .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
it would be better if he did not win the election because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA were like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says win@@ emaker Sarah B√ºh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels Film , for which Tr@@ ump has long been inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ o@@ irs , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavaria congregation of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park won the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the Swiss Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of the Liber@@ als leadership , but there have been no great shifts in the ratings for Today .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a week series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators in the five capitals , compared with today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today posted a slight increase over the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September Sun@@ rise stands on average 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ age Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down on New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ik star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong at 1.@@ 136 million spectators and hit the block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 a.m. to 5 : 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 40,000 spectators on average .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will confirm N@@ ine confi@@ dently that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that did not manage to over@@ flow the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who will win The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was covered with the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows a day before coming out of three two , you might accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood seals his lips tightly to the final on Thursday
all three women are ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as a reason why they want to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers could become a game corruption who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies noticed , I felt they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , then she was enig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a don@@ key as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by division conver@@ t on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a punch @-@ return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Mr Tom@@ sul@@ a encouraged Hay@@ ne to participate in his press conference .
the 49@@ er Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his crazy catch and to take care of the next game .

it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age hoped for his N@@ FL debut .

the Free Cho@@ ices demand the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Great Wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools if there were not corresponding new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free Cho@@ ices ad@@ jour@@ ned until Friday in the Frank@@ ish Commune .
in fact , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now also domin@@ ates the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as there were during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Cho@@ ose Head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the free elec@@ tors as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W chief critic@@ ised that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards for federal states in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become action @-@ capable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the national politics in Gro√ü@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a long @-@ term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ lasting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; favourite remains on the agenda : the education policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the new school year , Minister of Education Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Inter@@ mediate plus &quot; at 47 Gym@@ na@@ sien in which an extension of the secondary school age of three to four years is being tested .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock markets expect the markets to come forward until after the interest rate decision in the US and also to the large decline on the fut@@ ures trading on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after police shot rubber bul@@ lets at demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd prot@@ esting against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ el@@ ong@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station with some of them throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber floors .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber floors used are known to be able to kill , but they traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently producing such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern states , where members of the ethnic group of K@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed under the proposed new constitution , would l@@ essen their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century .
killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed by centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mix of trade , commerce and housing is planned , but there are still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den City wants to market some 4,000 square meters of land in close proximity to the Old Post Youth Centre .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mix of trade , commerce and living .
one is waiting for appropriate offers , it is called by the city .
which investor would come into question is not yet clear .
there were no treaties yet to be concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property located at the Ring@@ stra√üe / corner of Great Street , already a few months ago and demoli@@ shed the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure fee
for months , behind closed doors had been negotiated , gu@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System @-@ Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends from the system construction management went on to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects has been in discussion for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building were caused by fierce responses from the owners who came to the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the mer@@ maid and member of the board of directors of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a huge block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like some other project critics that the traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole loads to be reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what is happening on exactly one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ trends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / were doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years Adi@@ posit@@ as has proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan , Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital , used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 , comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c disease - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly the same with 29 .
among those who underwent surgical intervention , 36 % had diabetes and 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was only one percent and partially at only two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c fell by approximately 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , it remained stable at around 8 percent in the medical treatment group .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , according to the researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater reg@@ ression in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and reported rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was among obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long before we make people take it seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have fixed their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r√ºck
it is an issue that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets after years the s@@ warm of her youth , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently released novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ r√ºck readers , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ wei@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the killing in their countries is less@@ ened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama spoke of the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
four @-@ fold increase in the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centers in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years who swallow strongly alcoholic hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of income of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centers report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children intentionally drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berries , grapes and oran@@ ges which are very attractive for children .
hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip Whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ringe from straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to treatment in an emergency .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor treating them at the G@@ winn@@ ings Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ul@@ led her words and was not able to walk as she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had pushed his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ant clo@@ ths and store hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with death cases via alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol that was listed as an ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by applying anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the secret plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and instructed disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no more highlights from the Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ √∂ and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen followed , which now stands at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it just like that - but we must go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully during January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he ha@@ sten@@ ed a couple of January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about signing new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic destination Mich@@ u with reference note
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ St√ºr@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les for two years and has not made the departure from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts set on S@@ FA @-@ battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts took 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Red card of the defender was later removed - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son stops what he said and insisted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no performance commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the incor@@ rigi@@ ble hi@@ bee was re@@ buff@@ ed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the St√ºr@@ mer , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s management board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but it is said that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately needed to fight against Hamilton &apos;s policies in order to see a seventh consecutive division victory , giving them a lead of five points before Celtic on the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , who haven &apos;t won the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is growing overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period of May to July , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the 5.5 percent of U@@ K@@ s , as shown by the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ON@@ S ) .
meanwhile employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken interfer@@ ed with the process
as the security guards were unable to satisfy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray , the function@@ aries could take the stur@@ geon in awareness .

why I am witness to an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I &apos;ll sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications available than places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery is taking place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship during the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours of attendance .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to which you can turn to this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man persu@@ ades police persecution to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just a few meters from a police officer attempting to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale called for a house arrest incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to escape from alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threaten to end the race
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobal@@ t test specimen at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying repro@@ aches and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about this , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the Integ@@ rit@@ √§@@ ts department had attempted to spy on his stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still today .
should this make me think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people responsible outside trainers for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they must take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say can now be thought about .
but I arrived at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trainers &apos; frustr@@ ations have developed with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t investigation , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s hand , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues mistakenly applied mud on the leg .
it could have been like this last night .
it could have been like yesterday all day , which was so .
but it had it on the race day as well .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules don &apos;t know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man det@@ ained after driver &apos;s flight
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycli@@ st and subsequently driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram .
the cycli@@ st was hospit@@ alized with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the car driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .
on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia reported to the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged with driver cur@@ ses and lower aid and other traffic off@@ ences .
the cycli@@ st , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable condition .
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy fights against ri@@ vals because of alle@@ gations relating to ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised his players as an &quot; agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring Games &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed Note to the Storm team after his team scored the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ aber@@ g of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team is confident , as it means that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always appears again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about w@@ rest@@ ling when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ cles a real focus , and that has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . so he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this time always appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne told him that he will take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and that we look at as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy has also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks making and no points anything exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team has released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening in the final final in A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery
a man who may have a lifetime penalty due to his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and landed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the caf√© could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ ent declarations of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ts his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and is at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : driving cab apart
on Tuesday evening , a truck driver was seriously injured in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to leave the last moment to the left , as the police announced .
the driver &apos;s cab of the crash culp@@ ture tore completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
the result was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to sending images
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ d used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone as she slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches , which used terms for the search for invisible images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , - that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the search on the computer was carried out by him , but said that it was happening because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was ill in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the uns@@ ett@@ led images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the spirit of the indictment to have taken in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to have bre@@ ached the conditions and not appeared before court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit in this case but was kept in custody because of hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was still included in the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the judgement .
Schle@@ us@@ ers@@ leben based on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left people out of fear of discovery and arrest more and more at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the Land@@ kreise of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot via bridges and bar@@ rage on the German side .
they are received by Federal Police Offic@@ ers and for@@ warded to the registration process .
in comparison to the beginning of the week on Wednesday , the Munich Main Railway Station saw clearly more refugees .
about 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 AM , a spokesman said in the morning .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the Franco @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : drop@@ out of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tropical storm in the southwest awaits &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart .
the strong low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; who had gone over the Atlantic over the past days from the Bermuda Islands .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , on Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday , the sun shines longer again .
the mass is doing it : every two years the coaches show their novel@@ ties at the IA@@ A .
in 2015 , it is above all a movement among the compact cars , which are currently selling particularly well .
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : some 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of Technology ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , a number of new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the premi@@ er premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the fall .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel is launching an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost ‚Ç¨ 16@@ 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , H@@ esse offers additional diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are included for the first time .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only a five @-@ door model .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IA@@ A .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra ri@@ vals M√©@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and emphas@@ ised sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan depos@@ itor wants to find his position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is visible at the IA@@ A .
on the outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ √´@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ er set hand in front of the front part . here , the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of super@@ visions and new variants , such as the fresh@@ ened Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the judicial enforcement agency Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision which was published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man who now finds himself on the free foot , according to his lawyer , has been transferred to a larger cell .
his detention facility was failing because of the di@@ gni@@ fied detention conditions against the country of Berlin .
however , the Constitutional Court rel@@ inqu@@ ished the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber court decides on the amount of compensation now
even if for legal reasons , only a few days of detention for compensation were author@@ it@@ ative of the question@@ able period , it was said to be compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear the legal protection of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the constitutional judges have often reinforced the rights of prisoners .
thus they spoke in April a prisoner of compensation because he was locked in a cell naked .
according to a decision by 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing on a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the Pla@@ inti@@ ff , then , was lod@@ ged daily between 15 and 21 hours a day in a homo@@ geneous cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin j@@ ails have also hit the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to missing personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore trapped again and again 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to temples it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of junior lack , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , about 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany this year , according to Deputy Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany is the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but above all in affordable rental properties : every year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing from the rental prices drop out , and these particularly cheap apartments will also apply for refugees .
German Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
far too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing needs to be created annually , and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
at the same time , scientists and the Federal Minister of Education agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in housing construction .
according to the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 percent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany wouldn &apos;t be asked systematically for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ √§n@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of working for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on working for asylum seekers of up to five years , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence requirement that asylum seekers are confined to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled workers , there has been a majority in the view that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
so far there is not enough offer of general and job @-@ related language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is the king &apos;s path to work integration .
the Berlin School administration has found that only a few adults have given their children to the kit@@ tens , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents , it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes towels in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in the lessons .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle no federal state explicitly prohi@@ bits asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has abandoned his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prepar@@ atory refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a compensation or toler@@ ation do not receive any services according to the asylum seekers &apos; laws of asylum if they begin a study .
the latter , in principle , do not receive a b@@ ail , since they do not fall under the circle of eligible persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this span will shor@@ ten to 15 months .
but this gap has to be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ √∂@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually ev@@ acu@@ ate the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and develop the existing state @-@ churches right to a new state @-@ religious relationship .
it is also important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights also include duties .
so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and grant him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to lodge against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to impose such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
in future , integration will be a topic of society as a whole .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders show that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants organizations and the non @-@ white German advoc@@ acy groups have long demanded and what international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ist convention Germany commit must become reality in the coming years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens want to use its possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical support to the previously expected refugees , says Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ power and capacities are concerned , we do that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money would have to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls on all the newcom@@ ers to issue health cards right away .
services rendered could later be rep@@ uted to the federal states .
and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to cast away so many people with the limited performance catalogue that the asylum application law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , doctors primarily make the language barriers created .
as early as so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting worse about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs have to be taken over .
many refugees would also be helped by more general medical centers in emergency out@@ patient clinics .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV @-@ awareness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the partially other diseases , German doctors come from their training but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the doctors &apos; angel , the refugees may even see relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a sophisticated educational system , several refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therapist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong sc@@ el@@ iness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , early treatment is necessary , says Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can apply for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly cler@@ ical workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new production &quot; passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sings and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on a brick and was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift to am@@ ate@@ urs is therefore in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take away the people from their everyday mo@@ ck@@ ery and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus program convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , it wants to record the Cuban duo in a relaxed manner .
ease and agi@@ lity - with these words , they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is intended to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with a touch of intuition and arti@@ fici@@ ality , except through numerous salmon @-@ sal@@ ts .
balance with the fl@@ y@@ wheel on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake @-@ people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with its mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t go well either . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each match @-@ unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be read off by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
so the first commandment : to be good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all our heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks at its performances from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 : 00 p.m .
on Sunday , the program ki@@ cks off at 11 : 00 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5@@ pm the prices are reduced .
furthermore , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holds false speech in parliament &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , dropped the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the Parliament was also v@@ ested by claims of de@@ pu@@ ties of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with calls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , they had rested and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones , warned against disturbing Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members concerned that immunity ends in parliament , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokesman said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for the politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will be building up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing enterprise hardware and service activities .
expected job cuts result in a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; an explanation of the company .
it shares a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage one called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this sector , based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsenal Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta tells team@@ mates to stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb after the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation continues according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already implies that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his involvement in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries whenever a player attempts to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 out of arsen@@ als in 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader image for arsen@@ al is that they were one of the two premi@@ er league clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , which recorded the most vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement will continue in the injury rate during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to embar@@ k on a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 matches after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League Capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and is driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the association to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
it has never worked out in Arsenal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , how self @-@ mor@@ bid among young men prove on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged between 20 and 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m Campa@@ ign against a miserable life ) was announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of questioning the culture that men hin@@ der from seeking help when they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ re@@ piece of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school pupils with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had an adequate high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication guided through social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation is dominated .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one by the interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the y@@ earning of Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can definitely relate to them , even if they often stop to explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how a staff of phone pastoral care told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am cop@@ ing with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status on the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , when you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the set @-@ up backdrop for the celebration of the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G mal@@ ign Malm@@ √∂
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ √∂ .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass Malm@@ √∂ .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion on the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their advantage when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and hor@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it is not only striving to qualify for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it wasn &apos;t a classic game from Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed chances ahead of the goal . he was later replaced in play against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . that &apos;s why it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris @-@ Team in one of three changes that could last weekend a 2 : 2 Draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the first division , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm became known as the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he went inside Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defense before he finished to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ √∂ , who beat Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this stage , joined with nine national players on the field and was with a five man defense and two deep in the middle field str@@ ung a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed away at Kevin Tra@@ pps Post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up himself , with some mis@@ h@@ ass@@ les and bad degrees , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , turning Di Maria into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate finally dropped shortly after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth seasonal gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ √∂ could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and out of the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi recognized a goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glen@@ core collects US $ 2.5 billion by selling shares

the company Glen@@ core , registered in London , said in an explanation that it has sold new shares worth approximately EUR 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts .
the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is fighting with falling commodity prices as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn push@@ es demand and has a devastating effect on markets .

Glen@@ core last week had announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices around half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the Al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner of champi@@ ons , four times champion league winners , two times champion league champion , twice world champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the now 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now advises that he was already before the European Championship before the farewell to Barcelona .
&quot; they told me that Bar@@ √ßa wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid didn &apos;t win anything at that time , &quot; he says .
and this was also the case of Bayern Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in memory : in the summer of 2008 J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann acquired the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has signed Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I have played a great European championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , the red ones out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
Matt Dam@@ on Pla@@ ys Di@@ versity in Film Production
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown canc@@ eled when this emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it with the occupation of the film and not in the lin@@ eup of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian captured him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how to treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a nurse , beaten by her white sugar .
the producer of Dear White People sat on the film for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o . Dam@@ on said their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved national impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to put discri@@ min@@ atory practices against fer@@ vor .
in February the singer Prince made a recording of the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album quiet matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned the first champion
professional sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
the competition show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
to the last task , climbing was part of a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task at the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! news of the hard won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went to The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any res@@ ent@@ ment over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by somebody , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field .
the T@@ wins offered a chance to climb inside a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word , which was so difficult to handle over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tiger manager Brad Ex@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained its early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings 6 times and enabled three rings .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit play by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( kick training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Field Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape to the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the closing @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe played a Double Play .
at the end of the ninth dormit@@ ory Detroit added a high @-@ quality insurance @-@ run , Berlin created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ do and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava .
at the beginning of the game , Detroit benefited from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injuries list before the game , after he had been missing more than one month because of a back pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch as in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ush gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with Run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a great blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he got the right job .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ever right handed A.@@ J@@ .A@@ rum .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns in six hits and a Walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter school .
he is being investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ tie , is supposed to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is stri@@ pped of the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to come to Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , like the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 refugees arriving .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily sign up there .
they should then be distributed to other local authorities .
in the last ten days alone 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse arrived in Hessen , according to the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ r√§si@@ dium , responsible for the initial up@@ take .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also established emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German military measures in Syria an option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Collec@@ tive Wa@@ iting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of military involvement has passed to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive escal@@ ation of international aid on the ground for refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany did not send any refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s been agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there had already been talks between the general manager for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their goal is mostly Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee center in Germany , the League wants to support the countries more strongly in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel on Tuesday evening after almost four hours of deliber@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection were also compla@@ ining this too .
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was unanim@@ ously dealt with in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort of force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could also be equipped with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking emergency routes over Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who cut the fence .
in Turkey meanwhile tens of thousands of migrants reported thousands of migrants on their way to the Greek border .
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sp@@ lashes out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the moon is therefore easily stag@@ gering on its track around the ring planets .
although this motion of exchange is only small , but still too large for a permanently solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is stated in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) on Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds that sp@@ ew water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .

an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced .
R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Munich lion , the diagnosis means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g√º@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a non @-@ professional professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no Di@@ et Fruit - Man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line will often get dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially sac@@ char@@ ose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits are thus supporting vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly smell .
the peel color alone doesn &apos;t say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure , of course , or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US package service U@@ PS again provides up to 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the United States .

first fo@@ il@@ storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ ine@@ ord@@ side of the F@@ √∂hn winds through , as met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland shared on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the hair @-@ dryer blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ eh@@ nel @-@ valleys .
after F@@ √∂hn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a decrease in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the west side of the Alps the F@@ √∂hn winds its way through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the hair @-@ dryer blows in the tran@@ fer valleys with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h until Thursday morning , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can penetrate to the adjacent medi@@ ell@@ and in places , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dri@@ es for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow away at the slope of the Alps .
here rain starts , which stops until Thursday evening .
in total , south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , with some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter , this is due to the fact that large amounts of rain have already fallen in recent days .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ √∂hn winds up the air , as a result a cold front rolls with strong , partly ge@@ wit@@ ty pier@@ ced rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind is refresh@@ ed strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures go back clearly .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of President Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in secret in the pop@@ es over centuries .
with the square , it is symboli@@ cal that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a de@@ pra@@ ved sin ba@@ bel .
according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then introduced the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the decline in taxes .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the golden crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar Old Testament , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 designs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year old - but this is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it may seem rather ble@@ ak .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; Book of all Books . &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics like cross @-@ path , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
he has been fascinated by several partners spontaneously : this is true for Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publisher with its focus on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and so into today , translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible text of Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family owned by the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to work with the Lord too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; the perception of worlds of image is shaped today by advertising , and that is loud .
symbo@@ lis@@ m is displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to let the viewer fall into the images , let them appear , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image looks for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art had been : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ ends life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not pay attention to completely capture the Bible , but also selected the mysterious themes that were important to him .
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text merely explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( BM@@ X )
plans made , space was found , companies commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a round course : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was finished .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration caused ent@@ ang@@ lement , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will take place in October , the first community mate Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to share with her children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started with the work of the former indoor swimming pool without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further stop &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend .
the football responds to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politicians to help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe this for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing for me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest every individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B leader Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the minister of state Ms √ñ@@ z@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the crucial turn@@ out must be politics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; explained Nier@@ s@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal lists also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will carry the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di V√∂l@@ ler from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football feder@@ ations , no , we have to use our brilli@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ id@@ s@@ bach designated the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licenses had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association with the DF@@ B election and the German federal government each provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the entire sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in case of an accident
the head of head of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye because of a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he dropped to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost blood@@ shed , fain@@ ted , then dra@@ gged out on the road - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will return to Germany in October and continue the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus versus Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wick@@ er plate in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well as in the du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga Top Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high strain of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change its root 11 on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change to the goal keeper position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of family @-@ keepers Roman Br@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether wil@@ low eller will be used in all Europa League games in the future , however , Tu@@ chel has left open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ceful statement by fellow player R@@ eus that the final trigger for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , mi@@ dd@@ le@@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl considers understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot@@ ics : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of cars .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the house of transport minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; new mobility era &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ) .
among other things , the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport under@@ lines the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy switch to digital radio communication .
there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government intends to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make sure that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles is lifted from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
the Federal Government is also planning to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages man as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically feasible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be expected far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
yet the Germans are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey carried out on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the research organization Dec@@ ra concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect to believe it at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed see up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 per cent in the US .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , while in traffic jam 45 per cent .
good every fourth would give the car the control under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ Euro
according to current status , the D√ºsseldorf @-@ based D√ºsseldorf plans to beat only in singles , from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision should be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have learned it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf , during the European Championships in D√ºsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed point of sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Single European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ am@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the European Championships 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ranking Five . &quot; &quot; &quot;

they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he was stuck in skir@@ ts .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 onwards in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , one comes to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having a training .
chron@@ ologically the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall artwork for which much effort has been carried out : to fr@@ ori@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was specially hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , 14 tonnes of material was bar@@ red to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants out@@ fits with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ bull &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , quar@@ rel@@ some fashionable attempts by the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and ill in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , told Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later released the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , including Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
he did not have to pay the models for his first own fashion show .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewel instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as a fashion niche
in the past it was about long sti@@ fl@@ ing machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they used for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en fashion store .
instead fashion is important again .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze fashion played a major role , was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt men@@ tions some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that leans against past stem@@ med epo@@ chs is an increasing order potential .
anyone who does not have a niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
in cooperation with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialty stores and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass @-@ produced goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , exports are weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ s√§ch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
in order to counter the competition from the Asian region one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter has rev@@ amped the historic snow@@ ball point .
at the same time , the machine sticks out small chi@@ cks at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ √üe took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewellery .
in an elaborate process , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ dry Sp@@ itz - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not supposed to be touched , but Disney even vent@@ ures to a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , it is not about a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first movie with the magical child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already standing : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to expand wider to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was t@@ asked with the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new businesses and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a series of directives , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the local reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is tested and tested by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it has a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a right @-@ wing government environment and stream@@ lining the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government will also ease controls on the powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the ri@@ ghtful interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thereby expect a significantly higher dose of nerve growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer Organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding work paper on the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of wrong industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , large predat@@ ory fish have already been so heavily poll@@ uted with mercury that , on the basis of the still applicable limit values , about 50 percent of catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ ec@@ ured .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller fish species such as car@@ p are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of the rh@@ einf@@ all is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distra@@ ction , which alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly po@@ ison@@ ous to humans , which are heavily enriched in predat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts can be caused particularly in un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on its homepage , the Federal Environment Ministry declares that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by the carbon burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations come to the Green Party MP Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock in more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount emit@@ ted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube , was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and region@@ ally exceeded &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings against mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
