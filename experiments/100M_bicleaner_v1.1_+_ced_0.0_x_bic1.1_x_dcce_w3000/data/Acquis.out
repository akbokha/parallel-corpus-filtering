on request of the Organization , the Community or a State , consultations take place on questions resulting from the interpretation or application of the Convention .
the Community and States are entitled to request that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of the Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the concerned State to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes relating to an establishment of the Council in accordance with Article 19 or a decision taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be settled upon application of an arbit@@ ral tribunal by a party consisting of five arbitr@@ ators .
the Community and the States appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organisation also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth which pres@@ i@@ des .
if the Community and the States or the Organization have not designated two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for an arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure is to be applied if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent , and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the concerned states .
( a ) This Convention applies to non @-@ nuclear states , the contracting party of the Treaty and become members of the Community , in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization is not@@ ated that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of the Convention and
II ) When the Association of the Organization notes that it is able to apply its safegu@@ ards in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties concerning a change of this convention .
B ) All amendments require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The General Director immediately instruc@@ ts all Member States of the Organization from any amendment to this Convention .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement signi@@ fies the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied when implementing the provisions of the Part I on securing measures .
the purpose of the method of securing measures specified in this agreement is the timely discovery of the jun@@ cture of significant amounts of nuclear activities of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence of such bran@@ ching by the risk of early discovery .
to obtain the target defined in article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , composite with spatial input and observation as important complementary measures .
the technical termination of the ex@@ ams by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which material quantity is not specified for any material balance sheet stating the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
when performing their check @-@ up , the organization is making full use of the security system of the community after Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the core material Community in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
in the application of their securing measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and they , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are intended and useful in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system for determining the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock ;
B ) the assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of tran@@ smit@@ ters and receivers ;
( e ) Proced@@ ure to assess accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system that displays the core material inventory and the changes in this stock , including the one and outputs of the material balance zone , for any material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reporting reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this agreement do not apply to material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) if the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) is not yet reached , the Community of the Organization shares the quantity and composition of the material provided that it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope en@@ rich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured , or is incorporated into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this agreement .
a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the conditions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the association is not possible or desirable in Article 11 , therefore the organization and community consult each other for the use of suitable securing measures .
B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree unanim@@ ously that this core material is virtually non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
at the request of the community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures according to this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when it is used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if nuclear material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this agreement , of these securing measures , provided that the entire material quantity liberated by this Article in the States is not at any time more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Uran@@ ium with a rich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with en@@ rich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with en@@ rich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of en@@ rich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if freed core material is to be processed or stored along with core material , which is subject to the securing measures according to this agreement , provisions for the re @-@ use of the securing measures will be met on that material .
the community meets with the organization supplementary agreements that are necessary to determine the extent necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization according to this agreement , in the individual determining how the procedures specified in the Convention are applicable .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without any amendment to the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this convention . the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts to make these agreements enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of the agreement ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
the organization , based on the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , represents a consolidated inventory of the entire nuclear material in the States , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory due to the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ran@@ s@@ problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central b@@ ind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organization of the EEC has presented a table from which it is pur@@ pos@@ ely intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organization arran@@ ges a special account under the name &quot; Special Account &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States will contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; administrators &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the Special transaction account is separated and managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the member state , which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state at order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organization of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , and ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrative appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the bai@@ li@@ ff , taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may , upon request , make payments before the aforementioned term .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes approximately proportion@@ ate drawing on the cash or the school notes to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in case of granting loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC :
( III ) the extent in which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional capacity to loan loan terms without dis@@ counted ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the affected countries settle by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ ectable development program or sub@@ project ( including a sec@@ toral proposal ) , which is considered , approved , approved and managed according to the procedures and practices applied to the fund financed by ordinary funds of the organization , which is to be considered in the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the Special Action Account may not be used instead of the funds of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions , which apply to the development loan granted by the organization ; thus they are ref@@ und@@ able in ten free years respectively in 50 years .
a special transaction loan is granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay for this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that retains it .
each special transaction loan shall be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is given .
the income from any special transaction loan can be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services ( ii ) in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator set at the time of the loan granted , could be the recipient of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount ref@@ unded in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back to the Member State after its receipt as soon as possible .
until full allocation of all special transaction loans , the bai@@ li@@ ff will instruc@@ t the EEC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors for the examination by the directors .
during the period of payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator instruc@@ ts the E@@ EA quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
as soon as possible , the administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed settlement of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization for this account termination .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC as soon as possible provides a detailed report on the plans and programmes financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and conduc@@ ts appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , resulting from the accounts payable to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are visible .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker to the complete issu@@ ance of the funds of the Special Action Account from time to time will exchange information about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organisation may agree , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be invalid with immediate effect .
if the total capital amount of all special transaction loans claimed by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the Govern@@ ments of the Member States shall note the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the regular approval of this agreement by the EEC to the organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of entry of the mentioned noti@@ fications at the organization .
this agreement is written in two manus@@ cripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , each wor@@ ding is equally authentic .
whereas the agreement is concluded in the form of a correspondence to am@@ end the An@@ nex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T has issued the following UN@@ MO@@ TION :

any party party may termin@@ ate this agreement at any time with a period of six months .
in the form of a correspondence to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in order to simplify the procedure for the adaptation of tari@@ ff tari@@ ff desig@@ nations in the event of renewed changes to the tari@@ ff agreement of one of the contracting parties in the future , it appears further to include an article 12 to the agreement .
I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes and propose to you as an appointment for entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm with me the consent of your government to the foreg@@ o@@ ing .
I honor to confirm you the receipt of your present letter with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the Member States &apos; demands within the medium @-@ term financial state
the B@@ IS could close stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks provide a corresponding request .
the agreements could be concluded until the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future stand @-@ up funds of the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned , for which the BI@@ Z would be ready .
with each Stand@@ by credit , the B@@ IS would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renewal , without having to exceed five years altogether .
at the opening of the loans and their event@@ ual extension the BI@@ Z would calculate a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing will not be made prior to exp@@ iry of a month after the Stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity .
the drawing would be made available at the end of the agreement at the end of the agreement , probably in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that were to be dealt with considering the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
conditions would correspond to those who use the BI@@ Z at the appropriate time on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
if the BI@@ Z has to acquire the necessary funds on the market , then the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the corresponding margin raised by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could close stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks provide a corresponding request . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am honored to give you the approval of the Council of the European Communities for the content of this writing .

recognizing the fact that the sheep economy and exports of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are vital to the world market and in particular after the community for the New Zealand economy and that it is necessary to ensure that the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honour the following agreements :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or frozen h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
according to this agreement New Zealand is ensured for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat access to the market of the community in the amount specified in the agreement .

taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as for slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will be carried out only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of community in world trade with these products .
new Zealand ensures compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 in particular , that there are no export licenses beyond these quantities .
in turn , the Community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand is made dependent on the submission of an export licence , which is given by the competent authority notified by the New Zealand government .

- Fro@@ zen H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat ( tari@@ ff 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Custom@@ s tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual amount according to the Community :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is obliged to ensure by appropriate procedures that the actual amount of the annual amount does not exceed the agreed amount and is executed according to the usual forms of supply ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
should a change in the supply form be made as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the Committee mentioned below , in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community takes the protection clause , it under@@ takes to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that the imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year concerned .
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products collected by this agreement on a par value of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the quantity established under number 2 according to the scope of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this is taken into account under the number 5 of the Supreme Court of Ex@@ haus@@ tion .
the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is set on the day of the Greek accession to the community at 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ asses .
the community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid market development which might affect the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb di@@ lig@@ ently on the community market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community makes arrangements so that the sales of intervention residues on frozen meat are not under@@ mined by the implementation of the Ord@@ in@@ ance to the sales of Urugu@@ ay@@ an workers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as for slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will be carried out only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of community in world trade with these products .
these terms must be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention concerning the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that within the quantities stated in this agreement , export licenses are issued for the products mentioned under number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in turn , the Community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Uruguay is made dependent on the submission of an export licence , which is designated by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in addition , the administrative authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals specifies the quantities for which export licenses have been issued ; these data may , if necessary , be de@@ cryp@@ ted to destination country .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Austria and Uruguay on the other hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government with this letter .

a re@@ agent for blood @-@ group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance specified on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the way recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is comp@@ uted exclusively by volume of the flow of blood cells in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents to be used on slides , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te sedi@@ mentation .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mix within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the restoration of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison with the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B Sing@@ ers contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available for free from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should remain unchanged for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the durability tests ; it must be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 BC of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent delivered with dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origin for blood @-@ group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , whether in a liquid form or after recovery , must be transparent and must neither contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for the international exchange of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination are to be distributed in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount within a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records on all stages of production and control of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents are stored for a long time from the laboratory until a certain probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood @-@ group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary tools for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their active part in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
each container is black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed for recovery ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed for recovery ,
each consi@@ gn@@ ment shall be accompanied by a certificate pursuant to Article 4 of the Convention according to the arrangement of this protocol .
