<seg id="728">The organization, based on the initial report mentioned in Article 62, represents a consolidated inventory of the entire nuclear material in the States, regardless of its origin, and continues to carry out this inventory due to the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organization (Organisation) on the other hand</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by general ressourcentransproblems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central bindings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organization of the EEC has presented a table from which it is purposely intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization arranges a special account under the name "Special Account" which consists of the funds that the Member States will contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement (in this capacity the organization is referred to as "administrators"), and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The Special transaction account is separated and managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest notes of the member state, which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state at order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organization of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment is made in two installments, and (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the fee within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrative appointed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the bailiff, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may, upon request, make payments before the aforementioned term.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes approximately proportionate drawing on the cash or the school notes to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In case of granting loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent in which international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its additional capacity to loan loan terms without discounted; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent in which the problems of the affected countries settle by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expectable development program or subproject (including a sectoral proposal), which is considered, approved, approved and managed according to the procedures and practices applied to the fund financed by ordinary funds of the organization, which is to be considered in the letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the Special Action Account may not be used instead of the funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions, which apply to the development loan granted by the organization; thus they are refundable in ten free years respectively in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">A special transaction loan is granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to pay for this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that retains it.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each special transaction loan shall be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the funds is given.</seg>
<seg id="751">The income from any special transaction loan can be used for expenditures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services (ii) in a member state; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which, according to what the administrator set at the time of the loan granted, could be the recipient of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account, and the amount refunded in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back to the Member State after its receipt as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until full allocation of all special transaction loans, the bailiff will instruct the EEC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors for the examination by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator instructs the EEA quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenditures made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible, the administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed settlement of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external auditors of the organization for this account termination.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC as soon as possible provides a detailed report on the plans and programmes financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and conducts appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, resulting from the accounts payable to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States are visible.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretakers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker to the complete issuance of the funds of the Special Action Account from time to time will exchange information about the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date, which the EEC and the Organisation may agree, the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be invalid with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total capital amount of all special transaction loans claimed by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
