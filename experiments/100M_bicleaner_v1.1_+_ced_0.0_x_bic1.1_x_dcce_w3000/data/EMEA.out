this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies conducted in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablet tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. turbul@@ ent thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , a mental disorder where patients have alternate episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal tuning .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and proph@@ yl@@ actic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ oral disorders if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or the melting tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are broken down just as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this im@@ pairs the transmission of signals between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably acts primarily as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less measure than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting from increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with placebo .
in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over 12 weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ oper@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder resulting from increased distur@@ b@@ ance associated with lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic drug ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responded to the treatment was investigated .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution to intake .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg had a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased distur@@ b@@ ance than the patients receiving placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously untreated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al disorders ( nausea ) , nausea , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes spoke to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were out@@ weighed against the risks .
in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in quick monitoring of increased distur@@ b@@ ance and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes spoke to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a daily maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the incidence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of su@@ ici@@ dal with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , consider reducing the dose or stopping the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ n , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ oti@@ ka , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be dismissed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who permit direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regards to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reduc@@ tions .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites .
considering the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should be out@@ weighed by the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar doses .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
because of the insufficient data situation for the safety of humans and concerns caused by the animal reproductive studies , this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against using dangerous machines , including vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative effect on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a generally lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with Hal@@ oper@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment was 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled trial of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with Hal@@ oper@@ dol treatment was .
in another study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treated .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and their incidence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , undes@@ ired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
there are no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hi@@ stam@@ ine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of binding of 11@@ C Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , at the nucleus cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ amen .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a Hal@@ oper@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ der patients who had a response to the study were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ oper@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depression rates , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ oper@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal &apos; weight gain &apos; was , significantly fewer patients gain a gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dose over 3 weeks involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of Lithium or Hal@@ oper@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ oper@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which in some over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients receiving a re@@ mission during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superi@@ ority in the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ apse into man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ li@@ zation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ulation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l for extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as did not show any gender @-@ dependent effects in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients .
a simulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) did not show a significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional research on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so that they have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects include a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10@@ x of the mean ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
furthermore , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose for humans ( based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human G@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contain no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to exposure of 3 and 11 times of the mean ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were compared with a dose of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 In addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose for humans ( based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to exposure of 3 and 11 times of the mean ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and started with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection in the del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ v@@ ection of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drug used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if an advanced oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy processed tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution for taking .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ oral disorders that were otherwise caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution as necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution is not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .

clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonom@@ ic inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regards to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was larger compared to that after every dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly used as one @-@ time indication and simultaneously received the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .

other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar doses .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .

110 and behavi@@ oral disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant significant improvements of ag@@ ility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders combined with placebo and was similar to Hal@@ oper@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ oral disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in the symptoms of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am reference arm .
the mean improvement from bas@@ eline value on P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar efficacy was observed with regard to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a Hal@@ oper@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ der patients who had a response to the study were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ) and Hal@@ oper@@ dol 73 % .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg depression rates , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ oper@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which in some over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week extension of study in some patients receiving a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ apse , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ apse into man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % bigger the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time to achieve the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly about the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following intraven@@ ous application , there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bit ) about the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; hence , they have limited or no significance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
furthermore , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times of the recommended maximum dose for humans ( based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to exposure of 3 and 11 @-@ times of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study on which 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer participated , of which about three quarters had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) was compared with a drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
considering only those patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel drugs .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that , unlike other pac@@ lit@@ axel drugs , it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued approval to the Abra@@ x@@ ane Company of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or serious sens@@ orial neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in sensor@@ ic neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached on degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on recommen@@ ding dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ arti@@ kel@@ formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have substantially other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils rise again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes rise again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is not proven , cardiac ab@@ norm@@ alities in the indicated patient group are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there are nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in the patient after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ eme@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to give no child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm conservation , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect the traffic and the ability to operate machines .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gy , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , painful g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ es in the mouth , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of the muscles , pain in the body , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , back pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive example in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the ag@@ gregation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ ms and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by blocking its dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital intervention and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in in @-@ vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ in receptor and due to the alb@@ um@@ in protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ armed un@@ obstruc@@ ted studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III study study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for over 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in the form of a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ ases and 19 % because of metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for ab@@ ring on bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 courses of treatment was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel following 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) following the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) compared to a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher in Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ aboli@@ zed with 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected from light light for 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogenic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the water flow bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the water @-@ through bottle should be swi@@ vel@@ ed slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is done .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for placing on the market will provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the features of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging . • With a clear imaging of the correct application of the product , cooling boxes provided for transport by the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicines &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels that could occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided they have received an appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used against operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference medicinal product when administered as an injection in a vein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either transferred to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed the European Union has demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that makes Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medic@@ inal P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG approval for the launch of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( such as cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in planned major surgical procedures that require a large volume of blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large electro @-@ orthop@@ a@@ edic operation in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients in which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in one patient .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage can be reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest licensed dose , which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and the symptoms of an@@ emia .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest licensed dose required to control the symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l over the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the number of readings of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of readings of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes around &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ser@@ ration is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into circulation .
patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin at ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive any Ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ cally known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not able to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sive disease , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ an or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recently entered heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as a reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the measured value should be determined and the common causes for a non @-@ response ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ity , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; Index &quot; ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , which is found to be found in thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers , and if no other cause of a loss of effect is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ cy@@ te antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit due to the addition of epo@@ e@@ ines if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 is not to be exceeded .
according to the current findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in patients with chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be taken into account for a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly , if possible , before the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis since they have increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events is possible for patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy if ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumour tissue , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
about thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ oses , vascular thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys has been reported in patients under Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically @-@ derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ulated and is identical with the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin isolated from the urine of the native patients .
with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not influence leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ized Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than in the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ poe@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results relate to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first dose or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of member states , the owner of the marketing agency has to provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the features of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging .
the owner of the authorisation for placing on the market has to ensure that the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 is set up and operational in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the drug is used in the traffic .
the owner of the authorisation for the placing on the market comm@@ its himself to the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the Pharmac@@ opo@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as specified in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. and according to each subsequent risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) , according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • When receiving new information , the impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or measures for risk reduction could have • within 60 days of reaching an important ( pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • after invitation by the E@@ MEA
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within a month prior to your treatment , if you suffer from unstable Ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis in veins ( deep vein thro@@ mb@@ oses ) .
they suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , arter@@ ies of legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you recently had a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it may occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood vessels , which re@@ forms again in subsequent treatment .
your doctor may also perform regular blood tests to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be considered and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed before the start of therapy .
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in case you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in is the risk of having problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or ascending potassium levels , your doctor may consider stopping the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a particular value .
according to the current findings , the treatment of blood poverty with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa administration and the desired effect should be considered to assess the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your red blood dy@@ es ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose to minimize the risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weighed very carefully over the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past there have already been thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ( e.g. deep vein thro@@ mb@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
in case you are cancer patients , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed may act as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances may neg@@ atively affect the tumor .
if a major orthop@@ edic surgery is in place , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly prior to the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines / or have recently taken / applied , even if it is a non @-@ prescription drug .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia ( an@@ a@@ emia ) responds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests in order to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may order regular blood tests if necessary , in order to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a specific value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia responds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to squ@@ ir@@ t Ab@@ se@@ amed himself underneath the skin .
heart , heart attacks , brain bleeding , stroke , temporary circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , blood cl@@ ots and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment .
ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ ck oils ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when applying ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it may occur - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed may be associated with increased risk of blood pro@@ pf@@ formation following surgery ( post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) , if your starting @-@ level value is too high

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently undergone a low traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture as in the case of a H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches in the three days following the in@@ fusion .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved in o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two trials to 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
main indicator for efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme , the bone substance is abol@@ ished ) in the blood once again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % against the bas@@ eline value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to those under placebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis therapies ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any other ingredient .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides medical information for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis , which contains indications of how to apply the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in whom the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued approval to Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the launch of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the European Union .

treating o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get disease with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently l@@ itt@@ led low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the initial ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of elderly patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , since data is missing for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as only limited clinical experiences exist for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia is to be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta before the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta by sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ oni@@ um ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene , should be weighed before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who require dental inc@@ isions , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to those receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 from 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which expressed itself as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as an acute ren@@ al failure .
changes in the cre@@ atine @-@ clearing ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were in a clinical trial for o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years compared to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis study in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently l@@ itt@@ led hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the area of the jaw was treated , especially in cancer patients , via o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ ing .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the area of the jaw in a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in case of over@@ dose , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia , a compensation of calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Sc@@ ore for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric ed@@ dy frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years and after one year the incidence of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a lasting effect over three years which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density at lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire th@@ igh by 6.0 % , the lower pel@@ vis by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the basin .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the trab@@ ecular bone volume and the retention of trab@@ ecular bone architecture compared to placebo .
bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - collagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly reduced by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment increased the BM@@ D at all points in total and lower frequency .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment performed more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment for an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in the overall balance and 4.3 % on the neck neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to reduce clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( Study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison with the once weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chens Ac@@ la@@ sta was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically approved , especially mild to moder@@ ately heavy @-@ weight mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value in case of inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
after 6 months of combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain influence was observed compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month trial ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be maintained in an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be a dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma tran@@ ce rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearing from the large cycle with half @-@ life cycles t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ ß β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long eli@@ oration phase with a terminal eli@@ min@@ ation period t ½ hr 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body clearance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearance of met@@ aboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ atine @-@ clearing , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing , and in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this means that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min requires no dose adaptation of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid .
because for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and at rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight .
studies on dogs were single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid was administered in rats by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and the intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections .
the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Metap@@ hysi@@ se of the long bones in animals during the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of reduced serum calcium levels .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

according to the CH@@ MP directive for risk management systems for human medicine products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted along with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known which could affect the current statements on safety , pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ isation ) was achieved . • On request of the E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the bone Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the case of the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is structured un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing bone reconstruction , providing normal bone formation , giving the bone its strength again .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines / or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to harm the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta in combination with food and drinks , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have enough fluids before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
the usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you recently broke the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip breast .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions closely so that the calcium level in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before completing the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering the completion of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next medical appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( at more than 30 % of patients ) , but after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions they are less frequent .
fever and shi@@ vers , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs because of too low calcium concentrations in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .
flu , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , fatigue , ting@@ ling / stu@@ ff@@ ing , drow@@ sin@@ ess , irrit@@ ation , stomach upset , stomach pain , hyper@@ tension , redness , it@@ ching , red@@ dening skin , swe@@ ating , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine , tissue shock and thirst .
persistent pain and / or cur@@ ative wounds in the mouth or j@@ aw@@ s were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates for other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed adverse effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application is used ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to carry the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be adequately supplied with fluids ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic ven@@ ge@@ tic , hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ oni@@ um .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ tures recently recommended a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D prior to in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond , one or more I
in addition , four studies were conducted in over 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting the smoking .
on the other hand , the studies on setting the smoking did not show consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this area of application .
which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants as it increases the risk of depression and among other things can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advised with simultaneous use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for HIV infection ) , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
medicines used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the ar@@ z
it Ad@@ ditional to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also include one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ emia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
La Depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
he also in patients who - besides the obesity - do not have any recognizable risks , can experience depres@@ sive reactions .
relatives or other close persons may indicate that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur . l@@ n
• El@@ der patients The effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently demonstrated .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies conducted in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) that cannot be adjusted satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ substance or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ substance or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ substance or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , which makes type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ substance , in addition they received Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced when using dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ substance showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional dose of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who also took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin decreased H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % to 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who also took placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ ology ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on cannot be used .
if the AL@@ T @-@ levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach discomfort , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be continued should be pres@@ ided by the clinical evaluation .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can ag@@ itate fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with liquid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent in patients with sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ substance and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ m@@ ite by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral two or three @-@ fold combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ substance or as two @-@ subject combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a was reported using thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a decrease in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescri@@ bing physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic diagnosis should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events in bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years for women treated with comparative medication .
in Pro@@ Active Study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2,5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or she enters , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not exercise relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ insulin @-@ induced hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother @-@ animal decreases and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .

these lead to a temporary change in the lens and refra@@ ction index of the lens , as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic active ingredients .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege on the three @-@ fold of the upper limit of the normal range also often appeared as below placebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ substance .
in an out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since its market launch , it has rarely been reported on cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency among Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more frequently if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
a summary analysis of adverse events in bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ active study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , followed by 180 mg / day more than seven days , no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator @-@ activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose degradation in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy was carried out over two years in order to investigate the time to leave the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the onset of therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin were random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical studies over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ atine quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ atine quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 week study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the total plas@@ matri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , while the values observed in met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the fun@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved post@@ den@@ di@@ ally increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active Study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups receiving either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations at imm@@ utable pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy is equivalent to the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours for humans , and the entire active metabol@@ ites lie at 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with impaired kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearing of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies appeared in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in the gest@@ ation dimin@@ ishes and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ ac@@ oli@@ d@@ Indi@@ ons resulted in increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ um tumours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years for women treated with comparative medication .
in Pro@@ Active Study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2,5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in a further study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were investigated .
in clinical studies over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ atine quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ atine quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only reduced the fun@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved post@@ den@@ di@@ ally increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels and the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d Syn@@ thesis .
although the study was aimed at its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the total mort@@ al , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary Rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cular@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not involve cardiovascular long @-@ term risks .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to effectively use insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were similarly reduced as with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package supplement ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weighed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission announced that Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S issued an approval for the launch of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example , by an intensive insulin therapy , can change hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change with regard to strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin of animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage required .
if a dose adaptation is necessary when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the doctor &apos;s advice , as such journeys can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and always ask his patients according to other medicines taken by them .

the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued an approval to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S agency for placing Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of rapidly acting insulin must be raised , then the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adaptation is necessary when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the doctor &apos;s advice , as such journeys can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 di@@ ab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic patients undergoing major surgical procedures has shown that an intraven@@ ous ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id induced nor@@ mo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % compared to 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration is approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ ab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to adults .
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0.@@ 05 I.@@ E. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ E. / ml insulin human in the in@@ fusion fluids 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D@@ - glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable at room temperature for 24 hours at room temperature .
11 If a dose adaptation is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosage or during the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to pick up the doctor &apos;s advice , as such journeys can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

this may happen : if you eat too much insulin , if you eat too little or leave a meal , if you are more than otherwise physically demanding
always set your Nov@@ o@@ Let &apos;s closing cap when it is not in use to protect it from light .
• Dis@@ inf@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on • Use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the injection needle straight and firm onto Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Figure A ) • Dra@@ g the large outer cap of the injection needle and remove the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow the steps below to avoid the injection of air and ensure proper dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • kno@@ ck up a few times with the finger against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , they will collect the cartridge at the top of the cartridge • Whi@@ le you continue to hold the injection needle upwards , rotate the cartridge by one click in the direction of the arrow ( Figure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues upward , squee@@ ze the push button ( Figure C ) • Now you have to leave a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle .
• Place the cap again in the production pen so that the digit is 0 opposite the metering mark ( Figure D ) • Control whether the push button is pressed completely .
when the push button cannot move freely , the insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The dial on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves out@@ wards while you rotate the cap • The dial below the push button ( push button ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Noti@@ fy the highest number you can see on the push button • add the two numbers to get the prescribed dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap simply for@@ wards or backwards until you have set the right number of units .
turn it until the push button is at the bottom and you feel a resistance , then take the cap off and set it up again so that the 0 of the metering brand is opposite .
make sure to press the push button only during injection • Ke@@ ep the push button after injection , until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
it may be in@@ accurate • You can not set a dose higher than the number of units remaining in cartridge • You can use the Rest@@ men@@ gen@@ sk@@ ala to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can &apos;t use them to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ uria is used in patients showing signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or pla@@ za ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger pri@@ ate @-@ crystalline deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two or four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients take other medicines for the prevention of rheum@@ atic attacks at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ uria ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared one year to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels were below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who received a dose of 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took 120 mg once a day , measured a urine acid test in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
particularly in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects that affect the heart and the blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ uria was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already resulted in pri@@ mor@@ dial deposits ( including a known or currently available g@@ out node and / or a g@@ out arthritis ) .
if the serum pole level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
in patients with severe kidney dysfunction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated so far ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ tation receivers , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ saw medicines , it is possible to get acute diar@@ rho@@ ea during the treatment , because the lowering of serum urine acid levels may initially be mobili@@ zed in tissue in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far increases that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the beginning of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was not carried out at F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ or can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( inhibit@@ ing the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
for subjects , the simultaneous dispens@@ ation of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x was associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously applied other active ingredient .
in a study involving subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily has an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of a ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decline in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant changes in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be excluded from the side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful in controlling a vehicle , operating machinery or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiac events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patients years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patients years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and the ( test results ) associated with the medicine could be reported and reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once are listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
in the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients ) , according to the indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :

AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum resin concentrations in patients , not@@ withstanding their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the Phase 3 open renewal study showed that the sustained reduction of serum res@@ ins to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require any treatment ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the die , which resulted in 54 % of patients with a complete disappearance of the no@@ des until month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant alteration in the percentage decrease in serum resin concentration was observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

these findings are seen as a result of specific Pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gy ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , spro@@ uted abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated belly ) as well as sour r@@ umping .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other constitu@@ ents AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be applied .
it must not be used in case of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission approved the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union to the Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following instructions are to be observed in order to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ations and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• After rising the day , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should not be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or break the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y can be given only under special care ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strokes , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some of them were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that point to possible adverse reactions and patients should be advised to relieve the drug during the occurrence of symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ o@@ sta@@ al heart@@ burn or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn of heart@@ burn and seek medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious adverse side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was observed , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and complications , were reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens were predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available that indicate whether the onset of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a max@@ illary surgical procedure reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw .
clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , they should take the tablet the next morning after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the intended day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the beginning of therapy .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was used in clinical studies together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurred .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate indicate no indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports are from cancer patients but also reported about o@@ steopor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , ab@@ uses of serum calcium up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar incidence occurred .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .

bio@@ availability rose accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in o@@ steopor@@ osis estu@@ aries , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies on rats showed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue following intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
elimination After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radio@@ actively marked substance were ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ eces .
following intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clear@@ ance did not over@@ shadow 200 ml / min .
in rats Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that in humans it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs through these transport systems .

characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the percentage of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bones , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although no clinical data are available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal testing will also be reduced in patients with impaired kidney function .
for this reason a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bones is expected in patients with impaired kidney function ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ ph will admini@@ ster adult patients whom a kidney or liver has been transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , using Adv@@ agra@@ ph with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after one year of treatment ( for example by examining how often a re @-@ transplan@@ tation or re @-@ absorption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , a shorter period of further studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were performed and evaluated how Adv@@ agra@@ ph is absorbed by the body in comparison with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other constitu@@ ents , Adv@@ agra@@ ph may not be used .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken at the same time with adv@@ agra@@ ph , as the Adv@@ agra@@ ph dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be appropriately adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of formulation or regime should be carried out only under the strict control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ ph should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case and on blood level measurements ( see below ) Recommen@@ dations
after the change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirrors should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after the change@@ over .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a level mirror , was comparable to both male and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ level mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the law can last several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral dosage in the first postoperative period , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application To supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection must be maintained immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustments can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advance therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph must be converted a transplan@@ t receiver of two daily doses of Pro@@ gra@@ f Cap@@ sul@@ es to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ph , so this conversion has to be done in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the entire daily dose .
after a mig@@ rations from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents to Adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ al@@ dose recommended in ren@@ al and liver transplan@@ tation must commen@@ ce for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In case of adult patients who are converted to adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day .
although there is no clinical experience with lawyers in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and intestinal transplan@@ t recipients resulted in a oral initiation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood @-@ age mirror in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum incre@@ mental level , a calculation of the cre@@ atine contents and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ ph With the switch from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in- to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the blood level in the whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ mirror controls .
it is recommended to perform common controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us &apos;s blood levels should also be checked after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , Dos@@ is@@ adaptation , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us thorou@@ gh@@ bred concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ agra@@ ph is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of seb@@ um in the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the progression of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts is usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml , and cardiac transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of formulation or regime should only be carried out under the strict control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has been proven to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m levels in the blood and weak@@ ening the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood is provided , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a cham@@ om@@ y@@ opathy called car@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ loading and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sives , exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin lesi@@ ons due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision should indicate a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
as Adv@@ agra@@ ph contains hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , lac@@ tose , in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption special care is required .
the simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels while keeping substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain consistent concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ biotic antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; hence , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduces the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives so that hormone exposure can increase , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly careful .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduces the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive drugs , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of new@@ bor@@ ns is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side @-@ effects profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant can often not be determined exactly because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ able .
mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are likely to be conveyed by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the accumulation of the connection in the cells .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ or of signal trans@@ duction in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a specific number of lymph@@ oma genes .
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymph@@ oma ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the large studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts .
L@@ ung@@ Crossing Plan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , there were 21.@@ 7 % of the cases of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ate syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
pancre@@ as transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients undergoing a random@@ ised tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) method .
the oral initiation dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired tal@@ low levels from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
intestinal transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after colon transplan@@ tations showed in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ zer@@ al transplan@@ tations ) under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rite and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the invol@@ un@@ tary fraction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed prior to ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion takes place mainly via the bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ ph was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in cases of stable patients ( once daily ) to Adv@@ agra@@ ph 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a deficiency caused by factor V@@ III , con@@ genital blood coag@@ ulation disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of V@@ III deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from a human plasma , but produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which em@@ powers it to the formation of the human coag@@ ulation factor V@@ III .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union , similar to Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was studied for the prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions .
in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of ble@@ ed@@ ings in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood vessels was awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor V@@ III .
advoc@@ ates may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human coag@@ ulation factor V@@ III , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the placing of Adv@@ ate in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor V@@ III deficiency , on the location and extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor V@@ III activity in the corresponding period is not to drop below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat inj@@ ections every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , adequate determination of the factor V@@ III plasma is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor V@@ III , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pre@@ vention for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. of factor V@@ III per kg of body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor V@@ III plasma activities cannot be achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor V@@ III therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be weighed .
the dosing speed is to be directed at the patient &apos;s discretion , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor V@@ III is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor V@@ III immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) pro ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor V@@ III , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is most important and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ cally known inhibit@@ or development , a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor V@@ III product has been observed on another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ ti@@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences concerning the use of factor V@@ III during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor V@@ III ( 5 patients ) , all of which had previously untreated patients , which have a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the total number of individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood coag@@ ulation factor V@@ III @-@ Spi@@ egels was performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma as well as the clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ V@@ III ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ V@@ III ≤ 2 % ) was determined by prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ V@@ III inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against Factor V@@ III .
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions as part of the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency unknown ) .
the activated factor V@@ III acts as a cache factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of the factor V@@ III activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the data available since the first approval , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits @-@ risk assessment as a positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s security profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , has decided that the regi@@ stran@@ t should apply for further renewal procedures in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited informed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company res@@ ig@@ ns its application for approval for the inj@@ un@@ ction of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans .
advoc@@ acy should have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to re@@ form the normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein again .
the p@@ 53 @-@ protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer appeared in the lower abdom@@ en area , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered .
based on the verification of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients .
the committee also concerns concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
moreover , the company did not sufficiently demonstrate that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not notice the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so compound that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is slowly released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and older , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ ung out .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed using a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active substances or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines for treating allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from con@@ strain glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary retention ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension caused by cereb@@ ral hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to transport Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms dimin@@ ish .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may reduce the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiva which are used per@@ or@@ ally or nas@@ al as a source of r@@ hin@@ ol@@ ine ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ but@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of the head@@ aches ) must be stopped .
treatment of the following patient groups is advised : • Pati@@ ents under digital@@ is • Pati@@ ents with heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder retention or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , however , experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ tor@@ ic properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to a di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible oral procedures .
headache , anxiety , sc@@ ary Mik@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , transp@@ ir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stimulation is especially likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , red@@ dening , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight rate including the ampli@@ fication of subjective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged 12 and 78 took part in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aero@@ bic tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aero@@ bic tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aero@@ bic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of dosing in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted using the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was noted that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bio@@ equivalent was the exposure after administration of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional safety pharmac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproduction toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any special dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

tell your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or are diagnosed when using Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • Hear@@ ts , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ aches , or strengthening of existing head@@ aches .
if you take an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is a non @-@ prescription drug .
the use in the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or decreases the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform you immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n it was very rare reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash .
about cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac hunting , stomach pain , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspic@@ uous liver values was also very rare reported .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 ml ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for insertion ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup and / or .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials on seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for insertion and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom score ( symptom score ) of 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the symptom scores were reduced after six weeks with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company SP Europe for the launch of A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , for allevi@@ ating symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience in clinical studies of efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms are terminated and resum@@ ed when re@@ occurring .
in the persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient may be recommended during the allergy period an ongoing treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
a clinical pharmac@@ ological study did not increase the performance of alcohol while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0,@@ 8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and with 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were administered .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight rate including the ampli@@ fication of subjective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can also be classified according to the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the onset of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
as shown by the overall score of the questionnaire regarding quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined as representative for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in different forms , irrespective of ae@@ ti@@ ology , and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited .
as hi@@ stam@@ ine is a caus@@ ative factor in all proph@@ etic diseases , it is expected that besides the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of quad@@ ric@@ eps at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines was excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study where patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional research on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproduction toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any special dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently from meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data available that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and find out more substance pollution ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is limited met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children that metabol@@ ise normally .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ som@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials using A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
a clinical pharmac@@ ological study did not increase the performance of alcohol while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group , similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 who came into question for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily allowance of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
at a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psych@@ omot@@ or impair@@ ment .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not increase or increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown by the overall score of the questionnaire regarding quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of quad@@ ric@@ eps at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are limited met@@ aboli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various individual dose studies , that AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ ung@@ bottles with child @-@ proof polypropylene closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at to intake once daily into the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be opened carefully and the dose of the ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate can be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials using A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were used .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight rate including the ampli@@ fication of subjective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

there is limited experience in clinical studies of effectiveness in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be opened carefully and the dose of the melt tablet must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine si@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for the capture formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

the spread of this poorly met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) greater than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( adult 2 % , children 3 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose Cros@@ sover studies by A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tabl@@ et@@ op using A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for the intake were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which is limited met@@ aboli@@ ze , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ som@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
infants between 6 and 23 months were the most frequently reported side effects reported more frequently than placebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution for taking no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years was observed .
the recommended doses were the concentrations of the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .

if you have forgotten taking A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablet if you forgot to take your dose in time , take it as soon as possible and then follow the normal treatment plan .
after the market launch of A@@ eri@@ us it was very rare to report cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulty breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , hi@@ ves ) and skin rash .
A@@ eri@@ us solution for boarding is indicated for children aged between 1 and 11 years , teenagers ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included .
if the solution is attached to an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for insertion with sc@@ aling , you can use them alternatively to take the appropriate quantity solution .
regarding the duration of treatment your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s under which you suffer and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking .
however , in children under 2 years diar@@ rhe@@ a , fever and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness were frequent side effects , while in adults fatigue , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness and head@@ aches were often reported as placebo .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for mounting is available in bottles with child @-@ proof closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml pack size is a measuring spoon or an application sy@@ ringe for preparation with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml cans .
Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company withdraw@@ s its application for approval for the launch of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic occurs when a new strain of the flu virus arises , which can easily be spread by humans to humans because humans have not yet established immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the part of the flu virus as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
this means that the immune system will later be able to make contact with a flu virus of this common type faster antibody .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as a foreign body ) , is cleaned up and used as part of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not investigated .
ap@@ eri@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out what anti@@ viral drugs the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood that the virus will respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines are taken .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ap@@ eri@@ ase depends on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gen@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS cannot heal , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ esters .
the drug A@@ gen@@ ase enhanced with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used earlier prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ence .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alteration of the viral load following treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo after 48 weeks , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase strengthened the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gen@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was able to increase viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who had further received their prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ence :
the most common side effects of ap@@ eri@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gen@@ ase may also not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or pharmaceuticals , which are degra@@ ded just as ap@@ eri@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ap@@ eri@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years were out@@ weighed over four years .
ap@@ eri@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of ap@@ eri@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for the use of ap@@ eri@@ ase in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ gen@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually ap@@ eri@@ ase capsules are given to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and patient pre@@ treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for ap@@ eri@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ stery ) , higher doses of ap@@ eri@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for ap@@ eri@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ather@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
ap@@ eri@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data on harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of ap@@ eri@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that ap@@ eri@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ap@@ eri@@ ase does not prevent the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ generic drugs should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal disease progression .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant medical information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly influenced by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of ap@@ eri@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
in patients who use these medicines at the same time , ap@@ eri@@ ase may be less effective because of decreased plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ at@@ ological symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be administered .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gen@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
ap@@ eri@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medications needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B . higher age , and associated with drug dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in H@@ äm@@ s@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ o@@ arthritis are present .
at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeutic width are not permitted at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ is@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width as@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines whose ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already receives St. John &apos;s wort , the amber mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increases , on the other hand , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , confirming the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment scheme .
52 % humili@@ ated when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved by the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study to use am@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the imagin@@ ative component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gen@@ ase lie at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ence would decrease .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised , as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ m@@ holes .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with ap@@ eri@@ ase , a reduction in dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2,@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value that after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was observed once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors , may cause interactions together with A@@ gen@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if used in combination with A@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ence it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da not be taken at the same time as ap@@ eri@@ ase since it can come to erectile dysfunction .
simultaneous use of anti @-@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma recept@@ ors of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
simultaneous use with ap@@ eri@@ ase can considerably increase its plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to test subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous dispens@@ ation of ap@@ eri@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids unless the possible benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in the plasma bars are expected at the same time as ap@@ eri@@ ase .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
a more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased at the same time of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while using A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am for 3 to 4 @-@ cases .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ at@@ ological symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given , such as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ or dose , if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants along with ap@@ eri@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as A@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the ni@@ st@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a decreased increase in 12 body weight in seed during lac@@ tation .
the further development of the descendants including fertility and reproductive ability was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
the side effects associated with the ap@@ eri@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to the termination of treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the use of ap@@ eri@@ ase or another drug used to treat HIV or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of ap@@ eri@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , and laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ al fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervical fat accumulation ( stit@@ ches ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated individuals who had been treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ches ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 2,@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s for a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ öser nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be broken off .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of ap@@ eri@@ ase twice daily along with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and incidence of side effects ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients who received ap@@ eri@@ ase along with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ protein prec@@ urs@@ ors with the result of a formation of invol@@ un@@ tary , non infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ mic Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ b@@ aked treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically tested .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

prototype analysis systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ence resistant isol@@ ates .
current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance on Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced likel@@ ihood of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ence resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance path@@ ways , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) appear .
vice versa , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ence @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a se@@ eding therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
evidence of the efficacy of am@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly combined with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with decreased virus sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis demonstrated the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to time @-@ adjusted A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ loss threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of untreated ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies ap@@ eri@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell numbers of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the mean duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % , on the other hand , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was imp@@ acted by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate must be administered with caution when given at the same time with ap@@ eri@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase Solution and A@@ generative capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regi@@ mens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous dosing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and therapeu@@ tical applications , there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
so far no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical studies , neither during administration of ap@@ eri@@ ase after the end of treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control and in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dose to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us jug@@ gling and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed which point to delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ stery ) , higher doses of ap@@ eri@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for ap@@ eri@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be treated with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
ap@@ eri@@ ase should be set in duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increases , on the other hand , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved by the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ence would decrease .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with ap@@ eri@@ ase , a reduction in dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ni@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ni@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ni@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ ni@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to test subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants along with ap@@ eri@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1,@@ 0 mg nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the ni@@ st@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in descendants during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ mic concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ence @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , treatment optimisation should be taken into consideration when using PI pre@@ treated children for the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; ap@@ eri@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate must be administered with caution when given at the same time with ap@@ eri@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ bili@@ ary aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for the human being is unclear .
however , there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control and in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that the metabol@@ isation path@@ ways are not fully mat@@ ured in young , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gen@@ ase Solution for intake is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefit of patients treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase Solution was neither covered in patients treated with PI nor treated with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution for intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for ap@@ eri@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
additionally , since there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of ap@@ eri@@ ase solution for insertion and low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adaptation for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gen@@ ase Solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a consequence of the high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that ap@@ eri@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ap@@ eri@@ ase does not prevent the risk 47 of a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
ap@@ eri@@ ase should be prolonged for a long time if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in H@@ äm@@ s@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ o@@ arthritis are present .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increases , on the other hand , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous use with ap@@ eri@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and result in related side effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected to significantly increase the plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake may not be used as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ col during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the ni@@ st@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 55 body weight in seed during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to the use of ap@@ eri@@ ase or another drug used to treat HIV or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ b@@ aked treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early departure of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

- If you have any further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . − This medicine was prescribed for you personally .
− When one of the listed adverse effects you have considerably impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to apply ap@@ eri@@ ase capsules along with low doses Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect of ap@@ eri@@ ase .
the use of ap@@ eri@@ ase will be based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment pre@@ history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above mentioned conditions or use any of the above drugs .
if your doctor has advised that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the effect ( boo@@ stery ) , make sure that you have carefully read the use information on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before the start of treatment .
there are also no sufficient information to recommend the use of ap@@ eri@@ ase capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for ampli@@ fication in children aged 4 to 12 years or generally in patients under 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For ing@@ es@@ tion of ap@@ eri@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you may need additional Factor V@@ III to control bleeding . − For patients receiving an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat can occur .
if you use certain medicines that may cause serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as ap@@ eri@@ ase , your doctor may perhaps perform additional blood tests to minimize possible security problems .
it is recommended that HIV @-@ positive women should not be able to breast@@ feed their children under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV .
no studies on the influence of ap@@ eri@@ ase on the air@@ worth@@ iness or the ability to operate machines were carried out .
please take this medicine after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from a intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
taking Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than one hour before or after ap@@ eri@@ ase , otherwise the effects of ap@@ eri@@ ase may be reduced .
dose of A@@ Gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
if your doctor decides that the intake of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will have to take higher doses ( 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
85 Dam@@ it A@@ gener@@ ase benefits as much as possible , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose prescribed by your doctor .
if you have taken a larger amount of ap@@ eri@@ ase than you should have taken if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of ap@@ eri@@ ase , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of slight bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is applied three times a week for a maximum of 16 weeks . • In case of acute ker@@ ato@@ sis , it is possible to apply three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment , with four weeks of pause between the treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected areas of the skin so that it leaves enough long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which the patients were treated for six weeks and performed Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies to a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ ini@@ es .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of sal@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a showed a complete healing rate of between 0 % and 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in over 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ trop@@ otic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ak@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ ini@@ es ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is continued until all visible war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesi@@ ons are completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream once he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and in the clean@@ sed , infected with cow@@ war@@ ts infected skin area until the cream is fully absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a stri@@ k@@ score leading to the circumc@@ ision .
in case of an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have also been observed under proper application , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied methods for the treatment of external fo@@ al war@@ ts in the genital and perio@@ don@@ tal region , no clinical experiences are available .
limited data points to an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group with regard to the elimination of the tilt war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line has not been studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or reactions form after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break of several days can be made .
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment are available , other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ fici@@ ally cell carcin@@ oma .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs do not have any clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tumours .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ ini@@ es on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or in the ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ id .
very limited data about the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ ini@@ es on anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p are available .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ op@@ last@@ y on the lower arms and hands does not support effectiveness in this application , so this application is not recommended .
local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 acute lesi@@ ons showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
because of the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , degeneration or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither after one @-@ off or after several topical use of quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly reported and prob@@ able or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in trials involving three times a week treatment were local reactions in the location of the treatment of the tilt war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include discomfort on the application site with an incidence of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trial reported side effects .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related to the side effect were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects indicated by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ op@@ last@@ y are listed below .
these clinical signs , according to the test plan , show that these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream often result in local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , Ex@@ k@@ ori@@ ation / Ab@@ leaves / Ab@@ sor@@ bs ( 23 % ) and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
this assessed according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream it was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe scar@@ f formation and sal@@ utation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ op@@ last@@ y , Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area .
the accidental unique oral recording of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically most serious side @-@ effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in regards to a complete healing of the cow@@ war@@ ts in i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior .
at 60 % of the patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od a total of 119 patients healed completely ; this was in 20 % of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne lesi@@ ons within a coherent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % for patients with clinical precip@@ itation after one or two treatment periods ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
the approved indications External F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ op@@ last@@ y and super@@ fici@@ ary bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore were not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials on children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages investigated ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively ) .
a minimal systemic inclusion of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ op@@ last@@ y was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest disease concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12@@ ,5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated obvious half @-@ life was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ op@@ last@@ y or super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study on the der@@ mal application carried out for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application .
the mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for humans due to systemic exposure is considered very low .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the drug @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ath@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neurological symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements more difficult , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients may need medication before administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study was mainly examined for the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effectiveness in the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years of age , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me decreased G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shi@@ vers .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review every year any new information that may be known and necessary to update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. approval for the introduction of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O m@@ am@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ath@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment where recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are usually formed , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience in the resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after an inter@@ ruption of treatment must be cau@@ tious due to the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity .
60 minutes prior to the onset of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ etic ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to breast milk from the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended that during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me not to breast@@ feed .
side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years are often found in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing stops and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug effects related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly heavy follow @-@ up and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , whereby the patient aged less than 5 years later came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( on average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ej@@ ection of the study ) 13 / 45 patients showed no antibodies detected by radio@@ activity ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients in whom there was never any ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with inf@@ low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was observed in the urine .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with incidence of undes@@ irable drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme therapy is one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enz@@ ym@@ atic activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the blood circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study covering the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for further 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the conduc@@ tivity shown in the following table .
the open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the total lung volume increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ ac@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease incidence between patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variable ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute hearing , movement of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with medium flow form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Sc@@ ore for this age group . the younger patients with the mean follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe version @-@ form only limited or no progress in cognitive development was to be determined .
in a phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schem@@ as were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent an acceptable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to those with older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional research on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any special dangers for humans .
since no tolerance studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except with the ones listed below 6.@@ 6 .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it is not stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C if the di@@ lution was done under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .

this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information to patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase that spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ kan@@ e ) , either in small amounts , or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction has occurred on Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs containing chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ ain because a possible risk of reduced effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me exists .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription medicines .
tips for handling - th@@ inning and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to the application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians or medical personnel ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes gradually to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditioned participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ s and facial oils .
very common ( appearance in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash • Joint diseases , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ ased pulse • hyper@@ tension • lower oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion station

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to easily spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ eme@@ tics &quot; ( pharmaceuticals against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given before or after the addition of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose is reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to split .
the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study on 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients with whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival times than with the comparison medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a 25 mg / ml solution .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose sis is taken from the penetration bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - , advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cancer , except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed administration and the day after the treatment .
during the seven days prior to the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first mixed dose as well as after each third movement cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood @-@ picture should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under the recovery of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood pattern or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o , or at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or older , an increased side effect risk was increased compared to patients aged 65 .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine @-@ clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - bor@@ der@@ value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the absence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times of the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with regard to bone immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al count has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number once again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ab@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was dis@@ regarded when a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed have to be instructed to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ y- la@@ k@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients during which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the out@@ flow before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment is to be weighed .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , if this drug was commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible pe@@ eling of the reproductive ability is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment order , advice regarding the sperm conservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can result in a reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion resulting in increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore caution is required if in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s are available with a long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed has to be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected in the pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy except if it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the start of treatment , advice regarding the blocking of sperm .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mixed into breast milk and unwanted effects of breast@@ feeding infants cannot be excluded .

it has been reported about cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were treated before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate which performs its effect by interrup@@ ting wi@@ ch@@ - and fol@@ c @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several approaches by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ at@@ reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ HAC@@ IS , a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , simply blind phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically important advantage of a survival compared to medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ months compared to those patients who were only treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving the test medication ( random@@ ised and treated ) in the treatment arm .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the single C@@ is@@ pla@@ in@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ center , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy treated patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ disk epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination versus gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1,@@ 15 ) for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = Con@@ fi@@ dence interval ; IT@@ T = Calcul@@ us @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total consecutive interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ discrimination limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

in addition , the patients needed the administration of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed by administration as mono@@ therapeu@@ tics were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ors in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ ones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in urine within 24 hours of application .

dissolve the contents of 500 mg / ml of sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preser@@ vatives , resulting in a conc@@ ration of approximately 25 mg / ml of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed .
the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low cal@@ orie , fat @-@ based diets .
patients who take All@@ i and do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , thereby causing a quarter of the fats that have been added with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
no relevant weight loss could be observed in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
the most common side @-@ effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s on anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stu@@ h@@ lab@@ gang , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ urge , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , departure o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( fan ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or in chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited approval for Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction in adults with overweight ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 body mass index ) and should be used in conjunction with a lightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fat @-@ based diet .
all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data on efficacy and safety .
because Or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and for patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • chol@@ est@@ ase • Pre@@ tation ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single @-@ meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with an improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a physician or pharmac@@ ist prior to treatment with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic must be adjusted if necessary .
patients who are all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on the interaction of drugs as well as in several cases with the simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
for the use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at up to 4 full years in clinical trials , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and the beta @-@ carot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin preparation before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
following the gift of a one @-@ time dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are linked to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the frequency of known side @-@ effects noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size .
it is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can cause anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ dose doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in majority of cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported after market launch , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a quick recovery of possible systemic effects caused by the lab@@ ori@@ ental properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect is used in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at taken three times a day in combination with hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fat @-@ based diets .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those participating in study , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their original weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2,8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average LD@@ L cholesterol was measured with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ alli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , not met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients , where the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ bi@@ ased dose was administered , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after cle@@ av@@ age of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ cine group ) , were identified , which represented nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproduction toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans .
pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system The owner of approval for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 , is described as described in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application and works before and while the product is available on the market .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
the most common side effects depend on the effect of the capsules and result in the fact that fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after the start of treatment , as at this time you have not yet consistently reduced fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize nutritional factors : • Start several days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ based diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you to exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly on your daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial night @-@ table , as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in whom these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • You may not use it after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the envelope . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • The container is tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow this in any case . • You can carry out your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is attached to this package .

overweight influences your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • High blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • O@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health .
choose meals which contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat permanently healthy .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you will also find as an indication of the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
what amount is appropriate for you is the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s mode of action , compliance with recommended fats is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while reducing the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects . • You should try to decrease gradually and continuously .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose approximately 0.5 kg per week without frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal every day , work in the garden or do other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you exercise 150 k@@ cal every day , i.e. by 3 km of walking , 30 to 45 minutes of gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a nutritional journal with information on the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program supporting weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed calories and fat du@@ cks and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in conjunction with a program tailored to your type , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , di@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years is not recommended as there is not enough information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient is binding a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong or moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate sa@@ vi@@ or for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued approval to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . it was approved by Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon , patients should be monitored closely with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advised with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi will not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not block the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics examined against tum@@ ors ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single IV dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of or@@ alen met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience on the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , therefore pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician .
clinical trials were the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least could be associated with alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of delivery ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequency of adverse events occurred as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ um ( half @-@ life 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) , which was given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received strong immun@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron on day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
following the findings of prec@@ lin@@ ical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
absorption After intraven@@ ous administration , an initial decrease of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentrate time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in doses and cancer patients .
following intraven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentrations was measured at 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days , the overall composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to that measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the disposable intake of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated via the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose were recovered within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered agent made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time IV injection injection , the total body @-@ body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale eli@@ oration period and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only according to ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use .
10 The prec@@ lin@@ ical studies revealed that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the period of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in approximately the 30@@ x of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the Medic@@ ines Agency for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicines &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) Hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damage the liver tissue , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are further increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon submitted data showing the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference physician to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns were expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed was not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical studies .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease resum@@ ed more patients than in reference to the reference drug ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine is immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ peti@@ go ( a skin infection accompanied by a crust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( cra@@ cking or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and wound wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been prov@@ ably or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ con may not have an effect on these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thus inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy in all five studies was the proportion of patients whose infection was cl@@ ung to the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar rates of response : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin findings , about 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections out@@ weigh the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission informed the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the launch of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation due to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will begin .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary infected open wounds , the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of the simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been reached in people after topical application on s@@ wollen skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sk@@ ul@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients , dosage adjustments are not required if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in terms of a statement about the effect on birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether the breast@@ feeding should be continued / completed or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / completed is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections used by Al@@ tar@@ go , the most frequently reported side effect of irrit@@ ation at the place of delivery , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding points of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the transfer of pep@@ tide , partly blocking P @-@ binding inter@@ actions , preventing the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some infection forms appears question@@ able , advice should be pursued by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of a non @-@ response to the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and sk@@ ul@@ led skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 with the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic involvement in people after topical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of s@@ wollen skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver microphones was primarily conveyed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with less involvement of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rats @-@ micro@@ nucleus test for the in @-@ vi@@ vo study of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which resulted in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of scrat@@ ched skin ) :

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses can be ended .
if a ref@@ res@@ ing dose against hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines act as they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine approved since 1996 , and the approved vaccine of Twin@@ rix since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as proof for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children , who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix led between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active agents , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standardization plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses of vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a boo@@ ster is required for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) and anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to a hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination need a boo@@ ster vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in case of no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the use of the vaccine .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ virus and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels , so that the dose of additional doses may be required in these cases .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ utation , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in the case of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood coag@@ ulation , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as an exception , as it may occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ us and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and skill on a calculation basis per V@@ acc@@ ine Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of am@@ ic@@ ity was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. about the total vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and ang@@ ulation was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed in combination with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a common incidence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination @-@ vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years , ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the dose of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
both studies received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were at the time of pri@@ ming between 12 and 15 years , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study was comparable to that obtained after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year was administered simultaneously with the creation of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults demonstrated the current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ en@@ sion for any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , state charge sharing is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transferred by other means , such as water contaminated by sewage .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 cans .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before the intake of both V@@ ines Ambi@@ rix ( although you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of your vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after a Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection cannot be conveyed .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may occur due to it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath , or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child have a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a hepatitis B protection ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / her child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B V@@ acc@@ ine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface coating ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected by persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / is or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is .
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child are taking other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated recently / has been given or has been planned or has been planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as many lim@@ b as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently needed that they will be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very frequently ( more than 1 case per 10 prescribed doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort at the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ iness • irrit@@ ability • headache • loss of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 disti@@ lled doses ) : • swelling at the injection place • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal complaints
other side effects reported in days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 missed doses ) are :

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without pins and in packs of 50 without pins .
based on the data that have become known since obtaining the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP has the opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited because of low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ es@@ eed can also be used in patients aged over one month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia mic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ium is - divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or via a gastro@@ pod ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study since am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a fake medication , that is , without active ingredient ) .
am@@ mon@@ es@@ eed may also cause loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , fluid retention , taste problems , or taste , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ium in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
am@@ mon@@ es@@ eed was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this drug was available .
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ fests itself after the first life @-@ month ) , there is an indication of use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency have to receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and dem@@ dem@@ formation .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate takes place via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and decreased number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS 56 % of patients had at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dosing occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms involve the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity at intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ aboli@@ cal active compound which con@@ ju@@ gates with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
top@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ro@@ genous atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment will start immediately to improve survival chances and clinical results .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life .
through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative methods of nit@@ ric ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated by hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
existing neurological defic@@ its are also hardly rever@@ sible during treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is known to be oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were determined 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing .
according to different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma was det@@ ectable in the next morning after a different dose of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma pass were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion This medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ pod or a nose probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly trans@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rats were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) prior to the birth , lesi@@ ons in the pyr@@ amid@@ al cells of the brain cor@@ tex occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ect@@ al patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
top@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ro@@ genous atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion surplus
based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it is possible to assume that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
existing neurological defic@@ its are also hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ular form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were determined 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ing .
during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is a non @-@ prescription drug .
during breast@@ feeding , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , reduction of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disturbances and worsen@@ ing of existing neurological conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or your hospital &apos;s emergency room for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood balance ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin odor , rash , kidney dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the cart@@ on and the container after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use@@ able until &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS and the content of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the em@@ bos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is a non @-@ prescription drug .
they should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS into the same single doses or@@ ally or via a ga@@ stri@@ c ( hose , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose , which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ ap@@ ed measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate out of the container . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the spoon to remove excess gran@@ ules . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon corresponds to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons of gran@@ ulate out of the container .
angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stroke &quot; ( an abnormal measured value of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) using conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ an ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , the patient often was a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without gift of GP@@ I - in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as the conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , Angi@@ ox was as effective in terms of all indicators as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued approval to the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the inj@@ un@@ ction of angi@@ op@@ last@@ y across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ stroke inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a IV mg / kg intraven@@ ous bol@@ us followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient subsequently performs a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours following clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure , an injection of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a directly subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single injection of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and administered intraven@@ ously at intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second half dose should be checked again .
in patients with severe kidney damage , included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) included for approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after giving the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • Active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disorder of the hem@@ o@@ st@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible coag@@ ulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when a bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of the arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can occur in principle everywhere bleeding .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with a bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is once again achieved prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly checked .
animal experimental studies are inadequate in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , degeneration or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or en@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more frequent in women and for patients over 65 years of experience than in male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ Dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ at@@ oma or bleeding in the points area , which required radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding center , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information about side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more frequent in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organ@@ classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with a bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ine is immediately removed and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and on the ani@@ on binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , a bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ine with serum from patients , in which it had occurred in the past to he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was carried out following a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent an angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on four triple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in Table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ot@@ ox@@ in in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine as pep@@ tide passes a cat@@ abol@@ ism into its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ valuation of amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabol@@ ite resulting from the cle@@ av@@ age of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children aged six and over with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or upper arm or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or can not process insulin effectively .
insulin ul@@ is@@ in is very slightly different from Human@@ insulin , and the change means that it acts more quickly and has a shorter active duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and sevent@@ een years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot be processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for efficacy was the alteration of the concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin doses .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or delta or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal cavity .
due to reduced glucose @-@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin demand in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced .
any change of the active force , the brand ( manufacturers ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin demand .
3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ related diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the switch from one patient to another insulin type or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of the dosage required .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active ingredient of the insulin used and can therefore change when mig@@ rating the treatment scheme .
they include oral anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ates , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic , sal@@ am@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
additionally , under the effects of sympath@@ iz@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , cl@@ oni@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ ine and reserve the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or absent .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin is transferred into human breast milk , but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed to oral application .
listed below are the undes@@ irable medications known from clinical studies grouped according to system organ@@ classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

eyel@@ pod@@ yst@@ rophi@@ es ed@@ ged to continuously change the injection point within the injection unit , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous glu@@ co@@ sis by a doctor .
after glu@@ col@@ ine injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to detect the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the action occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ tic effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more an under@@ proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ising effect , just like Human@@ insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ in has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ tic effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ den@@ pran@@ ic gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before meal .
was insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ den@@ pran@@ ic control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is applied in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control as with human normal insulin , which is given two gro@@ o@@ ves prior to meal ( see Figure 1 ) , is reached .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at a dose of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at a dose of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
