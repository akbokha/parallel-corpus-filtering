<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has evaluated the studies conducted in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your disease or treatment, please read the package supplement (also included in the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablet tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. turbulent thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disruption, a mental disorder where patients have alternate episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and prophylactic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased restlessness or behavioral disorders if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for inhaling or the melting tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are broken down just as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the transmission of signals between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably acts primarily as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less measure than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting from increased restlessness over a period of two hours with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared over 12 weeks to 347 patients with Haloperdol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder resulting from increased disturbance associated with lauazepam (another antipsychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to the treatment was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melt tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg had a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased disturbance than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify reduced in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for recurrence of manic episodes in previously untreated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (nausea), nausea, nausea, nausea, vomiting, nausea, vomiting, nausea, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes spoke to the treatment with Aripiprazole were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in quick monitoring of increased disturbance and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the placing of Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes spoke to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a daily maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">A lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The incidence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after changing an anti-psychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicidal with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used cautiously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acceleriated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia appearing during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia treated with Abilify, consider reducing the dose or stopping the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mn, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotika, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease had patients who were treated with Aripiprazole an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated patients who permit direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with regards to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency because of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required if Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting drugs with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should be outweighed by the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseininhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar doses.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Because of the insufficient data situation for the safety of humans and concerns caused by the animal reproductive studies, this drug may not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against using dangerous machines, including vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative effect on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of over 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiprazole showed a generally lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and dyskinesia compared to patients treated with Haloperdol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment was 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients with Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled trial of over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients with Aripiprazol- Treatment and 53.3% in patients with Haloperdol treatment was.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treated.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- Treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of the CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events associated with an anti-psychotic therapy and their incidence in treatment with Aripiprazol include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are no information on the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in the treatment of overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazol has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of binding of 11C Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at the nucleus caudatus and on the putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperdol-controlled study, 52% of responder patients who had a response to the study were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperdol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg- depression rates, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperdol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal 'weight gain' was, significantly fewer patients gain a gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dose over 3 weeks involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazol showed a superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of Lithium or Haloperdol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 Aripiprazol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania such as lithium or haloperdol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in some over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients receiving a remission during a stabilisation phase, Aripiprazol showed superiority in the prevention of a bipolar response, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylization of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyulation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol for extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as did not show any gender-dependent effects in a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenic patients.</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific analysis of pharmacokinetic showed no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) did not show a significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional research on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so that they have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects include a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10x of the mean steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of Aripiprazol in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81fold of the recommended maximum dose for humans (based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human Gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydroxy- Aripiprazole contain no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages that led to exposure of 3 and 11 times of the mean steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution in patients with agility and behavioral disorders that were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazol injection solution as necessary, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">The safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution is not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazol should be used cautiously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acceleriated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia appearing during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of mns are high fever, muscle stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>

<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar deficiency because of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the Sedation was larger compared to that after every dose of Aripiprazol, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazol (15 mg dose) were intramuscularly used as one-time indication and simultaneously received the Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites, compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites can result in common use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseininhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar doses.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>

<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioral disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant stronger improvement in the symptoms of agility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from baseline value on PANSS Excitement Component score was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed with regard to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a Haloperdol-controlled study, 52% of responder patients who had a response to the study were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77%) and Haloperdol 73%.</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and Montgomery Asberg depression rates, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperdol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>

<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in some over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week extension of study in some patients receiving a remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation phase before randomization, Aripiprazol was superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazol AUC is 90% bigger the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time to achieve the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure (AUC), which was intramuscularly about the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity following intravenous application, there were no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbit) about the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) for safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data could not detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; hence, they have limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Furthermore, cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of Aripiprazole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81-times of the recommended maximum dose for humans (based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study on which 460 women with metastatic breast cancer participated, of which about three quarters had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects) was compared with a drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines.</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Considering only those patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel drugs.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel and that, unlike other paclitaxel drugs, it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued approval to the Abraxane Company of Abraxane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma in patients with first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anthracycline containing therapy (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or serious sensorial neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensoric neuropathy grade 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached on degrees 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see Section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">There were no studies with patients with impaired kidney function and there are currently no adequate data on recommending dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanopartikelformulation of paclitaxel, which could have substantially other pharmacological features than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">No new Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated, until the neutrophils rise again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocytes rise again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a cardiotoxicity associated with Abraxane is not proven, cardiac abnormalities in the indicated patient group are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If there are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in the patient after the gift of Abraxane, these can be treated with the usual antiemetics and constiptive methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, except the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraception during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to give no child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm conservation, as the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects like fatigue (very common) and dizziness (often) which can affect the traffic and the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most striking important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the use of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagy, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, painful gums, loose stools, oessophagitis, sores in the mouth, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of the muscles, pain in the body, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, back pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive example in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is a microtubules substance that promotes the aggregation of the microtubules from tubular indims and stabilises the microtubules by blocking its depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital intervention and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in in-vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumin receptor and due to the albumin protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast carcinoma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-armed unobstructed studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III study study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for over 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of a solvent-containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or as 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastases and 19% because of metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for abring on baseline based on the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 courses of treatment was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active substance exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multi-phase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with an intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) following the Abraxane administration (43%) compared to a solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher in Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized with 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative ureexcretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected from light light for 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be observed when dealing with Abraxane caution.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, sodium chloride infusion solution is injected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the water flow bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the water-through bottle should be swiveled slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until complete resuspension of the powder is done.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitation or sminkers are visible, the water-through bottle must be inverted gently to achieve a complete resuspension prior to the application.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the features of the medicine (specialist information), labelling and packaging. • With a clear imaging of the correct application of the product, cooling boxes provided for transport by the patient.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference medicines").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels that could occur in connection with blood transfusion complications, if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make a blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his caregiver, provided they have received an appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietine deficiency or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used against operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with the reference medicinal product when administered as an injection in a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before they were either transferred to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of abseamed under the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were switched to Abseamed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Seamed may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as injections under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed the European Union has demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that makes Abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted Medice Medicinal Pütter GmbH & Co KG approval for the launch of Abseamed in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiplem myeloma, which receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (such as cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in planned major surgical procedures that require a large volume of blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a large electro-orthopaedic operation in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients in which the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can be observed over or below the hemoglobin target concentration in one patient.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dosage can be reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest licensed dose, which is required for the control of anaemia and the symptoms of anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia less difficult (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest licensed dose required to control the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment of the hemoglobin value increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl over the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increased &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the number of readings of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the baseline value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week, the hemoglobin value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the number of readings of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the number of reticulocytes around &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, a response to the epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood conserration is required, Abseamed should receive 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once weekly over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg on 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from erythropopoetin at erythroblastomenie (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive any Abseamed or other erythropopoetin (see section 4.4 - Erythroblastomenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thromboses (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients who are not able to participate in an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, vascular disease of the carotian or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recently entered heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomenie (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti-body mediated PRCA after monate- to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effect, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the measured value should be determined and the common causes for a non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium toxicity, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the Retikulocytes "Index"), is low (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20.000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), which is found to be found in thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers, and if no other cause of a loss of effect is found, the anti-erythropocyte antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow for the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of an anti-body-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating active substances (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit due to the addition of epoeines if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestion insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 is not to be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the current findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In patients with chemotherapy, epoetin alfa should be taken into account for a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropopoetin response (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anaemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">If possible, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly, if possible, before the beginning of the epoetin alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thromboseprophylaxis since they have increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events is possible for patients with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy if haemoglobin target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporine dose should be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumour tissue, there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, cerebral thromboses, vascular thromboses, pulmonary thromboses, arterial thromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys has been reported in patients under Erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetines.</seg>

<seg id="576">Main indicator for efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme, the bone substance is abolished) in the blood once again normalized or decreased by at least 75% against the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis therapies) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to those under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis therapies), the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates or any other ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion site and osteonecrose (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides medical information for doctors who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains indications of how to apply the medicine, as well as a similar material for patients in whom the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued approval to Novartis Europharm Limited for the launch of Aclasta in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • The package supplement • Concontraindications in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing help</seg>
<seg id="588">Treating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">Intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Paget disease with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable for patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient intake of calcium, corresponding to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently littled low-traumatic hip fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.E. oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the initial aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of elderly patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, since data is missing for harmlessness and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), as only limited clinical experiences exist for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalcemia is to be treated with Aclasta before the treatment with Aclasta by sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of Zoledronic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalcemia can develop whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of acetonium (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable for patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient intake of calcium, corresponding to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, should be weighed before applying bisphosphonates a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental incisions, no data is available whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">Cases of atrial fibrillation in patients who received Aclasta increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to those receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 from 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney dysfunction Zoledronic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction, which expressed itself as a decrease in kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatine) and in rare cases as an acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">Changes in the creatine-clearing (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited renal function were in a clinical trial for osteoporosis over three years compared to the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium values that were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2,10 mmol / l) were 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently littled hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the infusion site such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the area of the jaw was treated, especially in cancer patients, via osteonekrosis (primary in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates including zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervening.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study with 7,736 patients showed osteonecrose in the area of the jaw in a patient treated with Aclasta and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdose, which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalcemia, a compensation of calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) -T-Score for the Schenkelhals ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric eddy fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years and after one year the incidence of one or more new spinal fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a lasting effect over three years which resulted in reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density at lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all time points (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire thigh by 6.0%, the lower pelvis by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the basin.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the retention of trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-Telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta significantly reduced by 30% compared to baseline value and was held at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. ally or intramuscularly) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Overall mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclasta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment increased the BMD at all points in total and lower frequency.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment performed more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment for an increase in BMD by 5.4% in the overall balance and 4.3% on the neck neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to reduce clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (Study CZOL446M2308), the annual administration of Aclasta in comparison with the once weekly administration of Alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget des Knochens Aclasta was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically approved, especially mild to moderately heavy-weight morbus Paget of the bone (medium serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to 2.6x to 3.0x age-specific upper normal value in case of inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of risedronate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">After 6 months of combined results, a similar decrease in pain and pain influence was observed compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six-month trial (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and 107 patients treated with risedronate patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with Risedronate could be maintained in an average duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledron acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be a dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma trance rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearing from the large cycle with half-life cycles t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ ß β 1.87 hours followed by a long elioration phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ hr 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of metabolized substances by cytochromium P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearing of zoledron acid correlated with the creatine-clearing, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin-clearing, and in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This means that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney dysfunction down to a creatinin-clearing up to 35 ml / min requires no dose adaptation of zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because for severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letally acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and at rats 0,6 mg / kg of body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">Studies on dogs were single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was administered in rats by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose equivalent to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, and the intravenous injections.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the Metaphysise of the long bones in animals during the growth phase with almost all dosages, an infection that reflects the pharmacological, antiresorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed on rabbits, although the maternal toxicity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of reduced serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a representative of a substance class called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the bone Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens formed from androgens play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the case of the morbus Paget the bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is structured unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing bone reconstruction, providing normal bone formation, giving the bone its strength again.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you will be treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you are taking other medicines / or have recently taken / applied, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to harm the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="686">Before completing the treatment with Aclasta If you are considering the completion of the treatment with Aclasta, please take your next medical appointment and discuss it with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion are very common (at more than 30% of patients), but after the subsequent infusions they are less frequent.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and shivers, muscle or joint pain and headaches occur within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has evaluated the studies conducted in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (particularly overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients) that cannot be adjusted satisfactorily with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl harnsubstance or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyl harnsubstance or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of sulfonyl harnsubstance or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, which makes type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the effectiveness of Actos in tripletherapy was examined; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl harnsubstance, in addition they received Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, suggesting that blood sugar levels were reduced when using dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl harnsubstance showed a decrease in HbA1c values by 0.94% while the additional dose of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients who also took Actos in addition to insulin decreased HbA1c values from 0.69% to 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who also took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypothesiology (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for placing Actos in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other hand the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the use of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon cannot be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to hepatic dysfunction such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper stomach discomfort, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon should be continued should be presided by the clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can agitate fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with liquid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under therapy with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lesser extent in patients with sulfonyl harnsubstance and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and haematocrimite by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive Pioglitazon as oral two or three-fold combination therapy with a sulfonyl harnsubstance or as two-subject combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a diabetic macular edema was reported using thiacolidindions, including Pioglitazon, a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribing physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic diagnosis should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events in bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patients years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patients years for women treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In ProActive Study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patients years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2,5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or she enters, the treatment is deprecated (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not exercise relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochromium P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazon the hyperinsulin-induced hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother-animal decreases and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from this data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the lens and refraction index of the lens, as seen in other hypoglycemic active ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon, ALT-Anstiege on the three-fold of the upper limit of the normal range also often appeared as below placebo, but less frequently than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl harnsubstance.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its market launch, it has rarely been reported on cardiac insufficiency among Pioglitazon, but more frequently if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events in bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the Proactive study over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, followed by 180 mg / day more than seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose degradation in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclacide as monotherapy was carried out over two years in order to investigate the time to leave the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the onset of therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial of over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin were randomized to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatine quotients showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatine quotients compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18 week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as slightly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced the total plasmatriglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels was observed under Pioglitazon, while the values observed in metformin and Gliclacide were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the funglycerides but also improved postdendially increased triglyceride levels, both on triglyceride levels and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive Study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups receiving either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations at immutable pioglitazone in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to efficacy is equivalent to the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochromium P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochromium P450 2C8-inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the wood (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination period of unaltered Pioglitazon is 5-6 hours for humans, and the entire active metabolites lie at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with impaired kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearing of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies appeared in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazon, the hyperinsulinemia resulting in the gestation diminishes and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiacolidIndions resulted in increased frequency of colontum tumours.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patients years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patients years for women treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In ProActive Study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patients years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2,5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study of two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazon or Gliclacide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatine quotients showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatine quotients compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the funglycerides but also improved postdendially increased triglyceride levels, both on the triglyceride levels and the hepatic Tryglizerid Synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was aimed at its primary endpoint, which presented a combination of the total mortal, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that the intake of pioglitazone does not involve cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly, for example, by an intensive insulin therapy, can change hypoglycemia symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change with regard to strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (through recombinant DNA towards insulin of animal origin) may cause a change in the dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adaptation is necessary when switching to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions after a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling across multiple time zones, the patient should be advised to pick up the doctor's advice, as such journeys can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and always ask his patients according to other medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycaemia that can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetestherapy increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures, causing temporary or permanent disruption of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system Occasional - Peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are called acute painful neuropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 An intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement of blood sugar adjustment can, however, be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Skin and skin tissue diseases Occasional - Lipodystrophies At the injection point a lipodystrophy can occur if failed to change the insertion points within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">Public hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma at the injection point) may occur during insulin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Occasional - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angionic oedema, breathing problems, palpitations, low blood pressure, and impotence / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia can, however, develop gradually: • Easy hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugars, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemia with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a single-weight auxiliary person or by glucose which is intravenously given by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of fissures (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on the conventional research on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any special dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actraphane bottle is removed from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin should be increased to room temperature (not exceeding 25 ° C) before it is resuspended according to the operating instructions for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions after a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="895">12 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycaemia that can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetestherapy increase the risk of abnormalities and fruit tod in utero.</seg>
<seg id="896">13. however, an intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement of blood sugar can be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="897">The terminale half-life time (t ½) is therefore rather a measure of resorption as a measure of the elimination per se of the insulin from the plasma (insulin has a t ½ of just a few minutes in the bloodstream).</seg>

<seg id="1021">Before each injection • Check if at least 12 units of insulin are left in the cartridge to ensure an even mix.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Follow the steps below to avoid the injection of air and ensure proper dosage: • Keep Actraphane 10 NovoLet with the injection needle upwards • knock up a few times with the finger against the cartridge.</seg>
<seg id="1023">If air bubbles are present, they will collect the cartridge at the top of the cartridge • While you continue to hold Actraphane 10 NovoLet with the injection needle upwards, press the button in the direction of the arrow (Figure D) • While you continue the injection needle gently in (Figure D) • Now you have to leave a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle.</seg>
<seg id="1024">• Place the cap again in the production pen so that the digit is 0 opposite the metering mark (Figure E) • Control whether the push button is pressed completely.</seg>
<seg id="1025">If not, turn the cap until the push button is pressed completely • Keep your Actraphane 10 NovoLet horizontally.</seg>
<seg id="1026">If the push button cannot move freely to the outside, the insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The dial on the cap shows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 units.</seg>
<seg id="1027">The push button moves outwards while you rotate the cap • The dial below the push button shows 20, 40 and 60 units.</seg>
<seg id="1028">Check a set dosage • Notify the number on the closing cap next to the dosage stamp • add the highest number you can see on the pressure button • add the two numbers to get the prescribed dose • If you have set a wrong dose, turn the cap simply forwards or backwards until you have set the right number of units.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Otherwise, insulin is discharged from the injection needle and the prescribed dose will not be correct • If you have mistakenly tried to set up a dose of more than 78 units, follow the following steps:</seg>
<seg id="1030">Then remove the cap and set it up again so that the 0 of the metering brand is opposite.</seg>
<seg id="1031">Make sure to press the push button only during the injection process. • Keep the push button after injection, until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver disease During phase 3 clinical trials, slight abnormalities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the beginning of the Febuxostat (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline was not carried out at Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO-inhibitor can lead to an increase in theophylline (inhibiting the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">For subjects, the simultaneous dispensation of Febuxostat and naproxen 250 mg 2 x was associated with an increase in Febuxostat Exposure (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase of adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without requiring a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or the simultaneously applied other active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving subjects 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily has an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, which indicates a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antacids It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of a antacids containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delayed the absorption of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a decline in CMAx by 32%, but no significant changes in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregnancies can not be excluded from the side effects of Febuxostat on the pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>

<seg id="1204">The related events reported during the long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 studies (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported more than once in all Febuxostats and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patients), according to the indications occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in pivotal studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency:</seg>

<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage of serum resin concentrations in patients, notwithstanding their kidney function (58% in group with normal kidney function and 55% in group with severe kidney dysfunction).</seg>
<seg id="1221">The primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX- and FACT study) had a serum resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from the Phase 3 open renewal study showed that the sustained reduction of serum resins to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) showed a decrease in the incidence of gout seizures (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not require any treatment).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the die, which resulted in 54% of patients with a complete disappearance of the nodes until month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving allopurinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) increased from Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the CMAx amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant alteration in the percentage decrease in serum resin concentration was observed if this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to prove the effectiveness of ADROVANCE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) compared to those who only received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the Alendrone dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), constipation, dysphagy (swallowing disorders), sprouted abdomen (bloated belly) as well as sour rumping.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other constituents ADROVANCE must not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It must not be used in case of oesophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following instructions are to be observed in order to reduce the risk of esophageal irritations and related side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• After rising the day, ADROVANCE should not be swallowed with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • The patients should not chew the tablet or break the tablet in the mouth, as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract except pyloroplasty can be given only under special care (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions such as ophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal strokes, were reported in patients under the intake of alendronate (some of them were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that point to possible adverse reactions and patients should be advised to relieve the drug during the occurrence of symptoms of ophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retroostaal heartburn or new or worsening heartburn of heartburn and seek medical advice (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious adverse side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with Alendronat no increased risk was observed, gastric and duodenal ulcera, among them some severe and complications, were reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonecsis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimens were predominantly intravenously administered bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available that indicate whether the onset of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who need a maxillary surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteonecsis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that when taking a dose of ADROVANCE, they should take the tablet the next morning after they have noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned for the intended day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated with ADROVANCE before the beginning of therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, Alendronat was used in clinical studies together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clinically relevant interactions occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with Alendronate indicate no indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteonecsis of the jaw was reported in patients under bisphosphonates; most reports are from cancer patients but also reported about osteoporosis patients.</seg>

<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, using Advagraph with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after one year of treatment (for example by examining how often a re-transplantation or re-absorption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, a shorter period of further studies on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation were performed and evaluated how Advagraph is absorbed by the body in comparison with Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this drug or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes of formulation or regime should be carried out only under the strict control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of a switch to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraph should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in the individual case and on blood level measurements (see below) Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After the changeover from Prograf to Advagraph, the Tacrolimus-Talmirrors should be checked before the changeover and over two weeks after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a level mirror, was comparable to both male and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the tacrolimus-level mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraph to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, an adaptation of the law can last several days before the Steady State is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the patient's condition does not allow oral dosage in the first postoperative period, the tacrolimus treatment can be initiated intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an infusion solution) with a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of the application To suppress graft rejection must be maintained immunosuppression; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advance therapy should start at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustments can be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advance therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraph must be converted a transplant receiver of two daily doses of Prograf Capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraph, so this conversion has to be done in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), based on the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After a migrations from other immunosuppressive agents to Advagraph once a day, the treatment with the oral initialdose recommended in renal and liver transplantation must commence for the prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In case of adult patients who are converted to advagraph, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Although there is no clinical experience with lawyers in lung, pancreatic and colorectal transplanted patients, a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and intestinal transplant recipients resulted in a oral initiation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood-age mirror in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunctions a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum incremental level, a calculation of the creatine contents and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporin to Advagraph With the switch from a Ciclosporin- to a tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the blood level in the whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of thoroughbred tacrolimus-talmirror controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common controls of the tacrolimus valley level during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Tacrolimus's blood levels should also be checked after conversion from Prograf to Advagraph, Dosisadaptation, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or while using substances that could change the Tacrolimus thoroughbred concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advagraph is a medicine with a low clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of sebum in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the progression of tacrolimus in whole blood in the first time after liver transplants is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml, and cardiac transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur as a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes of formulation or regime should only be carried out under the strict control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which has been proven to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retardized formulation Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplants and transplant recipients in childhood, there are no clinical data for the retardized formulation Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions, which can lead to a reduction of the tacrolim levels in the blood and weakening the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies during treatment with Advagraph (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations in the blood is provided, since the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf a chamomyopathy called cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore also occur under Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid overloading and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressives, exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of maligner skin lesions due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and blurred vision should indicate a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">As Advagraph contains hard capsules, retardized, lactose, in patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose-malabsorption special care is required.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while keeping substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain consistent concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, istraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macrobiotic antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; hence, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can interfere with their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus reduces the clearance of steroid contraceptives so that hormone exposure can increase, decisions on contraceptive measures should be particularly careful.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus potentially reduces the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients do not indicate that under Tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressive drugs, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of newborns is recommended for possible adverse effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a deficiency caused by factor VIII, congenital blood coagulation disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether Advate is used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from a human plasma, but produced according to a method called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which empowers it to the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union, similar to Recombinate, but is made differently, so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was studied for the prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the efficacy of Advate in the prevention of bleedings in 86% of 510 new blood vessels was awarded with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>

<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period is not to drop below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.U. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat injections every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, adequate determination of the factor VIII plasma is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prevention for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.E. of factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities cannot be achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosing speed is to be directed at the patient's discretion, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatory activity of Factor VIII immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) pro ml plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of inhibiting inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is most important and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first approval, CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits-risk assessment as a positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP on the basis of ADVATE's security profile, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, has decided that the registrant should apply for further renewal procedures in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited informed the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the Company resigns its application for approval for the injunction of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is an "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advocacy should have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to reform the normal p53-protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53-protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li-Fraumeni cancer appeared in the lower abdomen area, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the company's answers to the questions he asked, there were still some questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the verification of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also concerns concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company did not sufficiently demonstrate that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not notice the CHMP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are so compound that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other is slowly released over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and older, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clung out.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed using a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except constipation of the nose, patients who received aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients with Aerinaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (somnolence), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other components, against adrenergic active substances or lauatadin (other medicines for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from constrain glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), urinary retention (hypertension), hyperthyreosis (hypertension), hyperthyreosis (hypertension caused by cerebral hemorrhage) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to transport Aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking it, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">"" "" "" "aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms diminish.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, as long-term use may reduce the activity of pseudoephedrine over time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergoid, dihydroergotamine or other deconjunctiva which are used perorally or nasal as a source of rhinoline (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxybutazoline, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient group and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or amplification of the headaches) must be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Treatment of the following patient groups is advised: • Patients under digitalis • Patients with heart rhythm disorders • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the Anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder retention or bronchospasm in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and the placebo-treated patients regardless of whether or not desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the loratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, however, experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstriktoric properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to a dizziness that can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible oral procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, scary Miktion, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is especially likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (mouth dryness, pupillary rigidity and - dilatation, reddening, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight rate including the amplification of subjective punctuality or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily, there was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestation of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged 12 and 78 took part in seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of aerobic tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerobic tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerobic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of dosing in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted using the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was noted that four subjects of Desloratadin were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole gift of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was the exposure after administration of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional safety pharmacology studies, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproduction toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not reveal any special dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">The pharmaceutical vigilance system described in Module 1.8.1 is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials on seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness has been measured by determining the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrants, impairment of sleep and performance on days) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution for insertion and the melt tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the symptom score (symptom score) of 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria, the symptom scores were reduced after six weeks with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1730">There is limited experience in clinical studies of efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the current course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms are terminated and resumed when reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), the patient may be recommended during the allergy period an ongoing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">A clinical pharmacological study did not increase the performance of alcohol while taking Aerius and alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to dizziness, which can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue (1,2%), mouth dry (0,8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, which occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and with 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study in which up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose) were administered.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-fold of the clinical dose) over ten days, no prolongation of the Qtc interval was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight rate including the amplification of subjective punctuality or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis can also be classified according to the duration of symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Allergic rhinitis are defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis are defined as the onset of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown by the overall score of the questionnaire regarding quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined as representative for further forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology is similar in different forms, irrespective of aetiology, and chronic patients can be easily recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamine is a causative factor in all prophetic diseases, it is expected that besides the chronic idiopathic urticaria, desloratadin will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and reduction of size and number of quadriceps at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin in comparison to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study where patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients reached a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation after once daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic occurs when a new strain of the flu virus arises, which can easily be spread by humans to humans because humans have not yet established immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the part of the flu virus as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This means that the immune system will later be able to make contact with a flu virus of this common type faster antibody.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as a foreign body), is cleaned up and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not conducted according to the" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">Thus, the scope of the clinical data base was not sufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to intake, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Aperiase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out what antiviral drugs the patient has taken before, and the likelihood that the virus will respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines are taken.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of aperiase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS cannot heal, but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protesters.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenase enhanced with low dose Ritonavir was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used earlier proteasehemence.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the alteration of the viral load following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo after 48 weeks, but Agenase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced the viral load, but only very few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase strengthened the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenase, together with Ritonavir, was able to increase viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who had further received their proteasehemence:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of aperiase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenase may also not be used in patients who use St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or pharmaceuticals, which are degraded just as aperiase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), an osteonecrose (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of aperiase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years were outweighed over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Aperiase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of aperiase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken proteasinhibitors has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "" "" "in October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited approval for the use of aperiase in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pretreated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually aperiase capsules are given to pharmacokinetic boosters of Amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and patient pretreatment (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than by Amprenavir as capsule; hence, Agenase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for aperiase capsules is 600 mg Amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (boostery), higher doses of aperiase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for aperiase capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of atherase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Aperiase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to lack of data on harmlessness and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose of aperiase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenase should not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-issoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the use of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that aperiase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with aperiase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Ageneric drugs should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal disease progression.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant medical information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticason or other glucocoorticoids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly influenced by CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of aperiase with lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who use these medicines at the same time, aperiase may be less effective because of decreased plasma levels of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for opatological symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir can be administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenase solution, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Aperiase should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving an antiretroviral therapy including proteasinhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy medications needed to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In Hämsophile patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematoma and hemoarthritis are present.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial eology is adopted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecsis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width are not permitted at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-issoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width asgenerase with Ritonavir may not be combined with medicines whose ingredients are mainly metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir that can lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already receives St. John's wort, the amber mirror and, if possible, check the viral load and suspend the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, on the other hand, reduced by 30% for CMAx when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg Amprenavir were used twice a day and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, confirming the efficacy and harmlessness of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% humiliated when Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved by the combination of Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a close monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study to use amgenerase in combination with Didanosin, however, due to the imaginative component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenase lie at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both proteasehemence would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised, as Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasmholes.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, as an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentrations (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with aperiase, a reduction in dose of rifabutin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenase in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg Ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2,69fold compared to the value that after 200 mg ketoconazole was observed once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or CYP3A4 inductors, may cause interactions together with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if used in combination with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasehemence it is advisable that Antazida not be taken at the same time as aperiase since it can come to erectile dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anti-convulants known as enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma receptors of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine and verapamil can be increased by Amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous use with aperiase can considerably increase its plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days to test subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous dispensation of aperiase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids unless the possible benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in the plasma bars are expected at the same time as aperiase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased at the same time of amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be used together with midazolam (see Section 4.3) while using Agenerase with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam for 3 to 4-cases.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for opatological symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir can be administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given, such as the amprenavior dose, if Amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with aperiase, increased control of the INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dose of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time as Agenase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir related substances have been detected in the milk lactation rats, but it is not known whether Amprenavir is transferred to breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, administered by the nistation in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a decreased increase in 12 body weight in seed during lactation.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the descendants including fertility and reproductive ability was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">The side effects associated with the aperiase treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely led to the termination of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are related to the use of aperiase or another drug used to treat HIV or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of aperiase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, and laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and faal fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophie of breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation (stitches).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral non-pretreated individuals who had been treated with Amprenavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stitches) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study, 2,45 NRTIs treated patients under Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs for a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapulöser nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Amprenavir had to be broken off.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonecsis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg of aperiase twice daily along with low dose Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and incidence of side effects (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were very common in patients who received aperiase along with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyprotein precursors with the result of a formation of involuntary, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmic Concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-pretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritonavir-baked treatment schemas with proteaseininhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen out of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg Fosamprenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice a day in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically tested.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, I54L / M / T / V, I54L / M / T / V, I54M, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its prolongation APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) with protease inhibitors, patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, following proteasinhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Prototype analysis systems based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasehemence resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">Current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with increased phenotypic resistance on Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir and a reduced likelihood of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance tests can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasehemence resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypic Cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance pathways, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-pretreated patients, in which a Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 insulates), Darunavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 insulates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 insulates), saquinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 insulates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 insulates) appear.</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other proteasehemence-resistant isolates; the receipt of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a seeding therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that can adversely affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">Evidence of the efficacy of amgenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which PI pre-treated adults after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly combined with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with decreased virus sensitivity to Agenase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis demonstrated the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group with regard to time-adjusted AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-loss threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of untreated asterase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pretreated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies aperiase solution for intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low-dose Ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell numbers of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefit of" "" "unbleached" "" "Agenase should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the mean duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508%, on the other hand, reduced by 30% for CMAx when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was impacted by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of Amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound Amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Steady State over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or represent a CYP3A4 substrate must be administered with caution when given at the same time with aperiase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily Amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenase Solution and Agenerative capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of kidney dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg Amprenavir twice a day without simultaneous dosing of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amprenavir of mice and rats, hepatellular adenomas occurred in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8- (rat) exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hepatellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present exposure data to humans, both from clinical trials and therapeutical applications, there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse-lymphom test, microcore test of rats and chromosomal aberration tests on human peripheral lymphocytes included, Amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far no significant liver toxicity was observed in clinical studies, neither during administration of aperiase after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control and in the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly below (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dose to humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus juggling and minor skeletal changes were observed which point to delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are used without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (boostery), higher doses of aperiase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for aperiase capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use should be treated with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Aperiase should be set in duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with drug dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir that can lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increases, on the other hand, reduced by 30% for CMAx when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved by the combination of Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosing recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a close monitoring is recommended because the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both proteasehemence would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, as an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with aperiase, a reduction in dose of rifabutin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose 31, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>

<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days to test subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with aperiase, increased control of the INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg ethinylestradiol plus 1,0 mg norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin of Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, administered by the nistation in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in body weight in descendants during lactation.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of Agenase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of an overdose, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmic concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Vice versa, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other proteasehemence-resistant isolates; the receipt of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, treatment optimisation should be taken into consideration when using PI pretreated children for the expected benefit of "unbleached" aperiase.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Steady State over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or represent a CYP3A4 substrate must be administered with caution when given at the same time with aperiase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than by Amprenavir as capsule; hence, Agenase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">Patients should, once they are able to swallow the capsules, stop taking the solution for intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2101">The recommended dose for aperiase solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml) Amprenavir / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2800 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">Additionally, since there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of aperiase solution for insertion and low dose Ritonavir can be avoided, this combination can be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although a dose adaptation for amprenavir is not considered necessary, an application of Agenase Solution is contraindicated in patients with kidney failure (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a consequence of the high propylene glycol content, Agenerase solution is contraindicated in infants and children under 4 years, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2105">Simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life-threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders (z).</seg>

<seg id="2195">The treatment of basal cell carcinoma with imiquimine within 1 cm around the eyelids, the nose, the lips, or the hairline has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are common, but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or reactions form after completion of the treatment with imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions, a treatment break of several days can be made.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since no data on long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment are available, other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered in superficially cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Patients with recurrent and pretreated BCCs do not have any clinical experience, therefore the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumors (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower probability of response to imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not studied for the treatment of actinic keratinies on eyelids, inside the nose or in the ears or on the lip area within the lipid.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Very limited data about the application of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratinies on anatomical places outside the face and scalp are available.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratoplasty on the lower arms and hands does not support effectiveness in this application, so this application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions frequently occur, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong, the treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 acute lesions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Because of the immune-stimulating properties, Imiquimodine cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, degeneration or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although neither after one-off or after several topical use of quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml), no recommendation can be given during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly reported and probable or possibly with the application of imiquimod cream related side effects in trials involving three times a week treatment were local reactions in the location of the treatment of the tilt warts (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of imiquimod cream related side effects include discomfort on the application site with an incidence of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basalioma patients treated by 185 with Imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probably or possibly with the application of imiquimod-cream related to the side effect were in these studies a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects indicated by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with Imiquimod-cream treated patients with actinic keratoplasty are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">These clinical signs, according to the test plan, show that these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod Cream often result in local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), Exkoriation / Ableaves / Absorbs (23%) and oedema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This assessed according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream it was very common to severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and to severe scarf formation and salutation (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the use of imiquimine for the treatment of actinic keratoplasty, Alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral recording of 200 mg imiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically most serious side-effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination, systemic concentrations of alpha-interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in regards to a complete healing of the cowwarts in imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the patients treated with imiquimod a total of 119 patients healed completely; this was in 20% of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo-treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod over 6 weeks was investigated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superfictional basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic acne lesions within a coherent 25 cm2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% for patients with clinical precipitation after one or two treatment periods (35 / 128 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications External Feignices, actinic keratoplasty and superficiary basal cell carcinoma do not usually occur in paediatric patients and therefore were not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials on children aged 2 to 15 years with molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages investigated (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic inclusion of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratoplasty was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest disease concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12,5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated obvious half-life was about 10 times higher than the two-hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with actinic keratoplasty or superfictional basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity at rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study on the dermal application carried out for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumours in the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for humans due to systemic exposure is considered very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the drug-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopathysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the movements more difficult, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices, and patients may need medication before administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly examined for the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effectiveness in the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years of age, Aldurazyme decreased GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review every year any new information that may be known and necessary to update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyme in terms of reactions to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. approval for the introduction of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopathysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment where recovery facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, nearly all IgG antibodies against laronidase are usually formed, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience in the resumption of the treatment after a longer break, the risk of hypersensitivity after an interruption of treatment must be cautious due to the risk of hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes prior to the onset of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyetic) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of a mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be weighed and / or reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procain, because there is a potential risk of interfering with intracellular intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns exposed to breast milk from the mother's milk, it is recommended that during the treatment with Aldurazyme not to breastfeed.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to aldurazyme that were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years are often found in the following table: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing stops and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable drug effects related to aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly heavy follow-up and a treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a seroconversion occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, whereby the patient aged less than 5 years later came to a seroconversion (on average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature ejection of the study) 13 / 45 patients showed no antibodies detected by radioactivity (RIP) assay, including 3 patients in whom there was never any seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with inflow to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine, while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG was observed in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with incidence of undesirable drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme therapy is one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzymatic activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the blood circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study covering the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients from the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute hearing test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme for further 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and the conductivity shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the total lung volume increased further proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">The 26 patients with a hepatomacaly before treatment reached 22 (85%) up to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the GAG mirrors in the urine (µg / mg of Kreatinin) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease incidence between patients taking into account clinically significant changes across five efficacy variable (expected percentage normal FEV, distance in 6-minute hearing, movement of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe form and 4 with medium flow form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- levels in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-Score for this age group. the younger patients with the mean follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe version-form only limited or no progress in cognitive development was to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations into pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyme dosing schemas were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent an acceptable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to those with older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional research on safety pharmacology, toxicity in a unique gift, toxicity in repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data cannot detect any special dangers for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2353">Preparation of the Aldurazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • Depending on the body weight of the individual patient first determine the number of piercing bottles to be diluted.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to easily spread to other parts of the body. • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer, which does not attack the squamous cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the gift of cisplatin, an "antiemetics" (pharmaceuticals against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a lack of fluid) should be given before or after the addition of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood-image changes or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, removed or the dose is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed slows down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to split.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetrexed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study on 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells during the administration of Alimta showed longer survival times than with the comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued approval to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the placing of Alimta in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each piercing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a 25 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose sis is taken from the penetration bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml further (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with lo-, advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial cancer, except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- Infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the pemetremixed administration and the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days prior to the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first mixed dose as well as after each third movement cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetrexed, a complete blood-picture should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place under the recovery of the Nadir of the blood pattern or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop hematological toxicity ≥ degrees 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reductio, or at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or older, an increased side effect risk was increased compared to patients aged 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatinin-clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatine-clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- bordervalue and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the absence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-times of the upper limit (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with regard to bone immunosuppression and Pemetrexed may not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophal count has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number once again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocytes and maximum non-hematological toxicity as observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-abatological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was disregarded when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed have to be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophy- laktic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous use of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistica (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for treatment with Pemetrexed need to avoid taking NSAIDs for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients during which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, a drainage of the outflow before the Pemetrexed treatment is to be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials using Pemetrexed, if this drug was commonly administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible peeling of the reproductive ability is due to Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the treatment order, advice regarding the sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can result in a reduced pemetremixed excretion resulting in increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is required if in patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid are applied in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs are available with a long half-life like Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use with Pemetrexed has to be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- and antimetabolites, serious birth defects are expected in the pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy except if it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to Pemetrexed, men should be advised prior to the start of treatment, advice regarding the blocking of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetrexed mixed into breast milk and unwanted effects of breastfeeding infants cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with Mesothelioma and randomised cisplatin and Pemetrexed - and 163 patients with Mesothelioma, who were randomised to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic anti-folate which performs its effect by interrupting wich- and folc-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed acts as an antifolate with several approaches by blocking the thymidylatsynthase (DHFR), Dihydrofolatreductase (DHFR) and Glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are the folate-dependent key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymid- and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multi-center, randomised, simply blind phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and cisplatin had a clinically important advantage of a survival compared to median 2.8-months compared to those patients who were only treated with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction in adults with overweight (BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 body mass index) and should be used in conjunction with a lightly hypokaline, fat-based diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is not enough data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Because Orlistat is only minimally resorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and for patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single-meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with an improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a physician or pharmacist prior to treatment with alli, because the dosage of the antidiabetic must be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who are alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmacist if the dosage of this medicine needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on the interaction of drugs as well as in several cases with the simultaneous use of orlistat and ciclosporin a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">For the use of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (international normalised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat up to 4 full years in clinical trials, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and the beta-carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a complementary multivitamin preparation before bedtime to ensure adequate vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">Following the gift of a one-time dose Amiodarone, a marginal decrease in Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are linked to the pharmacological effect of the drug, since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known side-effects noted after the launch of orlistat is unknown, since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">It is plausible that treatment with alli can cause anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multi-dose doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In majority of cases of orlistat overdose reported after market launch, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a quick recovery of possible systemic effects caused by the laboriental properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is used in the lumens of the stomach and the upper small intestine through covalent bonding to the active Serin-rest of the gastrian and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical studies with BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat taken three times a day in combination with hypokaline, fat-based diets.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to baseline value (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those participating in study, which have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their original weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average dietary change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2,8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average LDL cholesterol was measured with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (initial value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metallized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, not metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients, where the minimal systemic resorbiased dose was administered, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after cleavage of the N-Formyl-leucine group), were identified, which represented nearly 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, which are moderate for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, dioxorubicine or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of aloxi can be increased by adding a Corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years is not recommended as there is not enough information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient is binding a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies on 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies which are strong or moderate for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies that are moderate savior for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued approval to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. it was approved by Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and for prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon, patients should be monitored closely with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advised with simultaneous dispensing of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi will not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palonosetron did not block the activity of the five chemotherapeutics examined against tumors (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, Cycloabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single IV dose of palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration of oralen metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population based pharmacokinetic analysis, CYP2D6 inductors (dexethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Doxorubicin, Fluoxetine, Ranitidin, Ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience on the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies does not occur, therefore palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which at least could be associated with aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of delivery (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequency of adverse events occurred as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, but due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for Aloxi- overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients received a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicum (half-life 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-life 7.3 hours), which was given intravenously on Day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received strong immunetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron on day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters were comparable with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Following the findings of preclinical investigations, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Absorption After intravenous administration, an initial decrease of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentrate time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosisproportional in the entire dose range of 0.3- 90 μ / kg in doses and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following intravenous administration of palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentrations was measured at 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days, the overall composition (AUC0- ∞) was comparable to that measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the disposable intake of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated via the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser degree, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose were recovered within 144 hours in the urine, palonosetron as unaltered agent made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time IV injection injection, the total body-body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminale elioration period and the average systemic exposure with palonosetron are increased, but a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only according to expositions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, indicating a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 The preclinical studies revealed that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and can prolong the period of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded in approximately the 30x of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased incidence of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high dosages and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the Medicines Agency for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicines").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) Hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In the case of a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damage the liver tissue, in addition, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are further increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon submitted data showing the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the medicine, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference physician to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed was not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease resumed more patients than in reference to the reference drug; Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine is immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection accompanied by a crust formation) and small infected infirmations (cracking or cuts), abrasions and wound wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been provably or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alarcon may not have an effect on these kinds of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under the age of 18 may not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thus inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy in all five studies was the proportion of patients whose infection was clung to the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin findings, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar rates of response: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin findings, about 90% of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was noted that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections outweigh the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">"" "" "" "in May 2007, the European Commission informed the company Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the launch of Altargo in the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitization or serious local irritation due to the use of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is canceled, the ointment is carefully wiped out and appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary infected open wounds, the efficacy of Retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2-3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical means on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been reached in people after topical application on swollen skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on skuled skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dosage adjustments are not required if topical reapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in terms of a statement about the effect on birth and fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Retapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding should be continued / completed or the treatment with Altargo should be continued / completed is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections used by Altargo, the most frequently reported side effect of irritation at the place of delivery, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding points of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the Bindungsstelle ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the transfer of peptide, partly blocking P-binding interactions, preventing the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of Retapamulin in at least some infection forms appears questionable, advice should be pursued by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of a non-response to the treatment with S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion to intact and skulled skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 with the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic involvement in people after topical use of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of swollen skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microphones was primarily conveyed by CYP3A4, with less involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma-test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats-micronucleus test for the in-vivo study of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which resulted in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of scratched skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryonic oxidation study on rats at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan consisting of two doses can be ended.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresing dose against hepatitis A or B is desirable, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines act as they" "" "teach" "" "the immune system (the natural defence of the body), as it can defend itself against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and generates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccine approved since 1996, and the approved vaccine of Twinrix since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as proof for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the share of vaccinated children, who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to a six-month distance between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matiness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active agents, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the Grundimmunization with Ambirix consists of two doses of vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose ranges between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster is required for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) and anti-HBsAg (anti-HAV) antibody levels are in the same magnitude as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to a hepatitis A- vaccination need a booster vaccination as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory even in case of no more detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the use of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units of formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-virus and anti-HBs antibody levels, so that the dose of additional doses may be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal imputation, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In the case of thrombocytopenia or blood coagulation, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneous as an exception, as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined diphtheri-, Tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza vaccine type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, matiness, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomerus and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 up to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and skill on a calculation basis per Vaccine Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the dose of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of a dose of 3-doses combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix had pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of amicity was comparable to per proband (i.e. about the total vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects received Ambirix compared to 36.2% in subjects receiving the 3-doses combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and angulation was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-doses vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1-11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed in combination with the 3-doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a common incidence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination-vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to 15 years, seroconversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">Serum conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year olds, 142 two doses Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinant vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the dose of the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1-11-year-olds one month after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received either a 2-doses vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccination scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were at the time of priming between 12 and 15 years, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study was comparable to that obtained after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalinininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme compared to that in the 0-12 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year was administered simultaneously with the creation of a combined diphtheri-, Tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults demonstrated the current formulation of similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as for previous formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 cans.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before the intake of both Vines Ambirix (although you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of your vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after a Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection cannot be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may occur due to itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath, or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to a previous vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child have a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a hepatitis B protection (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled dose of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / her child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B Vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface coating).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected by persons suffering from severe blood clotting disorders, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defense / is or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Say to your doctor if you / your child are taking other medicines (including those that you can get without prescription) or if you / your child has been vaccinated recently / has been given or has been planned or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as many limb as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix will not be given pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is urgently needed that they will be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without pins and in packs of 50 without pins.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that have become known since obtaining the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP has the opinion that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only placed in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited because of low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammoneseed can also be used in patients aged over one month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonia mic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is - divided into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or via a gastropod (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since ammonaps could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo (a fake medication, that is, without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammoneseed may also cause loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, impotence, fluid retention, taste problems, or taste, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonium in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammoneseed was approved under "exceptional circumstances" because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information about this drug was available.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first life-month), there is an indication of use when a hyperammonia encephalopathy exists in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithinly transcarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency have to receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk of the formation of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and demdemformation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate takes place via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous formulation of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it was a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and decreased number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted by humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS 56% of patients had at least an undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdosing occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms involve the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity at intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolical active compound which conjugates with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Topometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogenous atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment will start immediately to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative methods of nitric excretion (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns at postpartal (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygotic form of the ornithinly transcarbamylase deficiency), which were treated by hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible during treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylacetate is known to be oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in the liver and kidneys with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were determined 15 minutes after ingesting.</seg>
<seg id="2846">According to different doses phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), phenylacetate in the plasma was detectable in the next morning after a different dose of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day).</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the medium phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma pass were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion This medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate was not treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken either orally (infants and children who can not swallow tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastropod or a nose probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithinly transcarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrate, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rats were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat) prior to the birth, lesions in the pyramidal cells of the brain cortex occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Topometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogenous atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to excretion surplus</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it is possible to assume that sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible in the treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were determined 15 minutes after ingesting.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the period of durability, the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must notify the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS as sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken, even if it is a non-prescription drug.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stroke" (an abnormal measured value of electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) using conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulan) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient often was a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent a closure) and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without gift of GPI - in the prevention of new events (death cases, heart attacks or reascularization) after 30 days or a year altogether as effective as the conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was as effective in terms of all indicators as Heparin, except for severe bleeding, where it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued approval to the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the injunction of angioplasty across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (instabile angina / non-ST-stroke infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a IV mg / kg intravenous bolus followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient subsequently performs a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours following clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, an injection of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous injections of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a directly subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single injection of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and administered intravenously at intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer necessary, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with severe kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which is subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is under 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second half dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with severe kidney damage, included in the III- PCI study (REPLACE-2) included for approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after giving the Bivalirudine-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against Hirudine • Active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disorder of the hemostasesystems and / or irreversible coagulation disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis-based patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when a bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of the arterial puncture points occur in PCI patients under Bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can occur in principle everywhere bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with a bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivalirudin is once again achieved prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the active mechanism of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocytes), it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are regularly checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experimental studies are inadequate in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, degeneration or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or ennoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalirudine group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin were more frequent in women and for patients over 65 years of experience than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleedings were defined according to ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleeding as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and BivaliDrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hematoma or bleeding in the points area, which required radiological or surgical intervention, reduction of haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding center, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed bleeding localizations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" points points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin were more frequent in women and patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organclasses in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with a bivaliruine is immediately removed and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and on the anion binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalirudin to thrombin, and hence its effect, is reversible because Thrombin on its part splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, a bivaliruine with serum from patients, in which it had occurred in the past to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is evidenced by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was carried out following a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, fractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either prior to angiography (at the time of randomization) or PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients who required angiography within 72 hours were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent an angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1-year endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and clopidogrel according to the protocol (prior to angiography or prior to PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudine as peptide passes a catabolism into its amino acid components with subsequent revaluation of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the cleavage of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence by Thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of Thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children aged six and over with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thigh or upper arm or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or can not process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin ulisin is very slightly different from Humaninsulin, and the change means that it acts more quickly and has a shorter active duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and seventeen years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot be processed effectively, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the alteration of the concentration of substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin doses.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin ulisin or any of the other components, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of Apidra in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, thigh or delta or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced glucose-ogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin demand in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active force, the brand (manufacturers), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-related diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The switch from one patient to another insulin type or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of the dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active ingredient of the insulin used and can therefore change when migrating the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">They include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxylic, salamylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Additionally, under the effects of sympathizolytics such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethiine and reserve the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humaninsulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin is transferred into human breast milk, but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the undesirable medications known from clinical studies grouped according to system organclasses and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000); not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive dog, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Eyelpodystrophies edged to continuously change the injection point within the injection unit, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous glucosis by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucoline injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to detect the cause of severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (especially by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous ga- be of insulin lulisin the action occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes, insulin lulisin in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a disproportionate glucostic effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more an underproportional increase in the glucosising effect, just like Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucostic effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postdenpranic glycemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Was insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal, a better postdenpranic control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is applied in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control as with human normal insulin, which is given two grooves prior to meal (see Figure 1), is reached.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at a dose of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin at a dose of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
