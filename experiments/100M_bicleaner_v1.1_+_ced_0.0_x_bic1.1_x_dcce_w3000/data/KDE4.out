the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making it easier to access .
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , and the built @-@ in features can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions .... Open the map tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of default settings modules from the node ; add@@ ons . please note that if you have additional software installed on your system , you may need more modules .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which is &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on Tools crashes . then you can view the page , which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or drop the list of crashes if available .
the view filter module ( also called Fol@@ der Filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar with Tools pane filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as a default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View is to display ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be detected if it is far down in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched via View color mode , can represent either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or mapping of another file property , such as name , owner , group , or M@@ IME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is sufficient space for displaying or if the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angle is to be used ( whereby , therefore , display errors may occur due to restrictions on the character of the tre@@ em@@ ap ) .
in case of representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always observed . there are frames drawn to avoid the ne@@ sting of entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
how spl@@ itting the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this context , it is possible to divide areas in such a way that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods for this are lines , columns or recur@@ rent branches .
you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry above the menu item View View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application of c@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
you can find the picture gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , menu under Extras Gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the Picture Gallery , a dialog opens for you to set the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option Images per line has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
with the check@@ box fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , specify whether the fil@@ en@@ ames are shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
to view the file size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , specify whether the size of the images will be shown in the gallery in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included .
in the file choos@@ er Save to HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the Sub@@ folder check box , you can set up with a slider or a rotation field to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
with the original pictures you can copy the original pictures to the gallery .
with the comment file check box , you can specify a commentary file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
for the thumb@@ nails you can set a different color depth in the check box to set a different color depth than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area , and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
change browser recognition adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , which allows you to change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the standard browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change browser recognition in one of the following options .
changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject access to browsers based on Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of information on the used browser and the operating system in the individual .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and upload your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ kam ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported with the library g@@ Photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use this to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plu@@ gins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit colour space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; Program@@ s is also &amp; edited ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or desires report .... This opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these short@@ cuts , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all required information is entered here . follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; gt ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that the user and developer help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam .
you can also check the digi@@ kam ; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for announ@@ cing in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; edited ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can enter a local , remote or remote folder here . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data backup is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; edited ; will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ Library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folder . &amp; edited ; considered every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is changed .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and putting this on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can edit &amp; edit your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Record i@@ ste to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it &apos;s possible to handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported resource cameras in the Help File Support menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and upload your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ kam ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported with the library g@@ Photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions over the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 .
lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules with all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to perform themselves .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or to another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to make the most common : JPEG , PNG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields displayed in the symbol view currently . thus , filtering works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only when this is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single alb@@ um@@ tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the albums properties or by the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select album Import screen@@ shot .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them onto the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties from the pop @-@ up menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can group them under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos if you choose to add or delete albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums by date sort .
buttons oldest , average , new : these set the date for the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder instead .
if you first select an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo onto the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be contained in a collection and collections cannot be oc@@ cured .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My word@@ list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures will be shown in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
if you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by re@@ generating all thumb@@ nails in the Extras menu .
information on each image will be displayed below the preview . what information this is , you can edit edited , edit . select the Albums page here and customize the preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help buttons which appear when you let the mouse cursor rest for a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important properties including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section Intro@@ duction to the main window displays such a help window .
photos are all that it was with &amp; digi@@ kam . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can select all the features that with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you have the choice between viewing the images , a slideshow or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and select Edit ... Select . in the section digi@@ kam , you will find a guide on how to edit your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type sub@@ menu .
you should note that after editing by other image editing programs , there can be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to right @-@ click on the preview and select Dre@@ ams . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , you can right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you maintain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it is moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; edited ; used for it either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown .
photos with key words provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again .
when a keyword is selected , all photos displayed with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ wor@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; to fold the keywords that you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the keywords are re @-@ imported when the database is lost ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My key word ; or click on an existing keyword . if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and drop there . then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking on it and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My tick quot ; .
to select another photo as an album icon , click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the pop @-@ up menu . in addition , you can drag the photo onto the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you choose the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; drag and drop it . alternatively , you can also right click on the preview of the pictures and select keywords from the context menu .
you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have finished a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window under the thumb@@ nail preview .
you can use a keyword to open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu only displays the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the time beam view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , just click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the frame box , which indicates the time unit .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
includes all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
if you click on it , the filtering will be deleted and all images will be shown again . if the search has not found , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search is done . the search function is used to assign a name to my search list in the View menu . if you want to change your selection after search , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the form will appear to enter the search again with the previously entered search information . if you choose to edit as advanced search , the dialog for advanced search appears to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select the context menu search .
advanced Search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . an option can be added to this list with search group / Search group or deleted from it . each option can be associated with others about the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or least ... you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NO@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare by comparing these sign@@ atures . the less the difference between two image sign@@ atures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar one . if you push a picture from somewhere on the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free hand color sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; edited ; find the matching pictures . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can zoom in or zoom out or hold it on the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em Li@@ gh@@ table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window will be opened .
from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare , to the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select preview synchron@@ ize from the toolbar , then you will also execute the same area of both pictures .
another mode is better suited to get out of a picture series quickly . if you use pair @-@ wise navigate from the toolbar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to the same . now , use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images .
of course the normal dele@@ tion actions work directly from the lighting table , e.g. F@@ 4 File Edi@@ ting ....
all image information from the right side of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to rotate the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both pictures will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . simply use the Zoom knob under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both images if you are looking at the preview mode .
digital continu@@ ance management considers every part of the process as follows after the image has been taken to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digital photos performs a form of digital continu@@ ance management . most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect and use your pictures . we look at downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , group@@ ing , group@@ ing , securing , evaluating , reporting , archiving , optimi@@ zing , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; digital continu@@ ance management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , fabri@@ c@@ ates and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data administered by an application or environment .
I dare to say that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to find a specific photo without inventory management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach allows you to save metadata both in a database and in the image files , and secure archiving to which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you have to decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive , etc ; note that you will have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for that content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative picture .
we also recommend the option to save metadata in the Met@@ adata Settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do so , edited a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should now choose any photo keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos at the further work .
now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , how you frequently call other programs , or proceed to categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded key@@ words , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically create the tree for you or insert images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are updated by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while the sub@@ trees are followed .
the graph shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation because each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then catch some details to see people , the place .
and now I say to you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream , associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence .
for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to generate interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help him about the motive that moved you has to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . K@@ DE even provides a spell check . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will not tell you a second time for publication .
remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now moves with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit ge@@ ol@@ ok@@ alization are countless and will continue in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels by means of pictures with geographic data . &amp; edited ; can also export k@@ ml files you can use with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions , thus also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , for example in order to protect the identity of the photographer , it should not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author title : associated with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s work description . examples can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here , which offers you the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change the metadata embedded in the image . for individuals , this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; edited ; in the near future such a module will be available for batch processing .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs lost on the street or a fire . this kind of loss is the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics about the reasons for data loss .
in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , this careful treatment must be handled and you can no longer trust you for more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your discretion room .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you are just written . that &apos;s why they use a control hum@@ ming mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are just effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control loops . despite this massive protection they are al@@ er@@ ting through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said about CDs and DVDs is of course also true for Blu @-@ ray disc .
slow down with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . then read the data again to check you . likewise , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store them on a clean , dark dry and in front of animals .
disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this subject : dis@@ kette study
in brief : dis@@ ks hold the longest if you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in lower temper@@ aments , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common fault cause , S@@ MAR@@ T can not detect these errors .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can normally be restored without any major problems .
while most electrical devices do not make a lot of electricity , this can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the inevitable result of a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector strip . remember , however , that not each connector also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should note that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers produce over@@ voltage distri@@ butions , which also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for co@@ axial cables of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds may lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models allow you even to continue working until the current runs out . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security in case of power disrup@@ tions with the cost to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can you get up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - easy storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software .
you are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but there is no general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures available in full resolution online .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all trans@@ missions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . it &apos;s quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer until one day . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by trans@@ missions problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss on the not@@ ebook and 46 % on work@@ stations . in case of not@@ ebooks , the share of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage than for example th@@ ef@@ ts or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deterior@@ ating . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not worry anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected each year by a data loss . so , backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash hits you if the drive wasn &apos;t connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . don &apos;t forget an aircraft gap : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , a common reason for data loss despite security is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : backup of files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time at which such a backup was made . this backup comes with a version@@ ing system closest to the exception that it is only scann@@ ed and not running continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference between files that were actually changed .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
topic : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , retain associated X@@ MP files , retain original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retrieve images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visualization , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is approximately the period in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while the time goes by . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the fewer variations you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . do not use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing size .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned scal@@ ability with planned and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . for * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g to see if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
/ dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of stimulus if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no more software that can be read , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG has been designed as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and has a slow compression .
TI@@ FF has been widely used as picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( de@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people .
DN@@ G The digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open format format developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G is now available based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file themselves . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your photo , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put it together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera image are , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ kam , then you should add the metadata again . they may be cut off by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them into web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Add a Photos to an Album you will find a description of how you can add photos you have already on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and switch it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start using the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig indicator will appear at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab Met@@ adata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS etc of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all . this loads all photos from their camera into one single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired ones with the standard selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download Sel@@ ected .
if your camera supports this , an option Neue Download is available . in this case the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures will be downloaded .
the list of existing albums is displayed in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums , such as normal folder , in section My Albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; nbsp ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once by del@@ eting Del@@ ete All . if you just want to delete a few , you must first select them and then delete the chosen ones .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded into &amp; edited ; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames in case you upload photos of different shooting galleries to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image has been made in the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder is automatically created per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you wish to use a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S , for example . for more customiz@@ ations , you should read the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ kam , is used for a photo , is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ adata you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced and select Auto Rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam ; use this to automatically download sub@@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is normally off , and in this case it saves &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in length and width gra@@ dients and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graph@@ ite an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architects and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser with a click , which indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how does the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and finally via manual input of known locations .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work together with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in the GP@@ X format , since this is the only format supported by the module for geographic mapping .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre @-@ signed coordinates that are created for example from map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you as much control over its workflow as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to set @-@ up in the menu Options . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fixed when you click an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface . even with database synchronization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for summary line : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s profession . these can be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate the name of the photo . this does not need to be the author , if he is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations should be registered here , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this will ensure that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not just in the &amp; digi@@ kam database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam , without going lost .
save images as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the in@@ scrip@@ tions embedded in the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; edited ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; any file in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions has been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
the brightness of &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . each time you open the illuminated table , these settings are switched on when possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size , you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are fixed here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling , the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more details .
with the PNG compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can put this value on high compression .
with the TI@@ FF option you can comp@@ ress the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect image quality as the de@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
save loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files by setting loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files . even if you select the los@@ s@@ less settings , the ratio between quality loss and file size is much better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , the image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently it is developing very quickly into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing .
the default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a mesh pattern in the output . this option records the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when white balance is not set . standard it is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the top lights , i.e. the parts of your images that are burned out due to the inability of your camera to catch the top lights in the settings . use the setting of transparent white in the settings . the setting colors trigger some unusual results as it displays the pointed lights in various rose tones . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the not yet saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the option re@@ construct , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted individually for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub @-@ raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of color pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provides three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . pic@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color deviation correction , since you are carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates color information and gives instructions like this one should be given back . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from one colour space to the other can be translated to allow the colors to be as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions if an image is opened in the image editing / color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles .
settings of ICC @-@ Pro@@ files You have the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , which you can em@@ ulate about how to re @-@ use your image from a device . this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can work very saturated . this could manually correct you instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for what is planned for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon Profile Extension lets you recognize the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image editing support . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and these are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes activate the metadata , respectively , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera properties show a list of all currently supported cameras on the left . on the right hand side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . below are the port settings . below are the port settings . currently , here are Seri@@ al , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them into the display mode and turn on .
check if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera , which is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; View images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation between &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find further details in del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes by the right side bar can be used sil@@ ently by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without re@@ viewing . otherwise you need to save the changes using the button change .
you can also display &amp; edit the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ kam . this speeds up under certain circumstances the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
setting Bei@@ m Start for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam ; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something from the base folder was deleted , &amp; digi@@ kam ; you whether it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting the item Display / Edit .
the image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the section Bild@@ bearbeitung .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top , including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file Save or Save the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or button The Re@@ restore image processing button in the toolbar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last Save .
virtually any action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can undo you by selecting Edit Re@@ wards or restored by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should check the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the undo or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can zoom in and out in the photo in which you can use C@@ trl , mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the Outlook menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . normally , the toolbar will display . if you do not want to do so , you can view this in the &amp; digi@@ kam window .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select the Select Job Wi@@ zard from the Album menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; nbsp ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , even in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the margin .
in the label view , you can enter or insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented on it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the in@@ scrip@@ tions are then saved .
besides the user button there is a button More . this allows you to read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done if you chose a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ kam ; session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom of the window is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate tick fields in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the Key@@ word filter side@@ bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search . if additional one or more keyword filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag tags and drop them . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on one calendar day . the keyword filter is based on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword from the right key tree was drawn on the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off in Settings Vari@@ ous .
if you have created a rule with and notice that it should be one or its , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly worked on &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at each point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
their only other image editions are by email or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy , why should you use a different colour space and have to think about color management ?
a visual example of limiting s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to c@@ alli@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor , as s@@ RGB assumes that you are using s@@ RGB . the c@@ alli@@ br@@ ation of your monitor thus closes the circle . if you are working as in the colour space of s@@ RGB , you must either set your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , please use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , synchron@@ ize , automatic reconciliation and contrast expand from the menu correc@@ ting Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ aire values across the entire image so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
like this : this method sel@@ ects the intensity factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . this produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic compensation : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new addition of all values in between . this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited because you can work on a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you can do so too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can do the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , then click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above shows a hist@@ ogram that is changed dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit pictures , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the controls mentioned above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the chosen color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green values are also set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result in white balance . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons do exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can be stored in a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
the Pre@@ ferences button res@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G formats .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour ton@@ mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the chapter color management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under color tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar operation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when using a partially developed pressure a short flash light and then inver@@ ted the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally generates a negative image that so cannot be produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contra@@ st@@ effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it embell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and hence a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not un@@ usually that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos . you can experiment to preview the different color aspects of your photos using the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too large satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of it . all the changes you can perform can be previ@@ ewed in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / G@@ amma the tool is used to improve the exposure . even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slider for the application purpose described here . more specific the three slides below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph are three slides into which can be cli@@ cked and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controls and watch how the image changes .
on the right , the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . on the left @-@ hand side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to specify whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear representation is most useful . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the medium for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color p@@ pet@@ tes can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and light tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . for example , compression of output values can be used to create a ble@@ ached image as background while something else is in the foreground .
automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and rel@@ o@@ aded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , Medium and Sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click to preview the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ant channels .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ cators option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , linear mode is most useful . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode is further useful .
for example , if you move a course part to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker .
previ@@ ewing the original photos is a red marker . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line will appear on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you have created can be stored in the file system and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p file format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and Sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ cators option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if more than one channel is found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel bl@@ ender is another sophisticated tool to mix the colours of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed compared to its own hor@@ semen .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness , as the channel bl@@ ender then is THE tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . color @-@ bre@@ w consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion by reducing the color @-@ bre@@ w first .
the saving and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any mixer setting for later and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ cators option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) can be seen .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of its abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , because color images can be converted easily onto the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well into portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar light scenes at the time of the day . thus , like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ ece : produces warm and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and re @-@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a Pop Art Portrait from enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right to increase the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed one ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way of keeping his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter , you enter the desired frame type for your image . the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , sh@@ kant@@ ami surrounds it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a but@@ ton@@ effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool Fol@@ lowing aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into one image at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the colour space and character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool templates apply you can lay a template on a picture .
the menu image templates apply in image processing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to dimin@@ ish the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam , simply send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the sten@@ cils .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the full picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other fields .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psych@@ otrop@@ ic . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is perhaps the best of the three because it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digital@@ isation process needs colors with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn leads to blur@@ red edges a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG pictures , a camera has often been used internal sharp@@ ness . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers already use a field filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo using the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can call this by using the Cor@@ directional Fol@@ der menu entry .
the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also rein@@ forces the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can focus on more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool for sof@@ tening sof@@ ten@@ er sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first be tried out . an increase in the radius or the amount increase the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , the noise and the impression of gr@@ ats near sharp edges will produce .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images permit larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . this sets the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
the threshold value is a frac@@ ture from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filter . in this way areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ ted from sharpen@@ ing and thus avoid beauty defects in faces , skies and water surfaces .
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted design filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Viennese filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is using a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focus usually achieves better results than blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image processing .
in practice the circular folding works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding . the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixels , which are far from the original tor@@ ell@@ pixel . in most cases , the F@@ IR Viennese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is influenced even very strongly from the distant pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high correlation coefficient reduces the sharp@@ ness of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your blur@@ red line is sch . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the G@@ auss sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations make changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by in@@ sharp mas@@ king a bigger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
theoretically , un@@ sharp masks must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of sharp@@ ness . the result of the F@@ IR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the F@@ IR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied to a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the field correction methods in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the slider smoo@@ thes the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust this here .
the Image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove undes@@ ired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en , France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to smooth smoo@@ thing over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should obtain details so that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
directional dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ arity or CCD Rau@@ schen will create a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is passed . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angular step width since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angular dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . so you should therefore choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step@@ width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step@@ width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you receive by choosing this option is low , but it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to be om@@ itted .
the buttons Save as and Download make exactly this . any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
error correction is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how to fix image errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is an odd black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ lau .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor drivers from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can remain with the default settings .
a radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter needs per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the range indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller errors adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing that the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ous changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication will occur again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or the spi@@ kes can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more ero@@ ded , but also conce@@ als the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase resistance . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may occur at the edges . it can remove smoking tips and is the recommended method for it .
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected version ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little bit sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ ter with the menu entry correc@@ ting sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss &apos;s noise , film bas@@ tion , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or later digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce compression : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ ac@@ quot ; - small standards that are shown in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad do exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
photo Rest@@ oration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Finish button .
below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of photo restor@@ ations . this time tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old colour photo , which was scann@@ ed with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by copyright of Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; in a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the Wi@@ zard with the Dark Image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and light pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark@@ image directly in order to detect new hot or light pixels with CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark@@ image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and automatically loads it in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are highlighted in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
dur@@ ess : an average of the neighbouring pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ i quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many centre filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the necessary shutter speed so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller because otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by motion .
it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s fil@@ men@@ and / gre@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controls , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of intensity atten@@ u@@ ation at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or by chance of a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of exposure of the target image , let the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar curved effect , but flat on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth degree correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , ton@@ ical distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth degree . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the reverse character of the parameter general .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size , resulting in a correction of first degree . negative values increase while positive the image shr@@ inks .
light : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog will illustrate the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start .
the tone or cushion correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best result in this correction as the first one . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect is apparently the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal help line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Trans@@ formers Tri@@ mming tool or via the Zoom knob of this dialog .
for most images the tone @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motifs such as images from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture are 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infr@@ a @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page that is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters for film gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option of joining film gran@@ ulation if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gran@@ ul@@ arity and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
because the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
this is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film bas@@ kets on your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , producers mix large silver bas@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film bas@@ tion effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny look especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film bas@@ tion effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; edited ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the magni@@ fic@@ ence .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smoo@@ thing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon sket@@ ch . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen for you to sket@@ ch out .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default values of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure in which color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divi@@ des the picture into cells and makes it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : similar to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the Finish button .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ per : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by rotation of the pixels around a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distances blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera .
blur@@ ring blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by accidental shifting of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and creates it then , through the filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the Finish button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images .
you can stick with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free from ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ p filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools can be found in the Select Rot@@ ating or Transform@@ ative Refle@@ ction menu .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you restore or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose the transformation size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
preserve aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used for this purpose . any collection for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can last very long and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo blowing by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put a picture together . to cut a photo you simply need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply pressing the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The C@@ trl button for image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl + X ) . use the Save or File Save entries in the File menu to save the newly cro@@ pped photo .
in the preview area you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains unchanged .
when cutting after aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned .
the tool Fol@@ lowing aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches , or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button to trim the area to crop to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
when you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the cooperation help hide help to help you put your pictures together better . these aids are :
harmonious triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ terrestrial angels , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that has different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us mus@@ sels or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we perceive as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden centre provides liqu@@ e@@ fied assistance lines when you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
the golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos . in comparison with the Third Re@@ gel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that distra@@ cts the eye to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the gold spiral discussed above . its verti@@ ces are the central points of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that , unlike harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equally an@@ gled tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve differently .
the Horiz@@ ont@@ al Options mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button Color you can set the color of the lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo , it easily happens that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing and tool @-@ free rotation . choose Select Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slider are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right @-@ hand side .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function Transform@@ osen cutting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is the Automati@@ cally cutting function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after rotation . but note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty spaces that have ar@@ isen through transformation into pixels .
new heights : shows the height of the new image , including the empty spaces that have ar@@ isen through transformation into pixels .
angle to the left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture gets blur@@ red . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transforming trim out of the image processing .
the activation tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and shift the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
rotate your image by using Horiz@@ ont@@ al An@@ gle and Ver@@ tical An@@ gle . you can rotate horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview pane .
move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two cross@@ ings generate twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible at this point to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF underneath .
&amp; edited ; only shows files in formats that you know . this is done using file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it will be edited . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam ; accept . in the configuration section , you will find more information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to even select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; edited ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression methods on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw picture format , you can read in English at Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the configuration section , you can find more information about how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw footage only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that &amp; edited by &amp; digi@@ kam .
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in avi or m@@ peg format . &amp; edited ; but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; edited ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback movies use to start the program playback .

many tools you need to do with editing are available in &amp; edited . your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ ter , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , blur@@ ring masks , &amp; etc ; . use a unified dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
the upper section shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper part shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can zoom in or zoom out or hold it on the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and choose colors .
the pallet files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Di@@ alogue Palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders for files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described below the pallet view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used for selection . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ written or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ writing .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used along with actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character , if another color follows . so if three figures are in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z include are out@@ dated &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Po@@ sters ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; kate ; the graph re@@ comp@@ utes and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; kate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; quot ; component ;
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . needs are in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graphs ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains just the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialogue file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; button ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file that is currently loaded in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; file loaded from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings k@@ graph viewer ; set up ... see also .
when you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; instance or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without header and with another font
the Renew@@ t Shop page gives the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or request the program each time .
the Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is asked .
the session management page gives you the ability to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) or specify to be asked for each start .
the context menu , which appears normally with one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graph . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directional graphs . the algorithm sets edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; Ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ er@@ ect graphs . it produces representations according to the spring spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a boun@@ cing model layout for un@@ er@@ ect graphs . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ link trigger for handling large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the node circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as parameters , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify special options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
specifies the type of graph@@ ene ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ ghted ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ ghted graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse cursor . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tools for representation . it needs the following packages :
a special device is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid in which you draw the icon .
creates a new symbol . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears in which you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template , or whether you want to start re@@ boot from scratch .
re@@ stores the last step revers@@ ed . if you have not made a step back , this function is disabled .
inserts the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gra@@ y@@ scale . this can produce colors that do not correspond to those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de ;
does not change the icon , but sets the current drawing color to the color of the dot on which you click .
the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current canvas , the magni@@ fying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
inserts the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and toolbar .
with the buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove you can modify the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
choose Transpar@@ ent pixel insert or display a link and set a color : or a chess board as a banner . you can also set the size for the ch@@ ess@@ board : the car@@ os on small , medium and large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose .
the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default values duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s own in order to select your image accordingly . look at the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan the image with the button . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner .
make sure that the window is displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the button scanning , wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the image file options appears . please remember that the BM@@ P type does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected the Import / screen@@ shot menu in the Import menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen modes :
select The complete desktop read to read a single window under the mouse .

Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to show your photos to the people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , put photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of creating a token . this is used for your authentication . so , it is your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started to enable you to login with Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r web page . you will be presented the following page after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after clicking Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the Export module is started to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which indicates the current access permissions that the module displays . to upload , you need write permissions . the module currently supports no other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the button Add images should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server starts .
the keywords field can be filled with a separated list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during loading .
with Options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly you can set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you change the option Chan@@ ges the size of the photos before upload , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at Maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ alizing images in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic Loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS trace .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the top @-@ to @-@ looking dialog then appears . to load a possible correlation over time and location , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file .
if the file loads an automatic correlation that shows the coordinates in red . GPS trace data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera icon here .
the setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera distance . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ation is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these boundaries here and then press the cor@@ relate button to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next , you just have to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and placed with the displayed map . select the area in question and zoom in . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a HTML page form to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general look and layout for each page . the option For each image a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise the image will appear directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ,
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you write permissions . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the rider thumb@@ nails allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during production . the web browser will be started automatically to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform base operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , an image will be displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG loss @-@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size rises because no compression of color information takes place . this can also be found in the PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please take a look at exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of Sli@@ deshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create a DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . afterwards you can create the module using Extras MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to reproduce the file on a TV , you must choose the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let them black . you can specify the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your preferences , you can start the creation of the movie with the encoding encoding . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or safely enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back .
if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button Settings right below .
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings for the white balance are to be used . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your pictures frequently or later use it later , you should not choose the JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as storage format , the metadata that contains in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , they have the possibility to automatically over@@ write the existing file . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sing .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck Package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck Package . you can res@@ ize or enlarge the image . in addition , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tionally ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre @-@ press preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo api@@ ece . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be seen before .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list and then add them to the list of images to be sent .
with the button images , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
once you have selected all the images , you can use the OK button to open the New message window of your email client . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you select are already attached as attachments .
make sure not to send too many pictures at one time . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used each time until you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the e @-@ mail .
the PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original i@@ if@@ dates will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window is not automatically closed so you can view the status messages in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation enable very elegant picture transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File Name option shows that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop option causes the presentation to be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually termin@@ ate it with Es@@ c .
the option to select pictures random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used for the order of pictures in the album .
the time distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . by chance , each transition between the pictures sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I Team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the work surface .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the image , are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
if you hit people with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images shown on which both persons are shown . by this selection method you can limit the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view preview images to view the images of your sphere of action .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can store your own thumb@@ nail , this of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right @-@ hand side of the toolbar . in the context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must define yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . in order to do this , you need to open the image pane window ( in more detail ) and select the entry categories in the context menu . in the View window , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the search in the main window , a dialog will show you which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog again on the picture .
if you enter a string in the Description field or description , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either part of the total data , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window you can search all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try out the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album and watch the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introductory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start for the first time , or select from the menu Help menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then , some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try them .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; view the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays data statistics about the images in your database .
you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed items preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview pane ) and the time bar always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate to the preview pane .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select a range , you will only view images of this period in the preview pane . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two possibilities to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can access via the menu file HTML ...
before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three fields of content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more closely .
first , enter the title of the moment and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you will see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . more information about the export files can be found in .
finally you can choose which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without any description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . therefore , you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically addressed .
on the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . by this , those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download pictures that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified . so , it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
the best way to choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images will be stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser is started after the pages have been created . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder , you will need to manually copy them there . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you just described have changed all three to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the images .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the fact that the images are stored in the file itself , or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all pictures into the file is that you can share all pictures and share this file independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the File Export menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold way . first , it searches the images that are in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will only be possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the manual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Manual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Automati@@ cally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you still want this , simply select the option export file .
the last option of this page is Maximum image size limit . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying , for example , that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the im@@ porting wizard consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window , which categories of the file to be imported , and what categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will see the different steps of ( 1 ) setting the information on your images , about ( 2 ) searching and viewing , through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and uses this in future starts automatically . if you want to re @-@ read another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you will get to a window where you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user manual , you will explain the various settings options .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is provided that can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it describes how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol .
in the Options dialog , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group rather than all groups of an intermedi@@ ary as explained in .
in the left window of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it shares its module system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
the modules can be called through the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but are sold separately . however , most modules have a help page that you can call via the module itself .
since the modules are used by several applications together , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . you can either call them using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications are just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates order after albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
in doing so , we simul@@ ate &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that the picture preview is showing you right now .
in addition to the current album , k@@ photo@@ album has to be released ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will use the category that you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category Person@@ s , it will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , so if you have selected people to view and pass this on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool bar at the top of the toolbar . at the moment , it does not contain a lot of information , since you do not yet have any information about your pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is the possibility to view any picture with comments . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image was taken , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is m@@ apped and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these remarks when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
here you can see three lists with a text box by selecting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , by the fact that the names used are moved upwards to find and classi@@ fy the persons more quickly .
if you prefer to display an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting icon by date under the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and add comments to them . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located at the top right of the picture .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the U.S. , and San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as a group . to show you that it is an over @-@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the comment dialog context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry to a category and drop it to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking the bar that forms the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window from a frame by moving it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which offers you among other things the ability to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you would like to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and here the window will fade out . this can be seen in the picture .
if you select the images in the browser , you will get an overview of thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you have no filter . you can configure the thumb@@ nails size by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will appear in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the preview preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete Select from the Edit menu . now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the images anywhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can record the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk .
the images showing the right upper edge are not stored on the hard disk . however , for images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so you can preview these images . you can also view these images using the image viewer .
as you see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and re @-@ copy them again . if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance on how to avoid the mess of your pictures , please buy a larger hard disk to store all images on it .
in the menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those left you want to make for others un@@ available and click Current View in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the images that your little sister may see , control and lock the menu entry Every@@ thing except current view .
this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item images , which will display all the images you have locked . if you want to get the images displayed again , click Lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in the Privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images can be accessed from the hard drive and on the other , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text .
the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to see them at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it shows , of course , the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if you want to see the information box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can easily drag and drop them with the mouse . you can also configure which information is displayed and if information is to be displayed at all . all of these options are available after right @-@ clicking on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see , appropriate entries to this view . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it to be changed into full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can enter the image in and zoom out . you can zoom out a rect@@ angle with the mouse button . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom out the plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and displays the result of the zoom .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the uni@@ formity button puts the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out zo@@ oming with the plus and minus key are .
with the swi@@ vel functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments on the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it may happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or poorly , while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to display pictures with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in the picture you will see a picture where the characters A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have noted characteristics on your pictures , they are available in the browser . so , if you print all the images you edit , print or whatever you &apos;ve selected , simply add all of them at once . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you show categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply clicking the characters for the feature after the image has been selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you &apos;ll allow &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the tag is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can undo your painted later .
in order to disable the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select On the image paint from the context menu . to exit the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; to work , you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully mastered , but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an object already selected , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button lets you remove selected objects from the scene before .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message with error description will be displayed . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly again or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User documentation in the direction dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as a default the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub@@ order element ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick local .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each object has a viewing level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the level of visibility chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as pres@@ et . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown to the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different orders .
to anchor a window above or below an existing view , drag the tap to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the start to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map Le@@ aders at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to resolve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the tap onto the desktop or click on the small left pointing arrow in the cham@@ fer bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place .
the current window view can be saved with View Window Order ... Save . it will display a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 does not support .
to render the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering The Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the View scene menu item .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full@@ screen in the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but a name that lets you see the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the picture cut for rendering into the input fields .
in the Quality Com@@ bin@@ ation panel you can select properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User Manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the representation . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature look better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard , an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling is the adjacent pixel . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is split up again and again because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between color values to the adjacent pixel exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are tra@@ cked separately and checked for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another option to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light re@@ flexi@@ on comp@@ utes . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray scene , select the Import menu item File Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full scope of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; render a scene . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in Properties view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User documentation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your document and the version . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 are supported .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height @-@ field data ) in the paths to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object reception of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects , such as the sphere , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
when you cross high levels of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and thres@@ holds . you will find more detailed information about the parameters in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders . the section window instructions explains how to create and store window orders .
the default window arrangement : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . a new order can be created with the Add button and delete a selected order with the Del@@ ete button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and delete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a card card view together with the previous view and floating the view does not anchor in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and now you want to start without closer knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything without error , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to frequently use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you must remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu .
the wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position .
when you apply the App@@ ly button or the Enter key , the wi@@ re@@ model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or enter the Enter key . in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed .
the wire model view now also shows the level , although at the moment only a limited final level . if you render the scene , the level expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit beneath the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple .
in both cases a dialog opens where you can choose how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ object . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = base pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments shows just a matte black material , because you have to enter settings for the pigment yet . therefore , always remember to check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and the ball in the preview , click the App@@ ly button and then press the Pre@@ view button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you now render your picture by clicking on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called single @-@ color . in the color list you must enter the entry color list . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , choose colour each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to do this step , since you should have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input key or the user button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise the ball would float above the ground because you moved the floor around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the next step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the ground , let the ball give a pigment as color :
select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on Ball Pig@@ ment , then choose Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
the settings shine effect and reflection already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not at all selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options you have &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a source of light , you can see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , any scene that is to be rendered is just a few light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage have been dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu item can only be selected if you have not yet saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ t command . this menu item can only be selected when you have used editing .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new layout or over@@ write an existing layout .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the key short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option to set pres@@ et short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can use this option to add and remove tool@@ bars for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to make rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with click the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialog Configuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the key short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . pres@@ etting is not a full screen mode .
if this item is activated , loading &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when you exit the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will also be filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right of the input field .
here , change the key short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
the factor is reduced by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame that you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report errors or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu provides a link with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can just follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo , then we would like to invite you to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; you can ask here questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to join the show@@ photo ; to join , it is the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you so much control over its workflow as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; to access these settings , you need to set the show@@ photo &apos;s behavior in the Options menu . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left .
in the range of exposure indicators you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you should display in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a light color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show@@ photo ; features a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view these in the image processing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan pictures that do not make any more than images to scan and save .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that do not make any more than images to scan and save . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialogue to save for each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not deal with these options particularly .
to scan a picture , the user can start a preview scan first and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if a preview is displayed in the settings before saving , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and sn@@ lie ? s will lead to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the button Settings button opens the same name dialog in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; edit images . open dialogue for each image opens the dialog in front of each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; these are automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking a file name .
this setting defines where the images are stored at option Save without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as the default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saving images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a numerical suff@@ ix that is saved each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes compression value when saving . if choosing image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE over -@@ Dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to quit .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global key short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ click into the player window and select Global short@@ cuts . click the right mouse button in the player window and select short@@ commands ... Select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog to allow the user to know why a script is not running .
start require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script .
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this purpose strings should be written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure is the script to display the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , further information about the new piece may query ( for example , the metadata or the play length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le tracks the path to the selected playlist files when a custom menu item is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le will also be passed to the menu to use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to perform , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be zi@@ pped with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with cat@@ amar@@ k script extension . for this reason , you should properly name your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining load@@ able modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can add it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . you may also search for a specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ tive browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which ones you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just right for you . and if your decision is still difficult , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to experience your music anew !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have no trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable to compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the compile options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; without effort to set up the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
display the player window in addition to the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tun@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
store mood files in the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored in the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser is to be started by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if a browser is required .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
to save the playlist when you exit , the current playlist automatically saves when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , are saved . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keep the current piece visible when changing the piece to keep the play@@ lists window open / un@@ rolled to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
changing the context browser automatically indicates the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fonts section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using proprietary fonts , the otherwise gray presented section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following range : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
by selecting Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . to do this , use the color selection enabled for foreground and background color .
resume playing at startup causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the shadow panel shade causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the opportunity to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color sel@@ ections . if the color is not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors are used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the audio output card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers enable even more settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name .
recur@@ sively Browse sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the scann@@ ed and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitoring : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders on changes ( for example , if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further installation is necessary in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator : to enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then under port : the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the cart@@ ei@@ karte last@@ .@@ f@@ m supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a load .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current unit if required .
enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send completed pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar performers : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers can be viewed from the play played . note : you do not need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs thus installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a little guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD assume that your window manager will stop the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file by logging in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash .
usually this is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes while reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok were compiled using the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes when editing met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , disable automatic switch off , if in@@ active for ... into setting the sound system , or at least use no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens on a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be corrected .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but they are not lab@@ elled as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random shu@@ ffle / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten . this can be done in the control centre under the look of icons .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
you can also search for help with other users or the developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error if there is something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces enter there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the interface intuitive , the Start window has been converted to the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for rating by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show review . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there , just like you would do with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the add button , the Play@@ list button is stored . click on it .
probably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must be Which Media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 decoder can be supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( Software Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. sho@@ sink ) .
do not forget that media needs to be deco@@ ded first . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , deco@@ ding it and sending the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :

either do not use the Arts Driver , instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster editing code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less iner@@ tia react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and then run @-@ register . start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and thus also a lot of error reports .
probably was &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you probably need a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how to use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
set up Amar@@ ok ... Audio output gives you the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 } ect@@ l.@@ c@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the setup dialog x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . of course , you are not allowed to take this problem by yourself ! if you would like , you can become the new so much needed main@@ tainer for Arts : )

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . additionally , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all the others . the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the currently running piece or current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will appear in an independent , magni@@ fying window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also included in the run@@ time display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , volume control , and play position slide control . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . playback buttons lets you start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pre @-@ settings , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ ds ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . however , let &apos;s not deter from the abundance of features , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side , the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser displays various information about the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser design . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will later become more detailed in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window will drop off . the information displayed there are now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . in addition , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first area in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you will see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to see the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you will find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . you will see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as the review .
to display cover images in context browsers , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if there is no text script running , you can choose which one to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . this does not require a running text script .
the search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only group the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First , the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further division is made after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are shown at the beginning of the list among different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are displayed in alphabetical order among each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ t - your pieces will be displayed first by genre and among them by performer .
group@@ ing genre / interpre@@ t / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folder . if you own a lot of pieces , this could take a while .
directly below the toolbar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes on the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter , there is a selection box that allows you to filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . there are various time windows available , ranging from the last 24 hours to one year . besides , you can of course also select your complete collection so that the filter is switched off practically .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following options .
download - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
app@@ end to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you will get the same effect .
set the pieces in queue - this feature inserts the selected pieces into the queue , so you &apos;ll be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
the media player moves the pieces into the queue to transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser .
burn all pieces of this artist / burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark as a compilation - Mark@@ ing the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
up@@ lifting - Chan@@ ges a record selected as a compilation of selected album back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the associated interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection that has never been played .
even created Smart Play@@ lists are possible . click Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart Play@@ list , where you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist .
the sub @-@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) , it needs to be embedded in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod before starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the performer list . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive binding for your iPod .
the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar that allows you to get music from a given URL . for example , if you enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can listen to music in musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult due to simple dropping . in this case , the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired position and drop . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed containing the letters . to reset the filter , press the button until the text box is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one or two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms OR search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , which contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then complete the search term with go@@ ose bum@@ ps : Mike Old@@ field . this will look for entries that Mike Old@@ field contains , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller searches . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something searches for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either include Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
you can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired sequence on the entries . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist toolbar is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button to add the play@@ lists to the playlist . to the right , you can save play@@ lists , empty the playlist , and Rand@@ om M@@ ic .
next , the buttons return and restore . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can view in the player window via the right mouse button . through this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and set toolbar buttons ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is easily changed by clicking the mouse twice in the corresponding display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the general settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . from this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
click on this entry to open the visualization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visualization of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the Cover Administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the Cover Administration includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the Cover Management . select from :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set one piece into the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces using the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( details to set up these will follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds other random pieces while playing .
adds tracks based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click on the desired playlist , drag them to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Up@@ load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one , so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of random@@ ly mix and playlist mix immediately fill out your playlist and you can add at least one piece of playlist to your collection . the recommended tracks will be added to the next piece change , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : setting Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point .
the New will empty the current playlist and add new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list to edit the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens for editing the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be passed and you will not hear a piece in that playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while setting the settings .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been recently played .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right have been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can choose from already existing play@@ lists and smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok , random pieces from each of the inter@@ viewed play@@ lists will be added .

O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis profits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( Z . MP3 ) are fully supported .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t w@@ ma files and burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you will need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the root folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project is changed and not yet stored , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . in addition , you can cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will request for each un@@ saved project , what to do with it , just as you would have called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project will be asked what to do with it , as if you had called file closing .
when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the pop @-@ up dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the extra button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the right mouse button .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD .
this feature only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files will remain in the project .
open the CD copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD which you would later burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
it also does not support copying a DVD to another medium without project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of a normal copy . the converting / decreasing a DVD with the help of copy dialogue is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even options to change the size and cut black edges .
this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of toolbar items from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents are displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the media .
the Content View allows you to select and drag files to your project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head@@ line is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line does not have any real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for System Administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here you can set general program settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work straight away . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ ds ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script , for example .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and nature of your task are decisive , which of the programs you give .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the D@@ CO@@ P command line , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill up a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders , and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; it is an audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible depending on the enco@@ der installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and supported by many enco@@ ders that encoding these wa@@ v files ( This enco@@ der packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all of these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions . however , only the enco@@ der packages must be installed which are needed . for example , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which enco@@ der / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does not cover the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be accessed as often as a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling of the reading of a &amp; CD ; is explained on the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or work completely without a network , with everything manually captured .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example , there are more information about how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
start the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the creation of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - when an enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the default . note that before the enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already selected file is selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; terminated ) .
opens the main direction dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different card cards ( such as enco@@ der , to set the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes audio quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoding .
if no audio information is to be lost , loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; gre@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that loose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate differences are less important because both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless provided free with most distri@@ butions but there are open license questions
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ instruments is present .
MP3 - if music is also heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - beginning 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format .
a short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ press extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires less than 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approximately 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good pleasure for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ San@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality regardless of the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information entered manually or fet@@ ched from fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use it with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the encoding program to generate folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters needed ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information , so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the computer . it &apos;s important to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translator ) is not lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information publicly available on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be done harm .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; actively select a check box ( Send an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b it may be used with another ( fake ) address than the used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; for using fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which output program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more about it , look at source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the proper distribution if this has not happened yet .
for saving the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the encoding . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the enco@@ der package must be installed by the concerned lin@@ ux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a enco@@ der , more information about his switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understand everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found using a search engine , because it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg by trying to copy something into it with the Con@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each read &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( mp3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are lazy , we share the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any read on a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device identi@@ fier of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing records of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the cart@@ ei@@ card general settings . here there is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is shown as left / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information requests , so that you are informed when information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during the reading of the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second check box is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Con@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; cap ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database beforehand . to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls boot the 88@@ 80 protocol by default , perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously missing pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore just try yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something yourself with the wa@@ v files .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is an adjustment for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in the event of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously encoding WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have clever@@ ly selected the organisational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the Internet is established , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is described .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different than those for a &amp; CD ; with successful data fet@@ ched by fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually instead of retri@@ eving them from the internet . comments will indicate the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not been done yet , now the &amp; CD ; into the drive that was defined in the main window must be inserted .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , check the FAQ section and ask for the help section or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been successfully collected by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; a window will appear and you can select the database entry that will best suit your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step@@ 2 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the sample on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; input field .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; input field unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally each piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful retri@@ eval of data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words are upper@@ case or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the encoding settings tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
just choose an entry that obviously agrees with the style of the released CD ; in this example , this is not important since we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under skir@@ t .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you get back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all Tit@@ le data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the piece list .
note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece to or from . make sure that all the pieces are selected , or select the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time .
by clicking on the button selection from the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what happens .
click on the Ri@@ ders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the kno@@ bs of the toolbar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message shows you if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows to read and coding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and coding . the machine used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( however , two different pieces ) .
now the last song is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is written in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; cap ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; will maintain CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package today . however , if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already include a pre @-@ compiled package , because &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ package . if you read this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is directed to people who compile from source files and not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package from their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs when it &apos;s running , then the following is true for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different card cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hi , still to read ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first startup of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or change something useful , may do it . at least after contacting the author . and if you read this , he left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this suggestion .
strange if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; apart from others , he has also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the method used .
session support . when you finish playing a song , k@@ mid starts with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; mid@@ size window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the item from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will start automatically as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( for several pieces they are added to a collection and then played succ@@ essively . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play one piece , you can jump to any point by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the regulator .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ ad and change the playback speed . in order to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two functions : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . num@@ b the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use lyrics , others use lyrics and others . some pieces don &apos;t have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which one song uses , so you do not need to manually adjust the Kara@@ oke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to specify an event type , select text events and / or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played according to the series . in this section stands how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find this in the collection below the item Organ@@ izing .... click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can choose the one you want in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . consider this if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . in turn , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opened ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
when the Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the still opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menus collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re @-@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button previous piece , previous item from the menu item or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General MIDI . in this case MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type and lets it sound a trumpet when it was originally intended to play a piano .
if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required implement@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section which may appear as often as desired . however , the requirement is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
default P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; A more key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI can be m@@ apped onto your specific keyboard . general usage is as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument need to lay on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard for example does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot .
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Dru@@ mm@@ al patch the patch is meant to represent a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ment instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as , etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound is the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards own ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are m@@ apped onto a particular channel or instrument .
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of the lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . see for example the supplied key maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to trade the first and the second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map is used with the name name for this channel . of course , if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this channel . in this case patch x will always be used .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates which ratio Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM tells you that a keyboard , which gets a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , will play a note higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; walk around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . this can be found in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( up to now ) has two different views to display the played notes . in the View menu , select Settings under the View Channel View : settings
the tempo @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the higher the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without having AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all the files separately .
agree to that support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I open on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or h@@ opped ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file , simply switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you just want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , turn off the Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. Rand@@ all just want to play the first file . so set the Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play for B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to gain some time for hob@@ bies .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me simply happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kara@@ oke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file will be included ( if you want to ) . before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and no one gets money for it . I would like to stress that I only use it because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also goes to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ he@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course my thanks also goes to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke files .
in addition , you can find &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and view images . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ o , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is displayed only when information is reproduced in it .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive additional hierarch@@ ies . if you have an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , the menu has to be selected with play@@ lists from the menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost if the edit mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and change &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 based option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . if the files are ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml , the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying in the end animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ suits ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; file : / / / ; ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the directory testing / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L are supported by &amp; S@@ ME ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Configuration dialog of &amp; S@@ MB ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; console &apos; button in the toolbar of S@@ ME . here , the output of mp@@ layer is visible .
there is no tab for this device in the Configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , such as setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a flash with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ ME ; it can even be inserted into the special embed embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; S@@ ME needs ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the Back@@ end Output is within &amp; S@@ MB ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that a given back@@ end for a certain mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manually modi@@ fying the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play cards from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the need to be used and the TV channels must be used . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the S@@ Player , the dialog is in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected by which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support for S@@ ME can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video @-@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally , S@@ Player uses different names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
are there hints how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be executed as user root after connecting the device . it is essential to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .

G@@ opher originally started as a distributed campus information system at the University of Minn@@ es@@ ota . G@@ opher enables the user to access information on G@@ opher servers on the Internet .
G@@ opher allows the user to save the position of a desired information in a bookmark ( book@@ mark ) . thus , the user can access the information using the bookmark directly without having to browse the entire menu . G@@ opher menus are not standardized so that each g@@ opher server provides specific information .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; dump ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . among Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the box ; -@@ Website should be made .
if you have questions about or comp@@ iling &amp; Ki@@ le ; on or if you wish to add extensions , please refer to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this easy , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . additionally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; kate ; and to learn its possibilities the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; kate ; start .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right choice : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . at &amp; lat@@ ex , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction includes at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again using the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the Quick @-@ In@@ step Wi@@ zard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for spe@@ edy creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers a few options for the creation of the document . some settings can also be made to the document .
document classes : this defines the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , film &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this is set to set the character encoding . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . best use should be UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for inclusion , they only need to be balanced in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the preparation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source editor - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see gre@@ ener areas of a green text on the screen , it is most likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , you will be spar@@ ed due to the modest appearance of the output file .
automatic execution of environments is created when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically generates an empty line ( for instance \ \ end } command } . this function can be set in the menu Settings box ; setting up La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into several elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the document sub@@ division into the following elements ( part is the most important and sub@@ paragraph of the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective object .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex file . once a DVI ; file has been created , &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the appropriate line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the commercial output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the check @-@ out search , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected to the editor and once on an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding section is j@@ umped into the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was cli@@ cked , the corresponding place is j@@ umped into the DVI ; viewer .
master Document : this function is used for working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
fast Construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ mitt@@ ed@@ â &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and there is no call to &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the fast construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the editing toolbar , the three large selection fields should be conspic@@ uous . the selection fields have been developed for the fast insertion of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down box is for the fast insertion of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the Other is for the introduction of items such as keywords , mer@@ ges or references . the options available are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or a different element is created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; reference : used for reference to a specified term ( select a selection field possible ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when using quotation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; works only if the file is attached to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files may also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; manually written by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size . it can be used to define the font sizes for the main text , the mer@@ its , etc . there are the following fonts to be available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch by hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font size . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the built @-@ in menu or the push button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; performs the storage automatically .
if the document fails , it should be searched for errors in the logging process . if rapid construction should be started &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size is created 12 and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow to change the font size within the environment â s &apos; Gi@@ ant &apos; .
the changes will only be checked within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no reduction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to achieve read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , grease pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics and is as long as it is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be represented itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ;
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , some adjustments should be made for better read@@ ability of the document . this should include a quote , a few spots in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor View or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) .
once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is a device independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed with file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin using the buttons in the toolbar .
the search allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . to do this , only Modern under Settings Ki@@ le must be set up ... tools building can be balanced .
in order to carry out the search , the mouse cursor must be positioned in a row of the source code and then cli@@ cked on before search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Oc@@ ular ; Set as text editor ( Settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
should there be errors in using the quick @-@ making of the &amp; DVI , a fault can be present . if there is an error , this will be summ@@ ar@@ ised in the log file or in the message window .
the log file explains the source of error in the source code . in the editor , the simple La@@ Te@@ X errors and the La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for explo@@ sions between the errors . the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears . in order to view the incorrect line , the error in the logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the error line .
once the corresponding button is cli@@ cked in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting empty documents , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document . more information can be found in the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved , and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file is created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by exec@@ uting an existing document and selecting a file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Settings can be set .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in document class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . as soon as the document is created in this way , the following steps have to be executed :
when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of the default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created by a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and searched under described steps .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as an internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and producing many different types of text files ( among them also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Po@@ sters ; can be done in the menu directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about posters ; and its possibilities to learn the manual can be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex command reference , which can be accessed over the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex , and its syntax .
double @-@ click with a pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on the \ \ par of \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ .
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pulled Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search for different types of source texts and highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional jump marks . this is a special kind of book@@ marks within the text . the menu items Edit boun@@ ties or the corresponding keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; Even though &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offers excellent possibilities , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code always supports many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
specifies a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning is not meant to include a text with single lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two blank lines .
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; provides the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for a faster resolution .
a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description of Edi@@ ting Out paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for other commands in the editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command is used to jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command is used to jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to enter the environment .
if the cursor is before or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command will close the recently opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environmental structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups defined by clas@@ ps { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment .
this command is used to jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the welded clasp .
if the cursor is before or behind the sharpen@@ ed bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of ne@@ sted loops , the overview can quickly be lost . this command will close the recently opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple indications are used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; used for two simple calls is used . &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and supports two closing signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic insertion of the double bond marks can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
it can also be used ad specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
pressing Shift ; input key for &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a new@@ line break but also the command \ \ item .
close in a tables environment t &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ to @-@ end line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby arrange all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . by pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab@@ ul@@ ator in the adjacent line . although this tab@@ ul@@ ator is unfortunately not the addition , add &amp; ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offers a good source code completion , this has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; three different modes are installed for different modes . all of these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings box ... can be adjusted .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the button , the last letter of the input is removed and the default list may be gr@@ ated . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from &amp; Ki@@ le ; alternatively jump marks can be added , so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible using the Edit @-@ Trade@@ mark Tag Tag and then the desired parameters can be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... boxes ; can be done settings to these lists . there may be several wi@@ dening lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as books of general language use can be balanced .
command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of completion mode will have a large e list with ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of environments .
the command to open the environment is automatically captured and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient completion can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key .
once this has been done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; detects that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings box ; set up ... box ; default settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations that can be replaced immediately by longer strings . lists can be set up under Settings box ... boxes can be set up . as an example of a drop @-@ down list , the ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l file is used , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word mis@@ reads mode over the menu , or pressing the key C@@ trl + Alt , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large numbers are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been noted that many books in a document are written more than once . there@@ with , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written documents .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... boxes can be disabled . here also the threshold value for the display of completion can be specified .
the execution files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the Persian home folder .
the graphic images reflect the insertion of graphics as simple as possible . to clear the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be followed .
PS files are not as known as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and re@@ orders from pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to examine the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are compiled in group style in the creation of comp@@ iling , converting and creating views .
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard short@@ cut Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the default viewer using Alt ; 3 , by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no one @-@ in @-@ one viewer is used , a new window will be opened every time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a new project will be asked about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Menu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project . for this purpose , the following information will be asked for the project : &quot; &quot; &quot;
when exec@@ uting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the exec@@ uting of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed across scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the packages included and another lat@@ ex ; reference .
it is not just a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather is a complete user manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; supplied , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible assistance , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or activating the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source editor that can be found on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; working space environment . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , causing &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with OS @-@ X installed .
many thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project aim and offer for many hours for the development of tools we all use in compliance with the &amp; GNU ; license .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use com@@ mander as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination yields fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in a ge@@ orer working folder , then leave the current folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous and HTML files will be deleted every time my pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current folder . if not , select the current folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is defective . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be reviewed is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then they simply drop the current file . if not , they delete the check in the current file and select the file to be examined by means of other file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is , click the Well @-@ formed check selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the Location of &amp; DT@@ D ; using definition UR@@ I ; file selection .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed is selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then you simply select the current file . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by the other file choos@@ er .
enter the file name as the result is named , and the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; spaw@@ n , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves possibly little to do . this makes the plugin system very powerful . you can benefit from additional functionality instantly and do not have to wait until someone uses the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plu@@ gins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start with the Edit Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all the plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . if plu@@ gins are added without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to the search of the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several people work in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and serves for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can search for himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( her identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for more information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : there can be an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see add@@ res@@ see in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see how such conductors are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from regular comments through the following things :
notes are simple . either the note entry from the editor context menu can be selected or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project manager Accor@@ ding to the area and sub @-@ project leaders , the corresponding area or sub @-@ project names should be given as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are sensitive to upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and the names : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
settings can be set up by Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog covers some pages that are treated one after another .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
great / L@@ ump@@ y of tags : large / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal upper / lower case means tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lower case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal upper / lower case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if ange@@ ha@@ kt , will be added to tags for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ;
not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
start and end tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic insertion of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
M@@ IME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the Standard button .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the chosen DT@@ D is used for newly created files or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regularly backup copies so that during a power failure or crash the next start of the program can restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
previ@@ ewing and docum@@ enting can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a box ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default setting at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / dropping views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message section is used to control the possibility of displaying warnings by hooks of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of par@@ ser knots in the document , can be set into details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ g@@ gle Settings section , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
the area to set abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which will be un@@ folded when editing to extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid , there may be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ ass abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
plug @-@ ins are part applications from third party which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
loading component in &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , then save the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left do@@ ck .
a view in which all the holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action is used to connect to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sound according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to de@@ duce a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start execution of the script and to send information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , execution continues . if it happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start execution of the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution continues . if it happens before a de@@ bug is given , the execution will start as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include is corrected .
instruc@@ t the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over the directive and go to the next one as if the current does not exist .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can adapt to your needs and how you can help .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages respectively &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , which &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic key of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever have .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and the content of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a writer .
tag folders are nothing but a folder . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag @-@ folders carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but does not contain anything other than just element type .
the type of the tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
only valid for day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for Type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are additional tags describing how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
specifies the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag which groups the elements of a list together . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be available for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a only element type .
specifies a list of elements that end one day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; can be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to start and review Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check is performed only when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following example , for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D Mach@@ ined DT@@ D settings . this can be edi@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P file ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Ver@@ sions 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D input . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New Action to the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the user button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current key short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document to the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the quick start dialog or the different see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document file is removed : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is inserted to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods , a script can accept input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard output , can be specified by setting the output field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it , enable dialog &quot; Edit tag &quot; when available to enable input when using the action .
Ig@@ or ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics More programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least indicate a message to the user that clicking this icon will be a &amp; lt ; start@@ gt ; -@@ Tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and select the desired action . besides the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared for a better overview by some divi@@ ders into multiple groups . set the toolbar to set up dialog by setting toolbar settings . make sure the desired toolbar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to have a quick access to the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar might think that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by hal@@ ving all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
backup to the right folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their toolbar ( s ) loaded when a file is opened from the appropriate folder .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like best . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to find an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , for the documentation HTML files e.g. PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = func@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the section now in the &amp; PHP documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
notice the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you notice that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything , but look at &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
the contents section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file that serves to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help the documentation would be shown directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list and the file connection lines .
a simple list of contexts separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specify it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the missing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . in different places there is an email sending menu entry , like DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) send by email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and only available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication .
when you upload , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the dialog New resource you have to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking on OK the upload will be started .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload toolbar toolbar , and start the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and marking . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please read the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears indicating the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages that are currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag@@ XML format might be necessary . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that is to be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P file ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Description line : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type Tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , fetch &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand and understand the full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first acquain@@ t oneself with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . it stores everything that is marked globally , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; saved . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that only this user can use them personally .
project @-@ related items are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool bars with special actions especially for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ fies the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool bar . please consult , and for further information about these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with current document entries , such as closing the current , other or all card tab@@ s , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ marking or exec@@ uting CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor area will lead to a further context menu concerning the processed document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse cursor , or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate , navigate , open and strip information in the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the presentation with cart@@ ei@@ ders , for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree @-@ view are available .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be performed using the contex@@ tual menu displayed .
another possibility of &quot; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus &quot; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , parts of the program , a whole website , etc ; all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to access the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking on an element , a list of commands will open in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab displays all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts executed , give any error messages ( such as there are ) in this window .
die &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they are shown the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the toolbar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure and HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that be the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; society ; Develop@@ er community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what has already developed someone else ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ framework is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itting actions , scripts and tool bars , automation is possible almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is provided with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section on templates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML while inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; writing which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; shift ; key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script gives error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of script actions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
starting and switching of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries preceding or next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents will be grouped in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in Chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details explained .
loading a project tool bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar buttons . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions need to be set by settings actions ... added . toolbar buttons are saved by tool@@ bars toolbar , or you will be asked when you exit whether you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from your hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the toolbar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or anyone else made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities are to be fresh@@ ened out of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not present , the shop fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . smart inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool bar refuses when this day contradic@@ ts the rules at this place .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the above menu items . clicking on an activated plu@@ gins will disable it .
sel@@ ects the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available emphasis schem@@ ata depends on the plac@@ ards ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D , using the external application ti@@ dy .
instant switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching over time may sometimes need time or unpleasant graphics . recommended is flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog influence any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
addresses the behavior of the editor window . in the Docum@@ entation of &amp; Po@@ sters ; details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar , or add them and change the sequences .
this should create a help corresponding to the mouse poin@@ ter &apos;s environment , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , as for example after completing the project name the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ e.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to add files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . if you have server scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project should be attached . if a project is started anew from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can select an exact selection according to your own discretion .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in menu with project properties in the sub@@ window profiles or with Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders ) that are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this can be used to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the profile upload profiles , upload profiles ( see below ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing your own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration window , you can switch event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced at present .
to open another project , select project ... from the project menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the right mouse button context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows you to remove the current profile . if only one profile is available , the button will be f@@ aded out to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten by programmers . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password on the disk will not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialogue if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ load profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server &apos;s name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just one set of files and tool bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project or Project toolbar , accessible through Settings Tool@@ bar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has the most to do . this not only increases productivity , but also allows adjusting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best viewed using the toolbar toolbar . usage and addition differ . adding tool bars is described below in the Ad@@ ding tool bar section .
the toolbar and the icons on it can be set either using context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the toolbar ) , in which new action , a new toolbar can be created , other actions can be defined , toolbar or toolbar toolbar , which can be specified , which actions on this or other toolbar should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries action and action will be displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a usual fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory existing to the system into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you set for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions listed at the beginning of each template prior to use .
binary templates are normally inserted in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template @-@ tree under global templates . more information on the Tem@@ plate Tree is available .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents are created in corresponding sub@@ folders . you can find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents , based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment to a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , combined in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template Save As local template ....
as soon as this is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template @-@ tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply dra@@ gged and dra@@ gged onto the tree view templates .
creating binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used to drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files tree view to a folder on the right and create a site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can also be stored as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can create header and foot@@ er or dynamically linked with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates / templates / templates / templates . each folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , click on the folder with the right mouse button and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types described before ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as par@@ ental attributes are cli@@ cked .
this is enabled by default and adapts to everything except the master folders in the template overview . if a root folder would be set like this , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
this could be general header lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers by copying content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
additionally you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor that can be accessed through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor through the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; site and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to source editor when necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit , the source editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 is activated , this mode is already active , pressing the active cursor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is configur@@ able via Set@@ anta settings .... After choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in the selection automatically the time interval can be set . basically , the recommendation is : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to select document properties . this means the processing of invisible tags during work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this can be changed :
met@@ a tags allow storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in a browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change on the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
using the cursor is as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using button or ran@@ ge@@ key .
the insertion of tags is done in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags will not be removed , e.g. if an anchor tag is inserted with text , any other anch@@ ors tag must be removed .
some tool bars such as the T@@ ables Assistant or the Listen Wi@@ zard are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examining style sheets . unlike other style templates , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be followed .
um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; cap ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;
hold in a template , in one place in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , wa@@ sting stops can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a file name without path input . file names in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g If for example loading a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ age called my@@ ME or a specified model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template agrees with any QNAP template containing the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP ME &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested di@@ pping point must be dis@@ b@@ anded for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . the stops are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time adjusted the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts when merging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no reference to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was comparing and merging folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result to be expected . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when merging folders :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if rows are only different in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
when a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders then you can make typing work easier by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
K@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ ner@@ 1 Fol@@ ner@@ 1 Fol@@ ner@@ 1 Fol@@ ner@@ 1 Fol@@ ner@@ 1 Fol@@ ner@@ 1 Fol@@ ner@@ 1 Fol@@ ner@@ 3 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o Dest@@ ination folder
the Open dialog allows manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the Open dialog notes your selection and displays them next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C blank , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed .
via the Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders is initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
if coll@@ isions are crossed , the input field will be active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the Configuration button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the Open dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you only need to create two corresponding files , load them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you cannot extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merging ) .
when differences have been found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are relevant only in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare single cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is displayed on a broken line .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the header output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have finished the result . usually , it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each left will appear a black bar .
sometimes by automatic merging or by manual editing no more line is left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no line in the source ; this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a marker you might copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if the sources ignore the options numbers or ignore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side down , beginning , end , str@@ g beginning and str@@ g end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the dialog window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the insertion button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ picture Up / Str@@ g @-@ picture Ab@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict .
to copy the mark to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . there is also the option selection automatically copied . if this is enabled , whatever you mark , will automatically copy to the clip@@ board and copy the manual copy . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the new@@ line + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line ends of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when you exit and restore the next start . ( menu Settings &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered to@@ ast@@ ert . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically set an odd color .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted .
when you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copy the manual to the clip@@ board then .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used operating system .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters will not be ignored . even when merging white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others only save a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , others only save a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , but then they may be treated with different sizes in the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , although they are treated differently . while merging this option , this option must be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
the option is enabled by default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in the auto @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is passed on .
this is useful when white characters in many files are less important . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use the Move A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge . check for details under documentation for the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version is app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
change the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is globally set over the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately . by activating this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
above the selection fields for coding , a brief indication of what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the preview command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of preview commands .
turn on this to supp@@ ress emphasis on changes in white characters in text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when comparing three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ co@@ ded overview column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply aperture the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide un@@ expect@@ edly to merge the files together . a simple click starts merging and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart merging , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your requirements .
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal post @-@ processing command was specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command line . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l are completely sufficient .
use this command line for line synchronization to convert the input to upper case : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword generated text $ . you can change the list by default : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps you might like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another preview command for line comparison . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so basically deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the composition from one another . for example :
instead of sed you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / Reg@@ Ex@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for viewing and merging . subsequent operations only change the data of the line interval al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the string comparison pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively and merge them together .
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the suggestion before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate the merging and display the simulated changes without actually carrying it out ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
when three folders are merged , Fol@@ ner@@ 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , you will inform a small message window about current progress . if you cancel the scan scan , only the files that have been compared to that point will be listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the folder menu contains two functions , fold up all sub@@ directories and unlock all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as seen in the above picture , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered the same when their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started .
the synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; after merging copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) , then investigate &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the same date appears , error message error : files are different , but the date is identical .. As long as such errors are not removed , merging the folders cannot be started .
while merging , one file will work after the other . it indicates the status column when merging has been successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at one time . if you have selected all the merged actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can launch the merge .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then the Three @-@ folder merge mode C will be used as the target , in the two @-@ folder merge B will be chosen as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a destination .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries could be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : start / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merging actions , a message appears indicating the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Browse , Simulation and Canc@@ el .
choose Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , a merging window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
if you are ready with a file , start / restart the directory merge again or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , an appropriate dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you will have the option to select another action for the entry , or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , the entries ( in the current session ) will not be merged again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called Directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( for example * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the Element@@ Tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the Element@@ Tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a preceding point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated by default .
if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is turned off .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be quicker to compare just the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security .
similar to the change date . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered the same when they are equal to size . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
activ@@ ates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the merge suggestions are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are saved in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of merging the newer file will be proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it is presum@@ ed that the other file was not modified either . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not just merging whole folders . this option is enabled in default .
usually the folder merge view remains visible to merge individual files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the option directory &amp; text windows to switch main windows in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text windows .
you can also merge a single file directly without having to run the folder merge . to do this , use the current file merge from the merge menu . once you save the result , the status will be saved and the file will not be merged again if you launch the folder merge .
but this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : new
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relatively und@@ .@@ or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters need to be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file will always be adopted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or modi@@ fying dates . therefore , the permissions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ DE@@ V@@ Part from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then it removes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select the Con@@ text Menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this doesn &apos;t work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as Part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in k@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are compens@@ ars ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the diff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or get it like that .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure inst@@ alls in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , the lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines are next to each other , this is a more often the case .
the editor notices each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button . this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or the Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir specifies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copy to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . inser@@ ting ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift insertion ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position and replaces the current marker .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re@@ read the Ref@@ resh folder after changes to these options . )
this also means that identical files when merging are not copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be switched off in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they are removed when clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the working surfaces , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ tops as well as the applications in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , window within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved . the movement is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries to set up ... and exit . if , however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , Maxim@@ ize , View Desktop and Finish . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , window within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces .
when this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are shown .
cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is checked along with name , the names will be provided with file numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small window in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ spaces will be displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map displays a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N @-@ grid appear , as are known from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying on the side on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select switch @-@ down sel@@ ections ... the dialog settings will appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator .
since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base you will need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read in the newspaper read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that constantly enhances new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window . the image that appears in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is called in the following as a selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cursor as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor setting . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not yet able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fication window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy to the clip@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
restart or stop the display update . stopping the update causes the CPU time to go to 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
this mode displays a selection window . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your inserted short commands to store files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and smaller &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the ring@@ print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter is waiting for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people suffering from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mou@@ sec@@ lick can em@@ ulate pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also consult a doctor if this has not been done with the use of your computer .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool helps avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can fall out for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you inter@@ rupt the movement .
is the smart move activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button em@@ ulated . move now the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can pull the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little exercise , but you quickly get used to it .
this time of stay must be blocked after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if the intel@@ li@@ gible shift is switched on , the turn @-@ field shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button wa@@ its before it leaves the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking on mouse postpon@@ ement . if this function is activated , a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt ; the first time it is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the General tab . there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , it will start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; start at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically .
sets all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last press .
it is best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first of all with pres@@ ets . in particular , you should let off the smart move . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the smart shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds .
first you should be aware of which positions a mouse click does not have any effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not provide a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the reels . they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scratch the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you own a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another position .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces around the toolbar and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely to copy text , copy it to the clip@@ board , or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice :
do not use smart shifting if you just start using the k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click on the one end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and click the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . by pressing the mouse button a sound like a mouse click is played . then you know exactly when smart shifting starts the shift time . later you can use the intelligent moving even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activate the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter res@@ ins . this program has been developed for people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome and which cause pain to the mouth .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button . in this way , drag and drop can be performed using the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which dum@@ b users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation pro@@ positions that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command which is later used for the speech output of text . for more details , refer to the description of the setup catalogue .
on the second page , select the default text@@ book . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages without having to type them . of course , the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you define the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can balance the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included into the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for keyboard input of your sets ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory memory of the sentences already spoken ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have correctly set up k@@ mouth , you can input the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select from it sentences that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page description and the page K@@ TT@@ SD Sprach@@ dienste .
in the box of the flash@@ card voice output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the box below the input field , specify the character encoding , with the text passed to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation of your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
as a first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page are ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , der &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passages menu or the bar for text passages .
the selected text passage is directly spoken with the selection of In the input field . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially be entered only into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text@@ pas@@ say@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text passages , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text@@ pas@@ say@@ book will not be saved . select before saving , and / k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ pas@@ say@@ book is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of books or export them to a file . below the list , you can select the language for the dictionary in the input field in the input field .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is easily determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted .
with this option you specify a new , empty dictionary without entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary , you will create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided in two . in the upper part , the text passages are presented as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passages , you can only change its name .
actions such as new text passages or books or del@@ eting selected passages and books can be reached either by selecting the menu bar , toolbar or drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the sequence of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ iry memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ iry memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the exp@@ iry memory .
if this menu item is checked , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar is displayed above the editing pane directly below the menu bar . by clicking on the sh@@ un@@ ched left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another position .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the bottom part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . the bar is set by default above the editing pane directly below the toolbar . by clicking on the sh@@ un@@ ched left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another position .
probably you have not entered the command for the speech output correctly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )

in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax gladly swal@@ lows the last character of the text , so that an extra sign must be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the language generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use des@@ kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service page that appears in the &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who can &apos;t speak can be able to output text by the computer . it stores a list of already spoken sentences that the user can always re@@ print .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer , a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or launch k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows each application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .

before you can use it , you need to install the program speech @-@ dispens@@ er and set it correctly . see also
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no actors have been set up , the cart@@ ei@@ card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the flash@@ card general is displayed . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female voices , or those that differ in volume or speed . they can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the map Le@@ aders in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the box spokes@@ man will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you restart kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all speakers already established appear in this list . the preferred actors appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not provide a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines their priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; Desktop ; system .
select here a voice type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the box spokes@@ man . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; almost use . go back to the flash@@ card General and check if voice output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) so that the T@@ TS service starts from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map assignments to create and manage text jobs . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the voice @-@ sharing system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the General tab General to open this card . here you can set some general options .
mark this check box to activate the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this startup is successful , the card card will be displayed and you can create and read text jobs . see . remove the mark , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the Field Voice Output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check@@ box is marked and t@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the Control Panel when pre @-@ reading , it disappears once the preview is finished .
with the buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , pause and record text jobs .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for a job .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the C@@ TT@@ SD card is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and activate Voice Output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read , and select the text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML , pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible trademarks are also read .
in &amp; Po@@ sters ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read , and select text in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .

filter for string replacement offer a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; wrong @-@ st@@ ressing or fla@@ wed messages to correct . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by e @-@ mail , and additionally the expression / local / in@@ box , since this can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; t@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters text is processed before being sent to the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to b@@ ypass certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the working method of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained jobs will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of warning .
news have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you &amp; eg , you can read a lengthy text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; al@@ erts are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text orders . any order that you initiate by the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of lengthy texts that do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such one reads , this issue is stopped and terminated .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . it is delivered with pre@@ defined strings of strings such as : - ) by text or for the transformation of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ reform@@ ers use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ S@@ LT files are contained in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with selection filtering filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the cart@@ ei@@ card spokes@@ man , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules according to which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue to pass the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; alert is sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed below .
for setting up string replacement filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged for the associated replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Re@@ place column . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file that app@@ ends the entries from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click the &amp; C@@ trl key .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . die &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers you have to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 you may just enter .
the string implementation filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the Di@@ esen filter apply . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the \ \ s word \ \ . words must therefore be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions to write regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from a format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such de@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the filter selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker set up on the map board , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; Proc@@ ts ; a text sent to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected according to the speaker characteristics that the program provides , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; and the characteristics of the speakers set up on the map board can be over@@ written with the speaker selection filter .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call this with a click on the button to get help in entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to meet the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the dialogue selection dialog .
use these buttons to store or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the filter selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to extend it for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ops , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts , refer to the source code archive for k@@ de@@ k or download the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ops , first check if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ skri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; k@@ de ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program ect@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the creation of speech is possible directly and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into single phrases . the user can return sentences or abbrevi@@ ations , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application specifies text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it may specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its sex feminine , this will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen automatically . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in .
if you click Add speakers on the list of speakers to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the box for speaker setup will be displayed . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details of the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you have to enter the festival .
select the text encoding for text that is passed to festival . in voices that &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting is automatically made . in general , Western languages are used ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these slider controls adjust volume , speech speed , and pitch of the syn@@ thes@@ ized language . if you cannot select a few controllers and display this gray , the voice you have selected does not allow these settings to be selected .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forgot to click App@@ ly ) . see .
if this check@@ box is marked , the program window is displayed in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the icon in the system section is visible after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check@@ box is marked and t@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , number of sets and the currently edited sentence . the or@@ ator ID corresponds to the ID column on the box speaker .
with the buttons in this row you can proceed to or back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
by clicking on the OK button , all changes to the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and t@@ m@@ gr is res@@ ized to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen re@@ a@@ ders , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; t@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds roughly half and 200@@ nbsp ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; Desktop ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them won &apos;t work . you &apos;ll need to figure out which device works for you . in doubt , choose standard .
this card card allows you to set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . once the screen reader has been read , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
news have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you have a long text read on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , add &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this tab only apply to normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen re@@ aders , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; t@@ ts ; to read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , restart kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the tab card noti@@ fications appear .
tick this check box to switch the reading of &amp; k@@ ds ; if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played is by &amp; t@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , which &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this field to specify what &amp; t@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :

the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice , the festival used in the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ level detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into single phrases . thus , only the first set can be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you can see the set limit detection filter . at the first start of &amp; t@@ ts , a set limit filter filter is automatically set up . you can modify its settings or add further set @-@ level detection filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn is to set up the selection of speakers . switch off the selection selection and enter text for reading . check the selection of the speakers , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you have to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; t@@ ts ; then proceed faster with reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then stop or cancel text assignments on the map sheet , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this feature .
for these reasons , the normal set limit filter filter is automatically set up when you restart kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limits recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator mark ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set borders ( tab@@ ul@@ ator marks are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( messages ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders .
if you have removed the normal set @-@ limit filter , you can insert it again by loading the contained file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
on the box selection box , you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the box speaker ) . in other words , there will not be any speaker characteristics .
use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of an appointed speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; t@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise select &amp; t@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the originally set of features .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select here the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not matter , enter nothing .
mark this check box if the property has priority over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
since the language is a critical factor when understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the set in the working environment .
to use all the features in the Spe@@ aker area , which is most likely to be deleted below , click the default Spe@@ aker button and then use the Spe@@ aker which is most likely to follow the following .
in this case 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number the input is 0 required ) .

I have invited an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it at festival , but respect@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ .ch . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you found the voice to the developers .
in order for this to work , the program must be so@@ x installed and able to be discover@@ able via the P@@ AT@@ H environment variable . some syn@@ thesizer modules such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card card for speakers . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the language settings are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter , and set up the speech speed .

I have added a own character chain replacement filter and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ wise pre@@ - or reset . on the Kart@@ ei@@ reiter orders are displayed , the order consists of only one set . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for syntax recognition instead .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you must install at least one language . to do this , please refer to the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , find festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option encoding must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output from it . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf provide the user with a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed at &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all allows to see and set the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up for the network hardware and other devices . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option is selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings option attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and release date . by marking the setting no @-@ re @-@ question the definition can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are shown in gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in system management mode , by clicking the button system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available , divided into three tab@@ s :
the tab Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Reiter Network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... set up in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options .
with the selection Automati@@ cally the TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the drop @-@ down list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the option manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching on an out@@ dated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switch off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
specifies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requires ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator part of the Rei@@ ters name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be placed in priority by selecting an entry and rec@@ lassi@@ fication or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list .
by clicking on the Add ... from the group machine to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group machine to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit dialog .
the list of names known as name accounts for the host name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting when there is no DNS server available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list contains some well @-@ known hosts some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os , and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be shown .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias names , de button Add multiple times and enter the alias names .
select an entry from a name that is known to name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Con@@ crete Calcul@@ ator will be shown .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Set@@ ting module are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , you have to set the following command .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and others .
this is recommended only for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter important information about basic network technology is given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files are discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( hom@@ e- ) network is communicated .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread distribution . from IP@@ v@@ 6 it is expected that it is going through in the near future .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the contact person to enter a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be used as desired !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are mostly used in the range of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 15 ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the standard route is needed for the IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address is assigned 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes modified dynamically at DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content than specified in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . to do so , select File Save .
alternatively , you can press C@@ trl ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables will only be active .
it appears the default node ; print dialog . if you choose to un@@ fold , you will see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced permissions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change user schedules .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be included in &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; press the tape back and read the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by opening the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape that the integration for the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the Status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
tape types need to be format@@ ted before you can use it to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process requires format@@ ting before using &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , DA@@ T drives are not format@@ ted .
after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with format@@ ting the tape continues . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be backed up . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is saved .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select the Save ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog box opens for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
once you have confirmed the settings , the backup will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the time remaining .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item ...
once the verification process has been started , the dialog will appear settings for checking . in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the working folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Rest@@ ore menu ....
once the restore process has been started , the dialog box will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
once you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will appear again . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can add the index to two types of the band :
as a result , a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings will be created . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current job folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be backed up is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered tar independent of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to device file for tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , the command will load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; block the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the release of &amp; k@@ dat will be dis@@ connected ; automatically ej@@ ected the tape . do not use this option with flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware file size for the tape drive is changed . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The tape ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the period in which the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for System Log@@ s . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files .
furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems encountered on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence try to provide some advanced features that allow the protocol files of certain programs to be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 features &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , features &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log will try to open the system protocol - the system protocol - it will not appear , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with System Administrator rights .
you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or string . add a string to the filter bar . the list of log messages is now automatically changed , so that only the log lines are displayed next to the filter . in the default setting , a protocol line is displayed only if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . for example , the string of the filter search term will only be matched with entries in the selected column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and then insert the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ strip , then show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines sent and / or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . record lines of level errors are displayed with a more striking color as protocol lines of level hint . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off in direction dialog .
if you only want to display certain processes ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can view the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu , in order to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. you will find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .

welcome to &amp; k@@ d ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it is quickly becoming the standard for controlling program start @-@ up during the boot of the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it .
I will not deal with historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc This is important because maybe someone could try to change a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . so you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc This folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you can find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to run when you run the system or change to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls are according to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be located under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run something that has to do with the serial port .
the kernel searches in various places according to the in@@ it program and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning , you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can manually edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you can fix it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called stop with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that can run only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; I could also have a user run@@ level , which &amp; gt ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other hand tool is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of the available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start ( or stop ) at this level .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within one level by removing it somewhere else . this will only happen if you remove an entry from the area of the available system services .
note : entries are moved when you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to recover entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to enable the various working ranges ( Verfüg@@ bare System@@ dienste , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry , press the button to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ ways , and now the machine is constantly re@@ launching . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions simplify configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not comply with any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and even if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without a message if their configuration files are not present or set up in@@ correctly .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either you can use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save item in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog User or group properties .
some cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card is created where you can make individual settings . more card cards appear if they are installed shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the card password management card appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if there is at least one restricted fil@@ esystem space restriction ( Qu@@ ota ) and is initi@@ alized ( recognizable to the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected by means of the File System File System with space restriction .
the groups of cards are informed about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the dialog Properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group , or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analogue .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the standard operating system , add , remove , modify operating systems , remove , modify , and more .
